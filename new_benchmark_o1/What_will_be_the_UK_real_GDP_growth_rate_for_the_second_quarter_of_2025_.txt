Analysis: 
At first glance, the UK’s real Q2 GDP growth historically ranges around modest positive percentages, although recessions and recoveries often occur, especially amid major shocks (e.g., financial crises, Brexit uncertainty, pandemic impacts). To form an outside view, it will be helpful to gather data on average Q2 growth patterns since the 2008 financial crisis and see how GDP growth recovered after past downturns. Additionally, cross-referencing Bank of England and IMF forecasts offers insight into mainstream assumptions. This historical perspective will serve as a baseline before adjusting for any 2025-specific developments such as evolving global economic conditions, UK monetary policy moves, or policy changes.

Analysis:
Given that we are interested in the UK’s real GDP growth rate for Q2 2025, we need fresh data points on macroeconomic trends, policy shifts (e.g., interest rate decisions), and leading economic indicators. Elements such as inflation rates, consumer demand, and trade balances are among the crucial sub-factors. Recent commentary from the Bank of England, private sector forecasts, and market assessments will be valuable. Monitoring the evolution of recovery post-pandemic, alongside headwinds like energy prices, remains essential for forming an inside view.

Here’s a concise summary of the BBC News article (11 April 2025):

Facts & recent figures  
• Monthly GDP growth: UK economy expanded by 0.5% in February 2025 (ONS).  
• 2024 quarterly growth: +0.7% (Jan–Mar), +0.5% (Apr–Jun), 0% (Jul–Sep), slight uptick in Q4.  

Definitions & measurement  
• GDP (gross domestic product) measures total output of companies, government and households.  
• Three approaches:  
  – Output: value of goods/services produced  
  – Expenditure: spending by households, government, investment, net exports  
  – Income: wages and profits generated  
• The ONS publishes a single GDP figure combining all three, but early quarterly estimates (~40 days after quarter-end) rely mainly on output data and cover only ~60% of the information, so figures are revised as more data arrive.  

Economic context & forecasts  
• February’s rise was driven by manufacturing and production gains.  
• The Bank of England (Feb 2025) cut its 2025 growth forecast from 1.5% to 0.75%, citing higher inflation (wages, national insurance, energy/water bills) and risks from US trade tariffs.  
• On 26 March, the Office for Budget Responsibility halved its 2025 growth forecast to 1%.  

Why GDP matters  
• Rising GDP typically means higher tax revenues, more jobs and pay rises; falling GDP (two quarters of decline) signals recession, leading to pay freezes, job losses and pressure on public spending.  
• The UK’s fastest such recession in 300 years occurred in 2020 during the Covid pandemic, prompting massive government borrowing.  

Limitations of GDP  
• Doesn’t capture unpaid work (e.g. caregiving) or distributional effects (rising GDP might benefit the wealthy disproportionately).  
• GDP per capita can fall even if total GDP rises, if population growth outpaces output.  
• Ignores sustainability and environmental impacts—alternative measures and an ONS well‑being framework (since 2010) seek to fill these gaps.

# Analysis of UK Q2 GDP Growth Trends and Influencing Factors (2008-2023)

The United Kingdom's quarterly GDP growth patterns since 2008 reveal a complex interplay of economic shocks, policy responses, and structural challenges. This analysis examines Q2 growth performance across three major crises (2008 financial crisis, Brexit transition, and COVID-19 pandemic), evaluates historical expansion patterns, and assesses the forecasting record of major institutions. The findings demonstrate that Q2 growth exceeding 2% remains rare in modern UK economic history, with post-crisis recoveries increasingly constrained by compounding structural weaknesses.

## Historical Q2 GDP Growth Patterns (2008-2023)

### Post-Financial Crisis Contractions (2008-2009)
The Global Financial Crisis precipitated a 5.9% peak-to-trough GDP decline from Q1 2008 to Q3 2009, with Q2 2009 recording a 1.6% quarterly contraction[15]. This period marked the UK's deepest postwar recession until 2020, driven by:
- **Financial sector collapse**: -2.8% contribution to GDP from financial services in 2008[15]
- **Housing market correction**: 15% annual house price decline by February 2009[15]
- **Manufacturing collapse**: -10.4% industrial production drop in 2009[12]

The Bank of England responded with unprecedented monetary easing, cutting base rates from 5.0% to 0.5% between October 2008 and March 2009[15]. This stimulus facilitated a gradual recovery, though GDP per capita took nearly eight years to regain pre-crisis levels[15].

### Brexit Transition Period (2016-2020)
The EU referendum's economic impacts became evident in Q2 2016 with:
- **Immediate currency shock**: 10% sterling depreciation within three months[4]
- **Business investment stagnation**: -0.7% quarterly decline in Q2 2016[12]
- **Trade disruption**: 10% reduction in UK-EU goods trade by Q2 2019[15]

However, isolating Brexit effects remains challenging due to overlapping crises. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that EU departure would cause 4-5% long-term GDP reduction[4], while pandemic impacts temporarily obscured these structural changes.

### COVID-19 Pandemic Shock (2020)
Q2 2020 saw unprecedented economic collapse:
- **Record GDP contraction**: -19.8% quarterly decline[15]
- **Household spending collapse**: -20% reduction, led by hospitality (-88%) and transport (-95%)[15]
- **Labor market disruption**: 9.6% unemployment peaking in Q4 2020[12]

The government's furlough scheme supported 11.7 million jobs at peak usage[15], while Bank Rate remained at 0.1% through 2021[15]. Despite rapid nominal recovery, real GDP remained 3.1% below pre-pandemic trends by Q4 2024[12].

### Comparative Q2 Growth Performance
Table 1: UK Q2 GDP Growth Rate Comparison (2008-2024)

| Year | Q2 Growth (%) | Key Influencing Factors |
|------|---------------|-------------------------|
| 2008 | -1.5          | Financial crisis onset |
| 2009 | -1.6          | Crisis intensification |
| 2016 | 0.3           | Brexit referendum      |
| 2020 | -19.8         | COVID-19 lockdowns     |
| 2021 | 4.8           | Post-lockdown rebound  |
| 2023 | 0.2           | Service sector recovery[8] |
| 2024 | 0.6           | Construction growth[7] |

Data sources: [7][8][12][15]

No Q2 expansion exceeded 2% during this period, with the strongest recovery being 2021's 4.8% annual growth[12]. The 0.6% Q2 2024 growth exemplified the "low growth trap" described by the TUC, where output remains 9.7% below pre-pandemic trends[4].

## Structural Constraints on Economic Expansion

### Productivity Stagnation
GDP per capita declined from £37,371 in 2022 to £36,977 in 2024 despite nominal GDP growth[12], reflecting:
- **Labor market composition**: Increased low-productivity service employment[3]
- **Investment drought**: Business investment growth averaging 1.2% since 2016 vs 3.9% pre-referendum[13]
- **Skills mismatch**: 28% of employers reporting hard-to-fill vacancies in 2024[12]

### Trade Pattern Shifts
Post-Brexit trade reorientation saw:
- **EU trade share decline**: From 54% of exports in 2016 to 47% in 2024[15]
- **Non-EU growth limitations**: 8.4% increase in Commonwealth trade offset by 12.7% EU decrease[4]
- **Customs complexities**: 22% increase in export administrative costs[4]

These shifts constrained Q2 growth potential, particularly in manufacturing-intensive quarters.

## Forecasting Performance Analysis

### Bank of England Track Record
The BoE's GDP forecasts exhibited:
- **Post-crisis optimism bias**: 0.4pp average overestimation (2010-2019)[5]
- **Pandemic underestimation**: 2021 recovery exceeded forecasts by 3.2pp[11]
- **Institutional learning**: 28% accuracy improvement vs Treasury forecasts (2010-2023)[5]

Recent enhancements including scenario-based forecasting reduced medium-term errors to 0.9pp vs 1.5pp historically[10].

### IMF Projection Patterns
The IMF's UK growth forecasts showed:
- **Excessive pessimism**: 2023 growth revised from -0.6% to +0.4% within six months[11]
- **Improving calibration**: 2025 forecast error margin reduced to ±0.3pp[6]
- **Structural blind spots**: Consistent underestimation of service sector resilience[6]

Table 2: Selected IMF Forecast Revisions

| Forecast Date | 2023 Growth | 2024 Growth | 2025 Growth |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Jan 2023      | -0.6%       | 1.1%        | 1.5%        |
| Jul 2023      | +0.4%       | 0.9%        | 1.6%        |
| Jan 2025      | -           | 0.9%        | 1.6%[6]     |

Data sources: [6][11]

## ONS Data Revisions and Methodology

Recent ONS methodological improvements include:
1. **Monthly GDP estimates**: Introduced 2018, reducing revision variance by 0.2pp[15]
2. **Digital activity capture**: 23% broader economic coverage since 2020[1]
3. **Supply-Use alignment**: Annual reconciliations cutting discrepancy to 0.1% of GDP[7]

These enhancements informed critical Q2 revisions:
- **2023 Q2**: Upwardly revised from 0.1% to 0.2% on services recalculation[8]
- **2024 Q2**: Unchanged at 0.6% despite construction sector reclassification[7]

## Conclusion and Policy Implications

The UK's Q2 growth trajectory since 2008 demonstrates diminishing expansion capacity, with no quarterly growth exceeding 2% and recovery periods lengthening. Structural headwinds including productivity stagnation, demographic pressures, and trade realignment require targeted interventions:

1. **Investment incentives**: Expand super-deduction schemes to 2026[13]
2. **Trade modernization**: Digital customs infrastructure investment[4]
3. **Forecast methodology**: Adopt AI-enhanced scenario modeling[10]

Policymakers must balance short-term stabilization with long-term competitiveness strategies to break the low-growth cycle. Institutional forecasters continue improving accuracy, yet persistent real-world volatility necessitates robustness-focused economic planning.</Perplexity_report>

1. Facts and statistics  
• Monthly GDP growth  
  – February 2025: +0.5% (ONS)  
• Quarterly GDP growth (ONS)  
  – Q1 2024 (Jan–Mar): +0.7%  
  – Q2 2024 (Apr–Jun): +0.5%  
  – Q3 2024 (Jul–Sep): 0.0%  
  – Q4 2024 (Oct–Dec): slight uptick (unspecified)  
• ONS publishes a preliminary GDP estimate ~40 days after quarter end, based on ~60% of data; later revised.  

2. Definitions and measurement  
• GDP = total value of goods & services produced (output), bought (expenditure), or incomes earned (income)  
• Early estimates rely mainly on output measure (data from thousands of companies)  
• ONS combines all three approaches for its “single measure” of GDP  

3. Reliable opinions and forecasts  
• Bank of England (Feb 2025):  
  – 2025 growth forecast cut to 0.75% (from 1.5%)  
  – Cites headwinds: higher inflation due to wage and employer National Insurance costs, rising energy & water bills, and potential US trade tariffs  
• Office for Budget Responsibility (26 Mar 2025):  
  – 2025 growth forecast halved to 1.0%  
• General view: steady GDP growth signals higher spending, job creation, tax revenues and pay rises; consecutive quarterly falls signal recession  

4. Limitations and critics’ views (unnamed sources)  
• Hidden economy (unpaid work) not captured  
• Rising GDP may mask growing inequality or falling per‑capita living standards  
• Does not account for sustainability or environmental harm  
• Alternative measures and ONS well‑being metrics (since 2010) attempt to fill these gaps  

5. Implications  
• Rising GDP → higher tax revenues → more public spending potential  
• Falling GDP/recession → lower tax receipts → possible spending cuts or tax increases  
• Historic context: 2020 Covid recession forced massive government borrowing

Here’s a concise summary of Vanguard’s “Our economic outlook for the United Kingdom”:

1. GDP growth  
• Vanguard has “modestly reduced” its UK GDP growth forecast for end‑2025 to reflect recent tariff announcements and weaker forward‑looking data.  
• Tariffs: the effective tariff rate on UK goods is expected to rise from 2% to 7%.  

2. Inflation  
• Short‑term: tariffs will boost core inflation.  
• Year‑end 2025: core inflation forecast has been nudged up modestly.  
• 2026: core inflation is expected to fall back to around the BoE’s 2% target.

Here are the key takeaways from the CNBC article “UK economy expands by 0.5% in February, more than expected” (Chloe Taylor, April 11, 2025):

Facts & statistics  
• February GDP rose 0.5% month‑on‑month (vs. 0.1% forecast by LSEG).  
• Production output jumped 1.5% in February (after –0.5% in January).  
• Construction output grew 0.4% in February (after –0.3% in January).  
• January’s early estimate of –0.1% GDP was revised to flat growth.  
• In Q4 2024, UK GDP expanded 0.1% (after flat growth in the prior quarter).  
• The pound strengthened 0.6% versus the dollar, trading at $1.3047 by 08:08 GMT.  

Named expert opinions  
• Suren Thiru (Economics Director, Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales):  
  – The uncertainty from potential 10% U.S. tariffs on UK exports “will likely override” February’s strong data when the Bank of England weighs an interest‑rate cut.  
  – “Financial market bedlam caused by Trump’s tariff announcements … makes a May rate cut look more likely than not.”  

Other context  
• U.S. accounts for 17% of UK trade (year to September 2024); new 10% reciprocal tariffs could hit exports this summer.  
• Markets (per LSEG) are pricing in a 25‑basis‑point BoE rate cut in May, taking the Bank Rate to 4.25%.  
• The UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility last month halved its 2025 growth forecast from 2% to 1%.

Here is a concise summary of BlackRock’s “Taking Stock: Q1 2025 Equity Market Outlook” (author: adespiri):

1. U.S. Stock Performance to Date  
   • S&P 500 total return through November 2024 rivals its full‑year 2023 gain of 26%.  
   • Two consecutive years above 20% total return have occurred in fewer than 10% of rolling two‑year periods since 1928. (BlackRock/FactSet)  

2. Market Breadth and Sector Dynamics  
   • Mid‑2024 saw a sector rotation and broadening: the “Magnificent 7”’s contribution to S&P 500 returns fell from 60% in H1 to 23% in H2 (through Nov. 30). (BlackRock/FactSet)  
   • Continued broadening is expected to create stock‑picking opportunities beyond mega‑caps.  

3. Prospects for 2025 Index Returns  
   • Historical incidence of 20%+ S&P 500 returns three years in a row is just 3% of observations since 1928.  
   • Mean annual return since S&P 500 inception (1957) is just below 11%; skilled stock selection could exceed that.  

4. Supportive Factors  
   • Election clarity and prospects of tax cuts/deregulation may sustain the rally into early 2025.  
   • U.S. macro backdrop: unemployment at 4.2% (Nov. 2024) and resilient consumer/housing metrics.  
   • Corporate change: Challenger, Gray & Christmas reports CEO departures in 2024 highest YTD since 2002; management turnover up ~40% vs Q4 2013. (BlackRock/AlphaSense)  
   • Long‑term “mega forces” (AI, aging populations, energy transition, geopolitical shifts, supply‑chain reconfiguration) fueling structural change.  

5. Earnings and Valuation Trends  
   • In 2023, “Magnificent 7” earnings outgrew the rest of the S&P 500 by 37%; projected to narrow to 7.5% in 2025.

   • Geopolitical uncertainty and potential inflationary effects of trade/immigration policy.  

7. Equity Risk Premium (ERP) and Style Outlook  
   • ERP is low for mega‑caps but near historical averages for an equal‑weighted S&P 500.  
   • Value vs. growth stocks are performing roughly in line through mid‑2024; growth momentum still intact but value may deserve greater weight.  

8. BlackRock’s Positioning  
   • Remain constructive but balanced—anticipate more normalized index returns and emphasize active, selective exposure across styles, sectors and geographies.  
   • Focus on nimbleness: “what you don’t own will be as important as what you do.”

**Qatar National Bank Expects Significant Slowdown in US Economy in 2025**
Qatar National Bank (QNB) expects a significant slowdown in the US economy, with GDP growth reaching 1.4% in 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024. The bank's weekly report, as quoted by Qatar News Agency (QNA), notes that uncertainty remains high due to the new US administration's bold approach to policy changes, which may have significant consequences for both consumers and investors. The report highlights that even in normal times, it is difficult to predict US policy-making, and that the current administration's efforts to 'review and revise policies' make it even more challenging. The bank focuses on market analysis to assess the impact of developments and trends on major asset classes in the US economy. The report notes that financial markets are a crucial indicator of the overall economic situation in the US, both in the short and medium term, as they reflect informed investors' decisions to invest in the real world, aiming to predict future developments or anticipate their potential consequences. The report points out that movements in prices across different asset classes reinforce the overall negative view of economic growth, despite some optimism related to potential tax cuts or the removal of some regulatory restrictions. The bank identifies three key factors supporting this trend. The first factor is the signals from the stock market, which reflect a significant shift from optimism to caution, as investors become increasingly concerned about the risks threatening future profit growth. The report notes that major US stock indices, such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, have experienced a significant decline from their recent highs. In this context, the report highlights that a deeper look inside the stock market and comparing performance across various sectors and factors reveals that capital is moving towards more defensive positions, with a preference for value stocks over growth stocks, and giving priority to public service stocks over cyclical stocks. The report notes that cyclical stocks, which are most affected by economic fluctuations, have declined significantly in a difficult economic environment, with the performance of small-cap stocks (Russell 2000) and transportation stocks across various sectors not meeting expectations, but actually entering the 'falling market' zone, with a decline exceeding 20% from their recent highs, reflecting indicators of potential economic slowdown. The second factor is the bond market indicator, which is more affected by overall conditions, as the spread between high-yield corporate bonds and long-term government bonds has widened in recent weeks, reflecting investors' growing caution and reluctance to take risks. Furthermore, various measures of the US government bond yield curve, which is the difference in interest rates between similar instruments with different maturity dates, have been reflected in the standard spread between 10-year Treasury bonds and federal funds rates turning negative again in February 2025. This standard spread is a key indicator of recession, as a decline in long-term bond yields indicates a decline in growth expectations, while an increase in short-term bond yields indicates less favorable financial conditions. The report notes that this signal from the bond market has preceded all seven recessions in the US since the 1960s, often appearing a year or two before the start of the recession. The report adds that the recent rise in long-term US Treasury bond yields reflects increasing market pressure and declining confidence in US government bonds as a safe haven, amidst growing uncertainty about US economic policies. The third factor is the strong warning signals from major commodity markets about a potential weakening of performance in the future, as gold prices have risen significantly, with a 30% increase since September 2024, reaching around $3,230 per ounce. The report notes that oil prices, which are a key input for economic activity like transportation and energy production, are still far below their recent highs, with generally poor performance compared to gold. This situation reflects a decline in the momentum of growth in the face of increasing demand for safe-haven assets not tied to a specific jurisdiction. The bank concludes its report by saying: Overall, market sentiment has changed, and various asset classes indicate a more difficult overall economic environment for the US, including stock, bond, and commodity markets. While we believe that recession expectations may be premature given the current high level of growth and the possibility of a more pragmatic approach to policy-making, we expect a significant slowdown in the US economy in 2025.

**UK Economy Shows Slight Improvement Amid Trade Tensions**
The UK's economy has shown a slight improvement after China's announcement to negotiate with the US on trade relations, following the imposition of large tariffs. However, analysts warn that the uncertainty surrounding the global trade system still poses a risk to investor confidence in the medium term. A recent report by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has lowered its expectations for global oil demand in 2025, citing ongoing trade tensions and slowing growth in several major economies. Oxford Economics has revised its growth forecasts for the UK and the world in light of recent trade policy decisions by the US administration. The organization now expects the UK economy to grow by 1% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026, down from previous forecasts of 1% and 1.5% respectively. According to Oxford Economics, exports to the US account for around 7% of the UK's total exports, with 3/4 of these goods currently subject to a 10% tariff, in addition to additional tariffs on cars. The expected increase in average tariffs on British imports from 1.3% to 12.1% is expected to lead to a sharp decline in US demand for them. The organization's estimates suggest that UK non-energy goods exports will decline by more than 5% from previous forecasts by the end of 2026. Andrew Goodwin, chief economist at Oxford Economics, believes that the current high interest rates compared to the 'neutral' level targeted by the Bank of England provide a justification for accelerating their reduction, especially in light of expected slowing demand due to tariffs. However, the Monetary Policy Committee continues to adopt a cautious approach due to ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain issues. A report by PwC highlights the concerns about the impact of tariffs on supply chains, which is reminiscent of the events of 2023, when supply disruptions and high inflation expectations led to price increases. In the face of the economic uncertainty between hopes of recovery and risks of slowdown, the effects of the escalating trade dispute between the US and China are becoming increasingly evident in several key sectors within the UK. The insurance sector is one of the most affected sectors indirectly by these tensions. Alex Bertolotti, head of insurance at PwC in the UK, notes that tariff increases do not directly affect life insurance companies in the UK, but they may pose challenges through their impact on investment returns, healthcare costs, and employment costs. The level of impact varies depending on the size and geographical spread of the company, with companies listed on the FTSE 100, which invest in multiple markets, being more exposed to risks than companies that focus on the local market. According to a report by PwC, the impact of the trade dispute extends to the private healthcare sector as well. Although many medical products are not subject to direct tariffs, the reliance on international supply chains makes the sector vulnerable to price fluctuations. The report highlights that the tariffs will increase the cost of some treatments, which will in turn affect insurance products such as critical illness cover. The British automotive industry is one of the most affected sectors by changes in trade policies, due to its heavy reliance on exports. According to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the US is the second-largest market for British car exports, with over 101,000 vehicles exported to the US market in 2024. With over 180,000 employees in the UK, any decline in demand due to tariffs could have significant consequences. In the face of these challenges, some companies are re-evaluating their strategies, including expanding their production presence in the US or establishing new production lines there to overcome trade barriers, especially if US policies remain protectionist. As geo-economic tensions escalate, several British companies are reassessing their supply chains. The high cost of imports, combined with the uncertainty associated with trade fluctuations, is driving companies to diversify their sources of supply and reduce their reliance on external markets, in an attempt to build more resilient and stable supply chains.

**Russian Economy: 'Soft Landing' and 'Shock' Scenarios**
Analysts from 'Expert RA' have outlined two possible scenarios for the Russian economy: 'soft landing' and 'shock'. The 'soft landing' scenario assumes a gradual slowdown in economic growth, with inflation reaching 6.5-7% by the end of 2025. The key interest rate may be reduced to 18-19% in December. This assessment is more optimistic than the Central Bank's February forecast, which predicted inflation of 7-8%. Analysts do not rule out a reduction in the interest rate as early as autumn, if economic activity remains at a reasonable level. However, a sharp slowdown in growth is unlikely, given current budget expenditures and ongoing growth in household income. In this scenario, GDP growth may reach 1.5% this year and 2.2% next year. Additionally, there may be a moderate increase in disposable income, driven by rising interest rates on deposits and reduced demand for loans. However, if external conditions change, such as a relaxation of sanctions or a global economic downturn, the Central Bank may need to take more active measures to ease monetary policy. In this case, the key interest rate may be reduced to 16% at an inflation rate of around 6%. However, budget expenditures must remain within approved parameters to avoid an increase in inflationary pressure. The forecast emphasizes that the Central Bank's actions will depend on how successfully it stabilizes inflation. The regulator will evaluate the effectiveness of its measures to cool the economy, aiming to avoid a recessionary scenario. The Central Bank's macroeconomic block also shares a similar position, forecasting an average interest rate of 19-22% by the end of 2025, with GDP growth of 1-2%. Next year, a more moderate growth of 0.5-1.5% is expected. Other analysts have varying expectations. The company 'Ingosstrakh-Investments' considers the 'Expert RA' forecast to be generally realistic, even allowing for a lower inflation rate of around 5%. In contrast, experts from 'Renaissance Capital' have more cautious estimates, predicting a GDP growth of 1% and inflation of around 8% due to ongoing external economic risks. They also believe that the Central Bank may not rush to ease policy, relying on long-term inflation pressure reduction through economic cooling. The latest macro-survey data from the Central Bank, conducted in April, confirms the trends. Expected inflation in 2025 is 7.1%, the key interest rate is 20%, and economic growth is estimated at 1.6%. The 'shock' scenario for the Russian economy Analysts from 'Expert RA' also consider a less favorable scenario for the Russian economy, which may occur in the event of increased inflationary pressure. The causes of possible acceleration of price growth include the recovery of credit activity, growth of government expenditures, increase in inflationary expectations among the population and business, as well as potential relaxation of sanctions or reduction of global economic uncertainty. In the event of continued internal demand and high economic activity, the Central Bank, in the opinion of analysts, may maintain a tight monetary policy. In this case, the key interest rate may be kept at 21% until the end of the year, leading to a significant slowdown in economic growth. At the same time, a decline in credit impulse and increased pressure on financial markets are expected. However, there may be an increase in savings, and the use of accumulated reserves by households and companies will be delayed. The main contribution to the current level of inflation, according to macroeconomic estimates, is made not by monetary, but by structural and external factors, including restrictions on exports and imports, as well as labor market tension. However, some experts believe that monetary indicators remain stable and do not create critical threats in the short term. Nevertheless, the Central Bank's position differs from this view. Analysts of the regulator, citing data from the end of 2024, point to a significant contribution of monetary factors to inflationary processes. In particular, excessive injection of funds into the economy through credit and budget channels, in their opinion, exceeds the capabilities of the internal market, even taking into account replacement of external loans with internal sources and structural changes in the economy. According to other estimates, inflation may receive an additional impetus in the event of continued fiscal stimulation or weakening of the national currency. However, possible relaxation of the sanctions regime, regardless of the scenario, will exert a restraining effect on inflation.

**PHBS Analytical Center Publishes Macroeconomic Report for Q1 2025**
The PHBS Analytical Center at Peking University HSBC Business School has published a macroeconomic report for the first quarter of 2025, highlighting a strong start to the year for the Chinese economy. In January and February, production volume exceeded expectations, and the overall trade surplus reached a historical maximum for the period. However, consumption and investment grew at a slower pace. The report identifies four key macroeconomic trends for the first quarter: a 5.0% GDP growth forecast for the first half of 2025, potential pressure on exports in the second quarter, and the need for stronger policy support to stimulate consumption. The report also notes that the real estate market is expected to continue its stable recovery, and producers are likely to expand the use of automation and intelligent technologies to reduce costs. The report offers several strategic recommendations, including: increasing support for enterprises going global through vertical specialization, improving the efficiency of fiscal policy to stimulate consumption, issuing at least 700 billion yuan in special land reserve bonds this year, and accelerating fiscal and tax reforms to address the structural unemployment problem caused by scientific and technological progress.

**Russian Economy Reaches 'Point of Inflection': Expert**
The Russian economy has reached a 'point of inflection', according to Anton Tabakh, managing director of macroeconomic analysis and forecasting at the 'Expert RA' agency. The economy is experiencing a slowdown in growth, but no serious threats to budget stability have been identified. Tabakh notes that from this point, two possible scenarios are possible: a soft landing or an unexpected shock. He considers the soft landing scenario to be the most likely, with a probability that has significantly increased over the past three months. This scenario involves reducing inflation to 6.5-7% by the end of the year and lowering the key interest rate to 18-19% by December. The growth of GDP will be controlled, and by 2025, the economy may grow by 1.5%, and by 2026, by 2.2%. The reduction in the key interest rate may begin in September if there are no signs of a more significant slowdown in the economy. The main factors that could lead to a more severe shock scenario are an increase in inflation, excessive optimism, and the preservation of the level of economic activity, as in recent years, Tabakh notes. If these risks materialize, Tabakh predicts a tightening of monetary policy, up to maintaining the rate at 21% by December and virtually zero economic growth. In any case, the analyst expects a sharp decline in annual inflation in April-May. The slowdown in the economy in the coming months will be noticeable in many industries, and the consequences for the budget from a potential drop in prices for Russian raw materials due to trade wars will be limited, Tabakh summarized.

**IMK Inflation Monitor: Household Inflation Rates Show Significant Decrease**
The new Inflation Monitor from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research (IMK) shows that different household types, which vary in income and household size, have similar household-specific inflation rates, ranging from 1.7 to 2.0 percent in March. This is a significant decrease from the 3.1 percentage point range seen during the peak of the inflation wave in autumn 2022. Households with low incomes, which were heavily affected by the acute price surge in 2022 and 2023, had a slightly below-average inflation rate of 1.7 percent in March 2025, according to Dr. Silke Tober, IMK expert for monetary policy and author of the Inflation Monitor. Tober warns that the risk of inflation falling below the target rate of 2 percent is increasing due to the trade conflict provoked by US President Donald Trump, which could lead to a global recession and further dampen price development. Tober recommends further interest rate steps by the ECB, as the monetary policy in the euro area was too restrictive for the weak economic dynamics even before the shocks caused by the erratic US government policy. A rate cut on the upcoming ECB meeting would be 'already expected by the markets', Tober suggests. The central bank should also 'announce further easing of monetary policy', Tober recommends. This would also appropriately flank the investment offensive planned by the Union and SPD in Germany, Tober emphasizes. 'In the current situation, monetary and fiscal policy should create a favorable environment for state and private investments, to counteract the dampening external influences through strong domestic demand.'

**U.S. Economy Shows Resilience Amid Global Uncertainty in Early 2025**
The U.S. economy is showing resilience in early 2025, despite global uncertainty. Recent economic indicators suggest moderate growth, easing inflation, and improved labor market stability. According to economists, the GDP growth for Q1 2025 is projected at 2.1%, with consumer spending remaining robust and the unemployment rate steady at 3.8%. Inflation has cooled, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) now at 3.1% year-over-year. The Federal Reserve remains cautious, maintaining its current interest rate at 5.25%, but markets are pricing in the possibility of a rate cut later in Q3. International trade remains strong, with emerging markets such as India, Vietnam, and Mexico attracting capital inflows. The housing market is showing signs of recovery, with mortgage rates stabilizing around 6.5% and consumer sentiment climbing to its highest level since early 2022. As noted by economists, the U.S. economy is walking a tightrope between maintaining growth and avoiding new inflationary cycles.

**Weekly Data Preview: US and UK GDP and Inflation Data to be Released**
This week's key data preview: US and UK GDP and inflation data will be released in turn. According to preliminary data, the UK's manufacturing industry performed the worst among major countries, dragging down the UK's 1-month GDP performance. The US maintained a positive expansion in both data, but also accompanied by continued pressure. This situation may affect the market trend of foreign exchange, stock index futures, and commodities (such as oil and gold) in the foreign exchange market, and investors need to pay close attention to adjust their trading strategies. On Tuesday, the main data will focus on the US, with the 3-month Consumer Confidence Index if it continues to be below 100, will be considered as a weak performance; another, the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank's manufacturing index ended its long-term decline last month, if it can continue to maintain positive growth, it can alleviate the recent market's weakening economic confidence. Central bank actions: attention to the UK's central bank governor Bailey's speech and the release of the Bank of Japan's foreign exchange policy meeting minutes. On Wednesday, attention will be paid to the UK's release of 2-month CPI, whether the inflation pressure will increase, 1-month data recorded a six-month negative growth, but the year-on-year data unexpectedly recorded the highest in March 2024, the public's expectations for future inflation have risen, making the UK central bank more cautious in monetary policy. The latest data shows that the UK's 1-month GDP unexpectedly contracted, exacerbating market concerns about economic slowdown. In addition, the UK government will release the spring budget statement, which will affect the market's judgment of the economic outlook, and the pound may follow the fluctuations. On Thursday evening, the US will release the fourth-quarter GDP final value, with the previous data showing Q4 actual GDP year-on-year seasonally adjusted value at 2.3%, the same as the initial value. Although the growth rate has slowed down compared to the previous few quarters, it still shows the resilience of the US economy. The latest data is focused on whether there will be a revision, but under the drag of the latest tariffs policy of the Trump government, the market generally expects the US economy to slow down in 2025. On Friday, the UK will release the fourth-quarter GDP year-on-year final value, after recording a negative growth in the latest quarter, the market hopes to see whether there will be an upward revision; at the same time, attention will be paid to the eurozone's 3-month consumer confidence index and economic sentiment index whether there will be a signal of rebound. In the evening, the US will release the 2-month core PCE price index, which is the focus of the market, although the Federal Reserve has already announced its decision last week, but the tariffs policy is still pushing up the inflation expectations, but the recent data shows that the PCE inflation continues to grow relatively mildly, providing support for the Federal Reserve to further lower interest rates, so the latest report will continue to affect the timing of the next interest rate cut. This Friday, ATFX will provide PCE price index report predictions, please pay attention to our latest market news updates.

**UK Economy Unexpectedly Contracts in January 2025**
The UK economy unexpectedly contracted in January 2025, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The economy had grown by 0.4% in December 2024, but fell by 0.1% in January. This unexpected decline is putting pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the traditional Spring Statement. The government's plans to cut spending, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are also contributing to the economic uncertainty. Despite the surprise decline in economic output, ING's market economist James Smith believes that higher government spending will lead to a reasonable growth rate of 1% in 2025. However, he is unsure if this will be enough to prevent difficult decisions for the Treasury. The largest contributor to the decline in production was the manufacturing sector, which fell by 0.9%. Within this sector, manufacturing fell by 1.1%. The decline in manufacturing was due to a decrease in the production of primary metals and metal products, as well as a decline in the production of pharmaceuticals, mining, and quarrying. The construction sector also showed a slight decline of 0.2%, while the services sector showed a small growth of 0.1%. The services sector was the main contributor to the growth of 0.2% in the real GDP from January 2025 to October 2024. The GDP is expected to grow by 1% in January 2025 on a yearly basis. The quarterly GDP growth rate was 1.2% compared to the same period last year. Trade Nation's Senior Market Analyst David Morrison said that the market reaction was quiet, with the pound and the FTSE 100 index experiencing a slight pullback. However, the FTSE 100 index was boosted by the rise in US stock index futures, while the pound fell against the dollar. This is seen as a minor correction after the pound's sharp rise this month. The uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff strategy is also affecting the financial markets. The trade disputes with the US are also a threat to the UK economy, with the country exporting £60.4 billion (€72 billion) worth of goods to the US in 2023. The weak production and rising inflation will also raise more questions for the Bank of England ahead of its next meeting. The base rate of the Bank of England is currently at 4.5%, following three interest rate cuts in August and November last year and in February this year. The next interest rate decision will be announced on March 20.

**Euro Area Macroeconomic Projections for 2025**
The European Central Bank (BCE) has released macroeconomic projections for the euro area, indicating that the persistent high level of geopolitical and policy uncertainty will weigh on economic growth, slowing down the recovery. The uncertainty is expected to impact exports and investment, leading to a decrease in the market share of euro area exports. Despite these adverse factors, the conditions for a new boost to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the euro area remain in place. The rise in real wages and employment, in the context of a strong labor market, is expected to support a recovery where consumption continues to contribute significantly to growth. The internal demand is also expected to be supported by the lower restrictiveness of financing conditions, as implied by market expectations for the future path of interest rates. The labor market is expected to remain resilient, with an average unemployment rate of 6.3% in 2025 and decreasing to 6.2% in 2027. With the beginning of the disappearance of some of the cyclical factors that recently reduced productivity, it is expected that this will recover over the projection horizon, although structural challenges will persist. In general, the average annual real GDP growth is expected to be 0.9% in 2025, increasing to 1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. Compared to the macroeconomic projections of December 2024, the prospects for GDP growth were revised downward by 0.2 percentage points for 2025 and 2026, but remain unchanged for 2027. The inflation rate is expected to moderate in 2025 and then decrease, reaching around 2.0% in 2027, in line with the BCE's inflation target. The inflation rate is expected to be driven by the upward effects of base-year effects in the energy price component and higher food price inflation, which will compensate for the downward effects of a decline in the inflation rate excluding energy and food (HICPX). The upward trend in energy prices is expected to continue in 2025, with a positive annual rate of change in energy prices. Although oil and gas prices are expected to decline in line with futures prices, it is likely that energy price inflation will continue to register positive rates, although below the historical average, throughout the projection horizon. In 2027, energy price inflation is expected to be driven upward by the introduction of new measures to mitigate climate change. Food price inflation is expected to increase until mid-2025, driven by recent robust increases in food commodity prices, and then decrease, reaching an average of 2.2% in 2027. The HICPX is expected to start decreasing in early 2025, with the disappearance of the effects of the delayed price revaluation, the decrease in wage pressures, and the continued transmission of the impact of previous increases in monetary policy restrictiveness to consumer prices. The decrease in HICPX is expected to be driven mainly by a decrease in service price inflation, which has been relatively persistent until now. In general, it is expected that HICPX will moderate, from 2.2% in 2025 to 1.9% in 2027. Wage growth is expected to continue to follow a downward trend from current high levels, as compensation for inflation pressures dissipate. Along with the expected recovery in productivity growth, this is expected to lead to a significantly slower growth in unit labor costs. Consequently, it is expected that internal price pressures will continue to ease, with margins recovering over the projection horizon. External price pressures - reflected in import prices - are expected to remain moderate, assuming that EU trade policies remain unchanged. Compared to the December 2024 projections, the prospects for global inflation measured by HICPX were revised upward by 0.2 percentage points for 2025, due to higher assumptions for energy commodity prices and euro depreciation, and were subject to a slight downward revision for 2027, due to slightly weaker prospects for the energy price component at the end of the horizon.

**Schroeder Economics Team Releases Macroeconomic Forecast for 2025**
Schroeder Economics Team has released a macroeconomic forecast for 2025 (January-March). The team maintains a positive view of the US economy, expecting 2.5% growth in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026. However, they also expect inflation to rise, with the core consumer price index (CPI) increasing by 3% in 2025 and 2026. The Federal Reserve may pause interest rate cuts for several months to assess the impact of the Trump administration's policies, and may resume rate hikes in 2026. In contrast, the Eurozone economy is expected to improve, driven by a decrease in political uncertainty and the effects of monetary easing. However, inflation remains a concern, and the European Central Bank may implement additional interest rate cuts, bringing the Eurozone central bank deposit rate to 2.25% by the end of 2025. The UK economy is expected to face supply-side constraints, leading to stagflationary pressures, with inflation expected to exceed 3% in the second half of 2025 and remain above the 2% target for the next two years. The Bank of England may implement limited monetary easing, with a 25bps rate cut in May, bringing the policy rate to 4.25%. In emerging markets, China is expected to continue to face pessimistic prospects, with a slowdown in economic growth in the first half of 2025. In contrast, India is expected to see a positive outlook, with economic growth accelerating from the middle of 2025. Brazil, on the other hand, is expected to see a slowdown in economic growth due to aggressive interest rate hikes and rising inflation.

**Economic and Strategy Viewpoint – Q1 2025**
Schroders' latest macroeconomic outlook for Q1 2025 predicts a moderate global growth of 2.5% in 2025, accelerating to 2.8% in 2026. The United States is expected to maintain a GDP growth of 2.5% due to strong consumer spending, but inflation remains elevated at around 3%. The Federal Reserve may resume rate hikes in 2026. The Eurozone and UK are expected to experience modest growth, but persistent inflation will limit rate cuts by the ECB and BoE.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **ONS GDP Time Series (ons.gov.uk)**: An index page of UK GDP data visualizations dating back to 1270. As the UK's official statistical authority, the ONS provides high-quality primary data, though the summary lacks recent specific figures.

2. **Our World in Data GDP Catalog**: A collection of UK GDP series from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) with the most recent update from March 28, 2025. This represents factual data compilation from a reputable research organization.

3. **Trading Economics/ONS GDP Summary**: Presents Q4 2024 GDP growth (+0.1% quarter-on-quarter) with sectoral breakdowns (services +0.1%, construction +0.3%, production -0.4%). This factual reporting of official statistics provides recent UK economic performance.

4. **NerdWallet GDP Report (April 7, 2025)**: Focuses on US GDP performance (+2.4% in Q4 2024, +2.8% for 2024 overall). Though less directly relevant to UK forecasting, it provides global context from a secondary source reporting official BEA data.

5. **Reuters China GDP Report (April 16, 2025)**: Reports China's Q1 2025 growth at 5.4%, beating expectations. This highly current information from a reputable news agency provides context on global economic conditions.

6. **BBC News UK Economy Article (April 11, 2025)**: Reports 0.5% UK growth in February 2025 and notes the Bank of England reduced its 2025 growth forecast from 1.5% to 0.75% in February 2025. The Office for Budget Responsibility halved its 2025 forecast to 1% on March 26. These official forecasts from authoritative UK institutions are highly relevant.

7. **Perplexity Report on UK Q2 GDP Trends**: Comprehensive analysis of historical Q2 GDP patterns (2008-2023), noting Q2 growth exceeding 2% is rare in modern UK history, with the strongest recent Q2 being 4.8% in 2021 (post-COVID rebound). Contains factual data with some analytical interpretation.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several potential reference classes emerge:

1. **All Historical UK Q2 GDP Growth**: Provides largest sample size and Q2-specific patterns but includes very different economic conditions.

2. **Post-Financial Crisis Q2 Growth (2010-2019)**: More recent economic structures while excluding extreme outliers like 2008-2009 and 2020.

3. **Post-COVID Q2 Growth (2021-2024)**: Most similar to current conditions but limited sample size includes unusual rebound effects.

4. **Recent UK Quarterly Growth (All Quarters, 2023-2025)**: Captures current economic conditions but misses Q2-specific patterns.

5. **Current Institutional Forecasts**: Incorporates professional analysis but forecasts have shown systematic biases.

The most suitable reference class combines #2 and #4 - using post-financial crisis Q2 growth for structural patterns while giving more weight to very recent quarterly growth across all quarters. The Perplexity report confirms Q2 growth rarely exceeds 2% in modern UK economic history.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Our forecast targets Q2 2025 (April-June), with today being April 19, 2025. The outcome will be known when the ONS publishes its first estimate around August 14, 2025 (approximately 4 months from now).

Recent quarterly growth patterns show:
- Q4 2024: +0.1% 
- Q3 2024: 0%
- Q2 2024: +0.6%
- Q1 2024: +0.7%

Monthly data shows +0.5% growth in February 2025, suggesting Q1 2025 might show positive growth.

The Bank of England forecasts 0.75% growth for 2025 (roughly 0.2% quarterly if evenly distributed), while the OBR projects 1% (roughly 0.25% quarterly).

Recent Q2-specific growth:
- 2023 Q2: 0.2%
- 2024 Q2: 0.6%

## (d) Justification

Based on the analysis above, my outside view prediction is informed by:

1. Recent UK quarterly GDP growth shows modest but generally positive momentum (+0.1% in Q4 2024, 0% in Q3 2024, +0.6% in Q2 2024, +0.7% in Q1 2024).

2. Official forecasts from the Bank of England (0.75%) and OBR (1%) suggest continued modest growth for 2025, translating to approximately 0.2-0.25% per quarter.

3. Historical Q2 growth rates in 2023-2024 have remained in the 0.2-0.6% range, and the Perplexity report confirms that Q2 growth exceeding 2% is rare.

4. Global economic indicators show mixed signals - solid US growth (2.4% in Q4 2024) and strong Chinese performance (5.4% in Q1 2025), but concerns about US-China trade tensions could affect global trade.

5. The BBC article highlights economic headwinds including higher inflation, rising costs (national insurance, energy/water bills), and potential US trade tariffs that could constrain growth.

The evidence strongly points to continued modest positive growth in Q2 2025, most likely in the 0-1% range, with lower probabilities for higher growth or contraction.

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I must consider:

1. The historical distribution shows Q2 growth typically concentrates in the 0-1% range in recent years (0.2% in 2023 Q2, 0.6% in 2024 Q2). The post-COVID rebound of 4.8% in 2021 Q2 represents an outlier rather than a likely pattern.

2. Official forecasts from the Bank of England and OBR suggest quarterly growth around 0.2-0.25% - firmly in the "Up 0.0% to 1.0%" bracket.

3. The Perplexity report notes Bank of England forecasts had a 0.4pp average overestimation in 2010-2019, suggesting some downside risk. However, IMF forecasts showed "excessive pessimism" for 2023, indicating potential for upside surprises.

4. The rate of unexpected economic outcomes has increased in recent years due to compounding crises (Brexit, pandemic, inflation). This uncertainty suggests I should allocate non-trivial probabilities to outcomes beyond the central forecast.

Given these factors, I'll allocate the highest probability to "Up 0.0% to 1.0%" as the most likely outcome, with declining probabilities in both directions. The very strong growth scenarios (above 2%) remain historically rare and should receive correspondingly low probabilities.

# Outside View Prediction:
Down >1.0%: 7%
Down 0.0% to 1.0%: 15%
Up 0.0% to 1.0%: 53%
Up 1.0% to 2.0%: 19%
Up 2.0% to 3.0%: 5%
Up >3.0%: 1%

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:
1. **ONS GDP Time Series Summary**: This appears to be metadata about available GDP series rather than actual data. Quality is likely high as ONS is the official UK statistics agency, but limited content makes it minimally useful. Date appears recent (March 2025).

2. **Our World in Data GDP Summary**: Another catalog of available data series without specific recent values. Academic source likely reliable but not providing actionable recent data. Updated through early 2025.

3. **UK GDP via Trading Economics**: Comprehensive compilation of ONS data with sector breakdowns. High quality (official data) and recent (includes Q4 2024). Key facts: Q4 2024 GDP grew 0.1% quarter-on-quarter (following flat Q3), with services +0.1%, construction +0.3%, production -0.4%.

4. **NerdWallet US GDP Article**: Contains US economic data from April 7, 2025. Medium quality but irrelevant geography for UK forecast.

5. **Reuters/SCMP China GDP Article**: Details China's Q1 2025 growth (5.4% year-on-year, 1.2% quarter-on-quarter). High quality but limited UK relevance. Very recent (April 16, 2025).

6. **BBC News Article (via SCMP)**: Contains recent UK economic data (April 11, 2025). High quality using official figures. Key facts: UK economy grew 0.5% in February 2025; 2024 quarterly growth was +0.7% (Q1), +0.5% (Q2), 0% (Q3), slight uptick in Q4; Bank of England cut its 2025 growth forecast from 1.5% to 0.75% in February 2025; Office for Budget Responsibility reduced its 2025 forecast to 1% in March 2025.

7. **Perplexity Report**: Detailed analysis of UK GDP trends (2008-2023). Medium quality (AI-generated) but contains factual historical data. Key insights: Q2 growth rarely exceeds 2% in recent UK history; Q2 2024 growth was 0.6%; structural constraints limit growth potential.

## Reference Class Analysis:
1. **Recent UK Quarterly Growth (2023-2025)**: Most relevant reference class showing modest growth trajectory (Q1 2024: +0.7%, Q2 2024: +0.5/0.6%, Q3 2024: 0%, Q4 2024: +0.1%, Feb 2025: +0.5%).

2. **Historical Q2 Patterns**: From Perplexity report, Q2 growth rarely exceeds 2% in modern UK economic history (Q2 2023: +0.2%, Q2 2024: +0.6%).

3. **Official 2025 Forecasts**: Bank of England (0.75%) and Office for Budget Responsibility (1%) both revised downward recently.

The most suitable reference class combines recent quarterly performance with historical Q2 patterns, as these directly relate to the prediction timeframe and seasonal patterns.

## Timeframe Analysis:
Q2 2025 begins in approximately 10 days from today (April 19, 2025) and runs through June 2025. The most recent data shows modest growth (0.1% in Q4 2024, 0.5% in February 2025). While quarterly growth fluctuated throughout 2024, it has generally stayed in the 0-1% range.

Historical Q2 performance specifically shows growth of 0.2% (2023) and 0.6% (2024), suggesting Q2 tends to deliver modest positive growth. The timeframe is sufficiently short that current momentum likely carries significant weight.

## Justification:
The preponderance of evidence points to continued modest growth in Q2 2025:

1. Recent quarterly GDP growth shows positive but slowing momentum (0.1% in Q4 2024, 0.5% in February 2025).

2. Services (79% of UK GDP) grew 0.1% in Q4 2024, suggesting continued modest expansion in the dominant sector.

3. Official forecasts for 2025 have been revised downward but remain positive (0.75-1%).

4. Historical Q2 performance shows consistent modest growth (0.2-0.6% range).

5. Structural constraints identified in the Perplexity report (productivity stagnation, investment drought, trade disruptions) suggest limited growth potential.

# Outside view calibration:
The evidence strongly suggests growth in the 0-1% range is most likely. Recent quarterly patterns, historical Q2 performance, and official forecasts all align with this assessment.

While recent growth has been positive, there are meaningful downside risks (global trade tensions, inflation pressures) that could produce flat or negative growth. The February 2025 figure (0.5%) suggests some upside potential, but exceeding 2% appears unlikely given recent history.

Economic forecasts have had significant errors in recent years due to unprecedented events. While centering my distribution on the most likely outcome (0-1% growth), I should assign meaningful probability to adjacent categories and some probability to tail outcomes to account for forecast uncertainty.

# Outside View Prediction:
Down >1.0%: 5%
Down 0.0% to 1.0%: 18%
Up 0.0% to 1.0%: 47%
Up 1.0% to 2.0%: 21%
Up 2.0% to 3.0%: 7%
Up >3.0%: 2%

  – Recaps the composition of GDP (services ~79%, industry ~21%) and the official Q4 2024 growth estimates.  
  – Generally factual, though Tradingeconomics often includes summarized commentary.  
  – Reliance on official ONS releases is solid. Potential interpretive slant in wording (e.g., describing “drags” on growth) is mostly explanatory.

• “https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/gdp-report”  
  – U.S. GDP summary, referencing U.S. BEA data, with timing for Q1 2025 estimates.  
  – Factual data about U.S. growth, personal income, inflation measures.  
  – Not directly UK-focused, but some macro signals may indirectly inform a UK outlook (e.g., if U.S. growth trends are exceptionally strong or weak, they can spill over).

• “https://www.reuters.com/world/china/...” (South China Morning Post article on China’s Q1 2025 growth)  
  – Indicates China’s economy grew ~5.4% yoy in Q1 2025, beating forecasts.  
  – Factual numbers come from China’s NBS, though official Chinese data can be subject to skepticism.  
  – The commentary about U.S.–China trade tensions is relevant to the global trade environment but not a direct predictor of UK Q2 2025 growth.

• “https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/...” (BBC News article, 11 April 2025, about the UK economy)  
  – Summaries of monthly GDP growth, the Bank of England’s forecasts, and OBR updates through 2024 and early 2025.  
  – BBC typically is a reputable news source, though it can include interpretive narratives. The underlying data generally come from ONS or the Bank of England.

• Perplexity_report  
  – Presents an analysis of Q2 UK GDP growth trends from 2008–2023, referencing multiple historical episodes: 2008–09 financial crisis, Brexit period, COVID-19 downturn, etc.  
  – It includes factual citations (some referencing the ONS, BoE, IMF), but also interpretive paragraphs on structural productivity issues, trade shifts, and forecast comparisons.  
  – The discussion attempts to separate the crises’ direct impacts from structural trends. Where it offers numeric data (e.g., “-19.8% in Q2 2020”), that is presumably from ONS’s official releases. Opinions about “low-growth traps” or “Brexit impacts” are more interpretive and should be weighed cautiously—some are from OBR or Bank of England experts; others appear as the author’s interpretation.

Across these sources:
• Government agencies (ONS, NBS) are typically strong on factual data but can be subject to subsequent revision.  
• Breaking-news outlets or aggregator websites (BBC, Reuters, Tradingeconomics, Nerdwallet) generally summarize official data plus commentary; their “opinions” can vary by reporter or editorial stance.  
• When attributing opinions, I weigh recognized institutional forecasts (BoE, IMF, OBR) more heavily than general commentary.

(2) Reference Class Analysis  
For the question “What will be the UK real GDP growth rate for Q2 2025?” possible reference classes could be:  
  • (a) UK Q2 quarter-on-quarter growth data from the last 15 years (post-2008 crisis).  
  • (b) UK quarterly real GDP growth for all quarters (pooled) from ~2010 onward, excluding outliers like the extreme COVID-19 contraction and rebound.  
  • (c) Recent Q2 expansions in advanced European economies under moderate growth conditions (excluding crisis quarters).

(a) and (b) both offer direct UK historical precedents.  
– Q2 and Q1 can sometimes show seasonal idiosyncrasies. Focusing specifically on Q2 might highlight repeated patterns (e.g., 2020’s extreme drop, 2021’s strong rebound). However, unusual events (COVID lockdown or reopening) skew the distribution.  
– Option (b) pools multiple quarters. This might water down Q2’s seasonal element but includes more examples of both expansions and recessions.

The most suitable single reference class could be (a) specifically Q2 data from ~2010 onward, while carefully adjusting for the COVID-19 outlier. Historically, the UK rarely exceeds 2% quarter-on-quarter growth in normal conditions.

(3) Timeframe Analysis  
• Today’s date is 19 April 2025. Q2 2025 runs from April to June 2025; the ONS “first quarterly estimate” for Q2 2025 is due ~14 August 2025.  
• That leaves roughly 2 to 3 months of actual economic performance plus a bit more time until the data release.  
• Historically, over the last 10–15 years, quarter-on-quarter expansions above +2% in the UK are rare outside extraordinary rebounds (e.g., COVID re-openings). Likewise, contractions of more than 1% without a major shock are also uncommon outside crisis periods.

(4) Justification  
Considering the outside view:  
• The baseline from historical Q2 expansions is subdued, typically in a band between slightly negative (e.g., -0.5%) and about +1% or +1.5%.  
• Since Q4 2024 was +0.1% growth, the economy showed sluggish but still-positive momentum.  
• External environments (e.g., modest growth in the U.S., ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China, persistent inflation in advanced economies) do not strongly suggest either a robust above +3% surge or a greater than -1% recession shock.  
• A small chance remains for a negative surprise (fresh financial instability or sudden rate hikes), but the base case leans to mild positive.  

Hence, purely from an outside perspective—looking at typical Q2 results, absent an acute crisis—the “Up 0.0% to 1.0%” and “Up 1.0% to 2.0%” brackets hold much of the probability. Relatively smaller probabilities extend to both unexpected downside (< -1.0%) or a surprisingly strong expansion (> 3.0%).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside view calibration:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) My aim is to estimate a true likelihood, not to hedge artificially.  
(b) Historically, quarter-on-quarter growth in the UK at or above +3% is very rare outside extraordinary rebounds. Similarly, a contraction beyond -1% typically reflects a major crisis.  
(c) Small percentage shifts matter for GDP: 2% vs. 3% means a very different scale of expansion.  
(d) Over the last 10–15 years, unexpected shocks do happen—witness 2020–2021—but typically not frequently. A moderate upset probability should remain in each tail (strong negative or strong positive).

Given those considerations, I will distribute probabilities across the six outcomes to reflect that a modestly positive growth figure is the most common “outside view” scenario, while extremes are possible but less likely.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside View Prediction:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Down >1.0%: 6%  
Down 0.0% to 1.0%: 18%  
Up 0.0% to 1.0%: 38%  
Up 1.0% to 2.0%: 23%  
Up 2.0% to 3.0%: 10%  
Up >3.0%: 5%

Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis

• “Historical context” from ONS (multiple pages) and Our World in Data (GDP time‐series index).  
  – Mostly factual historical data on GDP levels, growth rates, sector shares.  
  – Commentary is minimal; these sources are official or well‐established aggregators (ONS, Our World in Data). They are high‐quality for historical facts, though do not directly project future GDP.

• Tradingeconomics summary (UK Q4 2024 official estimates).  
  – Provides official ONS data for Q4 2024 and earlier quarters, with quarter‐on‐quarter breakdowns.  
  – The text is descriptive, factual (ONS data). Forecasting commentary is not really present beyond one‐quarter horizon.

• NerdWallet summary (focus on U.S. GDP to Q4 2024).  
  – Factual references to BEA data and Federal Reserve commentary. Useful as background on global context, but less direct for UK’s Q2 2025.  
  – Opinions are from Fed Chair Powell and FOMC projections. Those are from an identifiable central bank source, so they carry weight for U.S. data, though only indirectly relevant for the UK.

• Reuters/SCMP summary (China’s Q1 2025 GDP).  
  – Factual data from China’s NBS.  
  – Commentary cautioning “complex external environment.” Possibly relevant only as global context.

• BBC News article (April 2025).  
  – Summarizes monthly UK GDP trends for early 2025.  
  – Cites Bank of England and OBR forecasts for 2025. Those are from identifiable, reputable institutions (the BoE and OBR).  
  – The text includes both factual data (ONS monthly GDP) and some interpretive commentary (e.g. the BoE’s reasons for lowering forecasts). These are expert/official analyses rather than mere opinion.

• Perplexity_report  
  – A synthetic analysis that merges many datapoints from 2008–2024.  
  – Contains both facts (various historical Q2 results) and interpretive commentary about structural constraints. Some references to recognized sources (ONS, BoE).  
  – Because it is an AI/LLM compilation, I would treat the citations carefully, but many points align with known historical patterns (financial crisis, Brexit, COVID shock). It usefully highlights that Q2 expansions exceeding 2% quarter‐on‐quarter are historically quite rare in the UK.  

Conclusion on source quality:  
• The official ONS and Bank of England materials, plus recognized economic data aggregates (Tradingeconomics, BBC, Our World in Data) are the strongest factual platforms.  
• Commentary from central banks, the OBR, or IMF is well‐attributed expert opinion.  
• The rest (especially model‐aggregated or media commentary) is secondary but helpful background.

(b) Reference Class Analysis

• Reference Class 1: “Recent UK quarterly growth rates post‐COVID (2021–2024).”  
  – Q2 results from this era show relatively weak short‐term expansions (often +0.0% to +0.5% quarter‐on‐quarter).  
  – Suitability: Moderately good, as it reflects the UK’s post‐pandemic environment, including supply disruptions and potential Brexit impacts.

• Reference Class 2: “Longer‐term historical Q2 expansions (e.g., 2000–2019).”  
  – Typically, in stable times, the UK’s quarter‐on‐quarter growth rate for any quarter frequently fell between +0.2% and +0.7%. Sustained rates above +1% were uncommon.  
  – Suitability: Good for “normal times,” but less so if 2025 is not ‘normal’ (given inflation or trade tensions).

• Reference Class 3: “Forecast distributions from major institutions for 2025.”  
  – The Bank of England’s 2025 full‐year forecast is near +0.75% overall, and the OBR near +1%. That is annual, not specifically Q2, but suggests subdued growth.  
  – Suitability: A forward‐looking reference, but single‐year average may obscure quarter‐by‐quarter variation.

Chosen Reference Class  
I will primarily use post‐pandemic UK quarterly growth rates (Reference Class 1), cross‐checked with the Bank of England/OBR annual forecasts (Reference Class 3). The longer‐term “normal times” pattern (Reference Class 2) provides additional context that +1% or higher quarter‐on‐quarter expansions are possible but not frequent.

(c) Timeframe Analysis

• Today is 19 April 2025; Q2 2025 covers April–June.  
• We will know the outcome by the first official ONS quarterly estimate scheduled for 14 August 2025 (about 4 months from now).  
• Historically, quarter‐on‐quarter UK GDP expansions above +1.0% have been uncommon outside a sharp rebound from a slump (e.g., post‐lockdown). In the last pre‐pandemic decade (2010–2019), typical quarter‐on‐quarter growth was around +0.3%–0.6%.  
• Given the mild expansions in Q4 2024 (+0.1%) and the possibility of continued weak external demand in 2025, a “small positive” or borderline zero growth in Q2 2025 seems most probable.

(d) Justification

1. The UK economy has been flirting with near‐zero growth for multiple quarters (Q3 2024 at 0.0%, Q4 2024 at +0.1%).  
2. Official forecasts for 2025 (BoE ~0.75%, OBR ~1.0% annual) imply modest underlying growth. That translates to quarter‐on‐quarter expansions mostly in a +0.1% to +0.3% range.  
3. Notable policy tightening and global headwinds (especially in Europe and the U.S.) reduce the likelihood of a sudden surge. Meanwhile, there is no strong sign of a large negative shock that would push GDP down more than –1%.  
4. Historically, big quarter‐on‐quarter expansions above +2% or large contractions below –1% generally coincide with extraordinary events (e.g., COVID lockdown or reopening). That does not appear in the baseline for Q2 2025.  
5. Therefore, from an “outside view,” the bulk of probability sits near slight contraction (–1% to 0%) or slight growth (0% to +1%), with diminishing probabilities for the more extreme categories at either tail.

Outside view calibration:

• Objective: Estimate the “true” likelihood of each category, aware that Q2 bigger surges or plunges happen infrequently outside crises.  
• Previously established distribution: In normal or moderately subdued economic conditions, the UK’s quarter‐on‐quarter GDP is often in the –0.5% to +0.5% region. A somewhat wider bracket (–1% to +1%) captures most routine volatility.  
• Upsets can occur: Unexpected factors (trade disruptions, global shocks) occasionally produce negative readings or a spike from restocking or policy. But the neutral stance of forecasts suggests only a small chance for extremes.  
• Probability spread: The best “anchor” is that a moderate positive figure near +0.2–0.5% is typical in stable conditions. Hence I place a clear majority in the “Up 0.0% to 1.0%” bin, with a meaningful minority chance of a mild recession, and small tail probabilities for more extreme expansions or contractions.

Outside View Prediction:

'Down >1.0%'         :  5%  
'Down 0.0% to 1.0%'  : 20%  
'Up 0.0% to 1.0%'    : 55%  
'Up 1.0% to 2.0%'    : 15%  
'Up 2.0% to 3.0%'    :  3%  
'Up >3.0%'           :  2%

Analysis:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Source Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a brief summary of each source, with an emphasis on discerning factual information versus more opinion‐based commentary. I have noted whether the source (a) simply presents data, (b) includes recognized institutional or expert viewpoints, or (c) contains commentary whose authority may be unclear.

• “Disclaimer: This appears to be an index page of interactive charts…”  
  – Factual scope: This page mainly displays historical UK GDP and related statistics from varied academic and international sources.  
  – Opinions: Minimal to none. The text references broad historical data, so it is mostly factual.  

• “Disclaimer: This appears to be a catalog of UK GDP series available on FRED…”  
  – Factual scope: A listing of multiple time series capturing different ways of measuring UK GDP (nominal, real, seasonally adjusted, etc.).  
  – Opinions: None presented.  

• “Summary of ‘United Kingdom GDP Growth Rate,’ Tradingeconomics…”  
  – Factual scope: Observed quarter‐on‐quarter growth rates for Q3–Q4 2024, breakouts by sector (services, construction, production, etc.), household consumption, government spending, and net trade.  
  – Opinions: Tradingeconomics commentary occasionally includes short “analyst expectations.” These are not purely raw data but remain widely cited.  

• “Key takeaways from the NerdWallet article ‘GDP Report: Final Estimate Shows Growth Increased 2.4% in Q4 2024’…”  
  – Factual scope: U.S. figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, plus commentary on Federal Reserve policy from official channels.  
  – Opinions: NerdWallet offers consumer‐friendly explanations that blend facts (GDP growth, PCE inflation) with editorial style. The explicit remarks from Powell or the Federal Reserve are expert opinions, suitable for consideration as official guidance on the U.S. perspective.  

• “Key points from the SCMP article ‘China’s economy grows 5.4%…’”  
  – Factual scope: Q1 2025 official GDP data from China.  
  – Opinions: Official remarks by China’s NBS leadership (e.g., “innovation is playing a leading role”) reflect government commentary but recognize that further complexities (trade tensions) remain.  

• “Concise summary of the BBC News article (11 April 2025)…”  
  – Factual scope: Monthly UK GDP data from the ONS (e.g., +0.5% in February 2025); references to official forecasts (Bank of England’s 2025 growth forecast at 0.75–1.5%) and the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast at 1%.  
  – Opinions: The BBC typically offers a combination of facts from the ONS plus commentary from economists. The numerical forecasts from the BoE or OBR can be considered expert opinions with recognized credibility.  

• “Perplexity_report” (the long discussion of UK Q2 growth trends 2008–2023, with references to multiple crises)…  
  – Factual scope: A synthesized historical timeline since 2008, referencing widely known major events (Global Financial Crisis, Brexit, COVID‐19). Cites approximate growth rates and draws from multiple recognized data sources.  
  – Opinions: There is some interpretive commentary (e.g., “structural constraints,” “low‐growth trap,” “8.4% increase in Commonwealth trade offset by 12.7% EU decrease,” etc.). The narrative about “structural weaknesses” is partly factual (trends in labor productivity, public data from ONS) but also includes opinion (e.g., the label “low‐growth trap”)—this is not official ONS language.  

In short, most sources provide data from official offices (ONS, BEA, Bank of England, etc.), so the factual core is robust. Forecasts from the Bank of England (including interest rate commentary) and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) can be viewed as expert opinions with institutional credibility. Where articles use interpretative language or present forward‐looking judgments in “analyst notes,” I treat those as non‐official commentary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Reference Class Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For forecasting the UK’s Q2 2025 real GDP growth, I can identify multiple potential reference classes:

• (A) Post‐2000 Q2 growth data for the UK: This focuses specifically on second‐quarter real GDP growth (quarterly or year‐on‐year) over the last two decades, spanning events like the 2008 crisis, the Brexit referendum, and COVID‐19 disruptions. This provides an empirical distribution of Q2 outcomes in varying economic climates.

• (B) All quarterly GDP growth data (not Q2‐specific) since 2000: Broadens the time series but blends Q2 with Q1, Q3, Q4, which can mask some seasonal or structural patterns relevant to Q2.

• (C) Similar advanced‐economy expansions during times of moderate growth and slightly elevated inflation: Could consider the broader environment (e.g., the euro area or G7 countries in 2023–2025). But cross‐country differences (fiscal policy, Brexit impacts) might limit direct comparability.

Given the question is specifically about Q2 in the UK, a Q2‐specific historical “outside view” is more precise (Reference Class A). However, since the data on Q2 alone can be sparse year by year, it is also helpful to cross‐check with the general UK quarterly growth pattern (Reference Class B). For an outside view baseline, looking at two decades of second‐quarter expansions is likely suitable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Timeframe Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Today is 2025‐04‐19. We want Q2 2025 growth, which runs April–June. That data will be released in mid‐August 2025. That is roughly four months from now until the “first official ONS release.”

• Historically, Q2 expansions in the UK rarely soared above +2.0% quarter‐on‐quarter. Year‐on‐year changes above +3.0% in Q2 have happened after very deep downturns (e.g., 2021’s rebound from the pandemic). But absent a major rebound scenario, typical second‐quarter yoy growth tends to cluster between +0% and +2%.

• Short‐term signals as of April 2025: The Bank of England’s official forecast for 2025 is in the ~0.75–1% growth band (lowered from earlier ~1.5% estimates). Lingering high energy costs, structural investment weakness, and possibly subdued net trade weigh on growth prospects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Justification
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
– Historical Growth Norms: Over the last 15 years, outside of immediate post‐COVID rebounds, the UK’s Q2 yoy growth rate often falls within a modest range (0–2%).  
– Post‐2024 Trends: Data for Q4 2024 indicated a very slight positive qoq growth of +0.1%. The services sector was still growing, albeit slowly, with manufacturing and production subdued. That suggests a subdued baseline.  
– Institutional Forecasts: The Bank of England, Office for Budget Responsibility, and private analysts typically converge around ~0.5%–1.5% yoy for 2025. While these are projections/“opinions,” they come from recognized agencies, so they influence my outside‐view anchor.  
– Downside Risk: Potential negative growth risks could stem from intensifying inflation or trade disruptions. However, absent a severe recession trigger, a dramatic contraction beyond –1.0% yoy seems less likely.  
– Upside Risk: Achieving +3% yoy in Q2 2025 might require massive expansions in global trade or post‐Brexit clarity. Given no current signals of a surging economy, that scenario appears comparatively low‐probability.

Hence, the outside view strongly points toward mild positive growth, likely in the 0–2% yoy band.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside view calibration:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Historically, “surprise” negative prints (less than –1%) happen during major shocks (2008 meltdown, 2020 COVID). We have no immediate indication of such a shock in mid‐2025, so while not impossible, it is relatively low‐probability.  
• Similarly, “Up >3.0%” yoy expansions generally require a strong rebound from a prior sharp contraction, or an economic boom. No evidence suggests a new boom is underway. This scenario remains possible but unlikely.  
• Most forecasters place 2025 growth in the modest range around 1%. Splitting that range across the resolution bins implies focusing the highest probabilities around either “Up 0.0% to 1.0%” or “Up 1.0% to 2.0%.”

I factor in a small possibility of mild contraction (especially if the next few months see consumer spending weaken sharply) but not strongly. I also allow a small tail for strong growth above 2%. The distribution below sums to 100%.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside View Prediction:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Down >1.0%: 5%  
Down 0.0% to 1.0%: 10%  
Up 0.0% to 1.0%: 35%  
Up 1.0% to 2.0%: 35%  
Up 2.0% to 3.0%: 10%  
Up >3.0%: 5%  
Forecaster 1 step 2 output: # Analysis: UK Real GDP Growth Rate for Q2 2025

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **BBC News (April 11, 2025)**: High-credibility source reporting official ONS data showing 0.5% monthly GDP growth in February 2025. Reports Bank of England lowered its 2025 growth forecast to 0.75% (from 1.5%) in February 2025 due to headwinds including higher inflation, wage costs, and potential US trade tariffs. The Office for Budget Responsibility halved its 2025 growth forecast to 1.0% on March 26, 2025.

2. **CNBC (April 11, 2025)**: Reliable financial news source confirming February's 0.5% GDP growth exceeded expectations (vs 0.1% forecast). Reports production output jumped 1.5% and construction grew 0.4% in February after contractions in January. Suren Thiru (Economics Director, ICAEW) warns potential 10% US tariffs on UK exports will likely override the strong February data when BoE considers rate cuts.

3. **Vanguard Economic Outlook (recent)**: Major investment firm reporting they've "modestly reduced" UK GDP forecast for end-2025 due to tariff announcements. Expected tariff rate on UK goods to rise from 2% to 7%. Projects unemployment to rise from current 4.4% to 4.8% by year-end 2025.

4. **House of Commons Library (March 28, 2025)**: Official UK government research service reporting Q4 2024 GDP at +0.1% (Q3 was 0.0%). Cites OECD forecast (March 17, 2025) lowering UK 2025 growth from 1.7% to 1.4%, and IMF forecast (January 17, 2025) raising 2025 growth from 1.5% to 1.6%.

5. **Al Araby Articles (April 19, 2025)**: Recent reporting citing Oxford Economics' reduced growth forecasts for UK (1% in 2025, down from previous 1.5%). Andrew Goodwin (Oxford Economics) suggests accelerating interest rate reductions may be justified given tariff impacts. Reports 3/4 of UK exports to US now subject to 10% tariff.

6. **Other Sources**: Additional articles on global economic conditions, with less UK-specific content. Qatar National Bank expects US slowdown to 1.4% growth in 2025.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
- **Recent GDP Trajectory**: Official ONS data shows Q4 2024 at +0.1%, with February 2025 at +0.5% and January revised from -0.1% to flat growth. This indicates modest but improving growth momentum entering Q1 2025. (BBC, CNBC)

- **Convergent Official Forecasts**: Multiple authoritative institutions have recently revised 2025 UK growth forecasts downward: BoE (0.75%), OBR (1.0%), Oxford Economics (1%), OECD (1.4%). This consensus around modest 2025 growth translates to approximately 0.2-0.25% quarterly growth if evenly distributed. (BBC, House of Commons, Al Araby)

- **US Tariff Impact**: Multiple sources confirm implementation of 10% US tariffs affecting approximately 3/4 of UK exports to the US. With the US accounting for 17% of UK trade, this represents a significant structural headwind not fully reflected in earlier forecasts. (Vanguard, CNBC, Al Araby)

### Moderate Evidence
- **Production Sector Recovery**: February data showed strong production output growth (+1.5%) after January's contraction (-0.5%), suggesting potential recovery in this key sector. (CNBC)

- **Monetary Policy Trajectory**: Markets pricing in a 25bp BoE rate cut in May (to 4.25%), with Vanguard projecting quarterly cuts to 3.75% by end-2025. Rate cuts typically support growth but operate with lags of 6-18 months. (CNBC, Vanguard)

- **Cost Pressures**: Rising employer National Insurance contributions (from 13.8% to 15% of wages in April), along with higher energy bills and persistent inflation, create additional headwinds for business activity. (BBC, Vanguard)

### Weak Evidence
- **Global Economic Context**: Mixed signals with US growth at 2.4% in Q4 2024 (though QNB expects 2025 slowdown to 1.4%), and strong Chinese growth of 5.4% in Q1 2025. These factors influence UK's trade position but have uncertain Q2 impact. (House of Commons, QNB)

- **Currency Movements**: CNBC reports the pound strengthened 0.6% versus dollar to $1.3047 on April 11, which could affect export competitiveness but has unclear direct Q2 growth effects. (CNBC)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

This forecast targets Q2 2025 (April-June), with resolution expected in mid-August 2025 when ONS publishes its first estimate. Today is April 19, 2025, meaning:

- We're already at the start of the relevant quarter
- We have February 2025 data but not yet complete Q1 results
- The outcome will be determined in approximately 4 months

If the timeframe were halved (forecast only for April-May), I would expect less variance - reducing the probability of extreme outcomes as there would be less time for significant economic shifts. The central estimate would likely remain similar.

If the timeframe were doubled (April-September), I would increase the variance somewhat, with slightly higher probabilities for both stronger growth (more time for interest rate cuts to stimulate economy) and deeper contraction (more time for tariff impacts to affect economic activity).

## (d) Justification

The outside view analysis provides a solid foundation, but current evidence suggests several adjustments:

1. **Trade Tariff Impact Underestimated**: The implementation of 10% US tariffs on 3/4 of UK exports to the US represents a significant headwind only recently implemented. With the US accounting for 17% of UK trade, this creates meaningful drag not fully captured in historical reference classes. This shifts probability toward the "Down 0.0% to 1.0%" bucket and reduces likelihood of high growth scenarios.

2. **Recent Growth Momentum**: The 0.5% February growth and January revision from -0.1% to flat suggest Q1 2025 could show positive growth of perhaps 0.3-0.5%. This momentum would partially carry into Q2, supporting the central "Up 0.0% to 1.0%" bucket.

3. **Production Sector Recovery**: The strong February production growth (+1.5%) after January's contraction indicates potential manufacturing recovery. However, this could be vulnerable to tariff impacts in Q2, creating both upside and downside uncertainty.

4. **Multiple Official Forecast Revisions**: The convergence of multiple authoritative institutions (BoE, OBR, Oxford Economics) toward annual growth forecasts of 0.75-1.0% strongly supports the central scenario of modest positive quarterly growth around 0.2-0.25%.

5. **Cost Pressures Continue**: Rising employer contributions (National Insurance up from 13.8% to 15% in April) create additional cost pressure at the start of Q2, constraining business activity and limiting upside potential.

The evidence largely reinforces the central forecast of modest positive growth (up 0-1%), while suggesting somewhat higher downside risk from tariffs and cost pressures than the outside view captured.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view prediction established a baseline centered on modest positive growth. My inside view analysis suggests:

1. **Increased Downside Risk**: The US tariff implementation is a significant recent structural change not fully reflected in historical data. With 10% tariffs affecting 3/4 of UK exports to a market representing 17% of UK trade, this creates meaningful downside risk.

2. **Lower High-Growth Potential**: The multiple downward forecast revisions from authoritative institutions (BoE, OBR, Oxford Economics, OECD) suggest the likelihood of growth exceeding 2% has diminished.

3. **Central Scenario Remains Valid**: Despite the headwinds, recent data showing 0.5% growth in February and positive production/construction figures support continued modest growth as the most likely outcome.

4. **Blind Spots to Consider**: 
   - Potential for accelerated BoE rate cuts if tariff impacts prove severe
   - Possible UK-US trade negotiations that could reduce tariff impacts
   - Sector-specific effects that may create uneven impact across the economy
   - Inflation trajectory that could constrain consumer spending

Given these considerations, I believe the outside view slightly underestimates downside risk while marginally overestimating upside potential. However, the central scenario remains most probable.

2. **Consumer spending patterns** (mentioned but not quantified)
3. **Global market indicators** (more focused on US than UK implications)

## Timeframe Analysis

The question asks about Q2 2025 (April-June), with today being April 19, 2025. We're forecasting a period that has just begun, with resolution based on the ONS first estimate release on August 14, 2025.

If the timeframe were halved (just April-May), recent positive momentum (+0.5% in February) would carry more weight, potentially shifting probability toward higher growth. The tariff implementation timing (expected summer 2025) would also matter less.

If doubled (Q2-Q3 combined), the tariff impact would definitely be felt, likely increasing probability of lower growth outcomes. The full-year forecasts (consistently revised downward to 0.75-1.4%) would become more directly relevant.

## Justification

Starting with the outside view probabilities, I need to adjust based on current evidence:

1. **Trade tariff impact** (Strong evidence) - The implementation of 10% US tariffs expected in "summer 2025" falls within Q2. With the US accounting for 17% of UK trade and 3/4 of exports subject to tariffs, this creates substantial headwinds not fully captured in historical averages. This shifts probability toward lower growth outcomes.

2. **Recent momentum vs. forecast downgrades** (Strong evidence) - While February showed surprisingly strong 0.5% growth, the consistent downward revisions of 2025 forecasts by all major institutions (BoE, OBR, OECD, Oxford Economics) suggest this momentum is unlikely to be sustained. The average annual forecast now ranges from 0.75-1.4%, implying quarterly growth well below historical averages.

3. **Sectoral mixed signals** (Moderate evidence) - The February improvements in production and construction follow contractions in January, suggesting volatility rather than sustained strength. Manufacturing was specifically identified as performing poorly compared to other major countries.

4. **Timing of monetary easing** (Moderate evidence) - Markets expect a BoE rate cut in May, but the impact on Q2 growth would be limited, as monetary policy typically affects the economy with a lag of several quarters.

These factors justify shifting probability from the higher growth brackets toward moderate growth and contraction scenarios.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view probability distribution appropriately places the highest weight on modest growth outcomes, but current evidence suggests:

1. The likelihood of strong growth (>2%) should be reduced given the consistent downward forecast revisions and imminent tariff implementation.

2. The probability of moderate contraction should be increased given the trade tensions, manufacturing weakness, and forecast downgrades.

3. The center of probability should remain in the modest positive growth range (0-1%), consistent with recent performance and revised annual forecasts.

4. Extreme outcomes (>3% growth or >1% contraction) remain possible but unlikely given recent data.

One blind spot worth noting: a potential US-UK trade agreement averting tariffs could significantly improve the outlook, warranting some probability in higher growth brackets despite current pessimism.

(a) Source Analysis

1) BBC News business article (11 April 2025)  
   • Quality: High. Uses official ONS data. Published recently (April 2025).  
   • Key facts: UK monthly GDP for February 2025 was up 0.5%. Q4 2024 GDP saw a slight uptick. Bank of England (BoE) cut its 2025 growth forecast to 0.75%, Office for Budget Responsibility to 1.0%.  
   • Expert opinions: Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility (both named, credible) signal low (but positive) growth.  

2) Vanguard economic outlook for the UK (no explicit publish date given, references to early 2025)  
   • Quality: High. Vanguard is an established financial institution; their projections consider tariffs and inflation.  
   • Key facts: GDP forecast for end‑2025 was “modestly reduced,” citing higher tariffs (2% → 7% on UK goods). BoE Bank Rate is expected to be cut through 2025.  
   • Expert opinion: Vanguard foresees a slowdown in 2025, consistent with official forecasts.  

3) CNBC article (April 11, 2025)  
   • Quality: High. Uses ONS data for monthly GDP, presents named expert quotes.  
   • Key facts: February GDP rose 0.5% (above consensus). Potential new 10% U.S. tariffs create uncertainty and tilt the BoE toward further rate cuts.  
   • Expert opinion: Suren Thiru (Economics Director, ICAEW) says the risk from US tariffs will weigh on future decisions.  

4) House of Commons Library briefing (28 March 2025)  
   • Quality: High. Government library data.  
   • Key facts: Q4 2024: +0.1% in the UK. OECD revised UK 2025 forecast from 1.7% to 1.4%; IMF raised the 2025 forecast to 1.6%.  
   • Expert opinions: OECD and IMF differ somewhat, but both remain in modest positive territory.  

5) Oxford Economics references (via “UK Economy Shows Slight Improvement…”) (April 19, 2025)  
   • Quality: Moderately high. Oxford Economics is a reputable forecaster.  
   • Key facts: They forecast 1% UK GDP growth in 2025, lowered from prior levels, citing tariff impacts and supply chain concerns.  

6) Additional sources from financial outlets (Qatar National Bank, “Expert RA” on Russia, PHBS on China, IMK on household inflation in Germany, US data, ECB staff projections for Eurozone, etc.)  
   • Quality: Mixed to high, depending on region. The direct relevance to the UK in Q2 2025 is limited, though they highlight trade tensions and weaker global outlook.  
   • Ties to the UK: The global environment is uncertain (tariffs, slower US growth, cost pressures). These factors further support moderate or weaker UK growth.  

Overall: The most relevant and strongest sources for UK Q2 2025 are the ONS-based BBC/CNBC/House of Commons Library data, as well as the BoE and OBR forecasts.  

(b) Evidence Analysis

• Strong evidence:  
  – Official ONS data showing modest quarterly growth since Q4 2024.  
  – Multiple forecasts (BoE, OBR, OECD, IMF, Oxford Economics) converge on modest positive 2025 UK growth in the ~0.7% to 1.6% range.  
  – Structural factors: Ongoing inflation, real wage pressures, and trade disruptions are dampening high-growth scenarios.  

• Moderate evidence:  
  – Continued monthly GDP expansions of ~0.5% (February 2025) indicate some short-term momentum.  
  – Expert commentary (ICAEW, Vanguard) expecting near-term softness with possible rate cuts.  

• Weak evidence:  
  – Anecdotal/business sentiment about the impact of potential new US tariffs. The exact scale/timing is uncertain, so it could spur either a sharper slowdown or merely weigh on sentiment.  
  – Historical “Q2 patterns” can be disrupted by new trade policies.  

(c) Timeframe Analysis

• We are forecasting Q2 2025 growth, which will be reported in mid-August 2025. That is roughly three months away from “today” (April 19, 2025).  
• If we had half the time (one to two months from now), we would rely more on immediate monthly data, which indicates moderate but positive growth so far in 2025.  
• If we doubled this timeframe (six+ months out), the possibility of external shocks (tariffs, supply chain changes) influencing the outlook would increase, potentially widening the range of outcomes.  

(d) Justification

1) Reference Class (Outside View) Baseline: Q2 2024 was +0.5%, Q3 2024 was 0.0%, Q4 2024 was +0.1%, ONS monthly data show modest but persistently positive momentum (Feb +0.5%). Historically, Q2 expansions rarely surpass 2% in the UK’s more constrained post-Covid environment.  
2) Latest Forecasts: BoE and OBR reducing 2025 annual forecasts to around 0.75–1.0% suggests only moderate growth, with inflation and tariff threats capping the upside.  
3) Positive Indicators: The February GDP data was stronger than anticipated, suggesting ongoing resilience, especially in production/construction. Lower rates and continued consumer spending could keep Q2 growth in positive territory.  
4) Negative/Downside Risks: The new US tariffs and industrial slowdown could weigh on manufacturing and exports. Rising costs (wages, energy) may sap household spending.  
5) Net Effect: Combining these factors, the most likely range for Q2 2025 is between 0.0% and 1.0% growth, with a noticeable chance that growth could be somewhat higher (1.0–2.0%), but a small (yet nontrivial) chance of flat/negative outcomes or surprising upside.  

Probability Calibration

• Down >1.0% (i.e., contraction beyond –1.0%): Very unlikely without a sudden severe shock, but non-zero.  
• Down 0.0% to 1.0%: Possible if external headwinds intensify or if consumer spending weakens materially.  
• Up 0.0% to 1.0%: This is the central scenario, in line with 2024’s moderate expansions and official forecasts.  
• Up 1.0% to 2.0%: Credible if Q2 momentum proves slightly stronger or if supply chain concerns ease.  
• Up 2.0% to 3.0%: Less probable, though not impossible (would require notably robust consumer/business activity).  
• Up >3.0%: Requires a big positive shock or major data surprise, which is not strongly signaled.

  – Factual content: Global slowdown concerns, potential new tariffs on UK goods, some references to continuing inflation.  
  – Opinions: Generally revolve around uncertain global trade environment.  

(b) Evidence analysis

Major relevant factors for UK Q2 2025 real GDP growth:

1) Recent monthly GDP growth near +0.5% (stronger than forecast).  
   – Moderately strong evidence: ONS official data, also repeated by BBC/CNBC. Suggests small upward impetus entering Q2.  

2) Annual forecasts by BoE (~0.75%), OBR (1.0%), IMF & OECD also project modest 2025 growth in the UK.  
   – Strong evidence: Multiple official and credible forecasters converge on subdued annual growth. Solid structural and macro analysis.  

3) Potential US tariffs (+10% or more), higher employer NI, energy prices.  
   – Moderate evidence: Clear causal link (trade, business costs) but not fully certain how it will manifest in Q2 specifically.  

4) Recession signals are faint but cannot be dismissed.  
   – Weak to moderate evidence: Some negativity from uncertain trade environment, but so far monthly data is positive, so large negative swings (–1% or more) are less common absent major shock.  

5) UK’s typical quarter‐on‐quarter expansions rarely exceed +1.0% in normal times.  
   – Strong historical pattern. Gains above +2–3% typically require a major rebound scenario.  

On balance, the recognized forecasts (BoE, OBR) and recent ONS data (~0.5% monthly bounce) indicate a small but positive growth environment, though far from robust.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Outcome data for Q2 2025 will be released mid‐August, ~four months from now.  
• If we were forecasting with halved timeframe (two months from now, less data for Q2), we might place a slightly wider distribution or more weight on the “Up 0.0% to +1.0%” bucket, given near‐term monthly improvements plus uncertain tariff effects.  
• If timeframe were doubled (eight months out), we would have additional policy developments and the possibility of deeper global slowdowns or a partial trade resolution; distribution tails might widen to reflect more incremental risk.  

(d) Justification  
1) The baseline (outside view) for UK quarterly GDP growth in mild expansions is often near +0.0% to +0.5%.  
2) The strong February result suggests some momentum into Q2, nudging expectations up slightly.  
3) Offsetting that, US trade friction and higher wage/energy costs weigh on the economy.  
4) Multiple official forecasts still point to subdued but generally positive growth in 2025.  
5) No current sign of a severe contraction or large >3% jump.  

Consolidating these factors, I slightly reduce the chance of a major contraction or a dramatic boom, while keeping the central mass around low‐positive growth.

Probability calibration
Down >1.0%        →  4  (significant negative shock is unlikely, so a small weight)  
Down 0.0% to 1.0% → 18 (chance of mild contraction remains plausible)  
Up 0.0% to 1.0%   → 55 (central scenario: mild positive growth)  
Up 1.0% to 2.0%   → 16 (some chance for a slightly stronger bounce)  
Up 2.0% to 3.0%   →  5 (possible but requires unexpectedly strong rebound)  
Up >3.0%          →  2 (rare outside of shock rebound scenarios)

Forecaster 5 step 2 output: Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
Below is a brief overview of the main sources cited (including the “Asknews_articles” summaries) along with an assessment of their factual vs. opinion content, focusing on institutionally credible commentary:

• BBC News (April 2025) and Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) reports:  
  – These provide official/factual monthly and quarterly GDP statistics (ONS), plus forecasts from recognized authorities (Bank of England, OBR). The data and forecasts from these sources carry strong credibility.  
  – The OBR halved its 2025 forecast to 1.0%, while the Bank of England lowered its growth forecast to around 0.75–1.0%.  
  – Apart from factual data, these sources also include official commentary on risks (e.g., inflation, tariffs).  
  
• Vanguard, CNBC, Morningstar, BlackRock summaries:  
  – These contain market and macroeconomic outlooks from recognized financial institutions. The rationales often cite leading indicators (trade deficits, inflation) and bank rate expectations. While some opinions reflect each firm’s house view, the institutions are well established, so these weigh moderately in credibility.  
  
• House of Commons Library, IMF, OECD extracts:  
  – Present factual macro data (GDP/forecasts) and recognized organizational outlooks. Suitable as strong, data-driven evidence.  

• The more recent “Asknews_articles” covering Qatar National Bank, Oxford Economics, PwC, and other think tanks or corporate analyses:  
  – Provide forward-looking opinions from professional organizations. QNB’s is mostly about the US slowdown. Oxford Economics sees the UK at ~1% growth for 2025. These are moderate-to-strong sources.  
  – Some details concern trade spat impacts or sector-specific statements (e.g., automotive, insurance). These are partly opinion-based but come from named institutions or analysts, giving them moderate credibility.  
  – Overall direction: Slight or moderate growth for the UK, overshadowed by potential trade disruptions.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Using the weighting system:

• Strong evidence:  
  – Official near-term forecasts from Bank of England and OBR (~0.75% to 1.0% for 2025).  
  – Momentum in monthly ONS data: February 2025 GDP +0.5%.  

• Moderate evidence:  
  – Forecaster commentary (Oxford Economics, PwC, Vanguard) pointing to near 1% 2025 UK growth, citing tariffs, cost pressures, and global trade headwinds.  
  – Revisions to earlier 2025 projections (lower than before) but still positive.  

• Weak evidence:  
  – Anecdotal or single-expert speculation that steeper negative prints (>1% contraction) might occur. None of the recognized institutions indicate strong recessionary triggers as of Q2 2025.  
  – Very high growth (>3%) would require a sharp boost or rebound, for which we see little direct evidence.  

Key takeaway: The bulk of credible evidence points toward mild but positive growth for Q2 2025, with limited but nonzero risk of a small negative print.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are forecasting Q2 2025 real GDP growth, which will be known mid-August 2025 (first ONS release). That is ~4 months away. If we had to forecast for a shorter horizon (for example, if Q2 ended in one month), we would rely even more heavily on the Q1 data and real-time indicators. Conversely, if we had 8 months, there could be more scope for unexpected shocks (e.g., deepening trade conflicts) or upside surprises. Our forecast remains in a moderate range given the relatively short time to resolution.

(d) Justification  
We start from a roughly “outside view” historical baseline for UK Q2 growth. Most expansions (outside recession crises) have fallen between 0–2%. We calibrate around 1% as the central tendency, consistent with official forecasts (OBR, BoE).  
• Factors nudging us away from negative territory: recent monthly GDP data (February +0.5%), consistent service-sector resilience, ongoing consumer spending (although dampened by inflation).  
• Factors capping very high growth: tariff concerns, elevated inflation, business investment uncertainties, plus possibly higher short-term interest rates.  
• There is a small risk of mild contraction (if trade tensions escalate or if consumer inflation drains spending more sharply) and a small chance of stronger expansions if global conditions unexpectedly improve.  

Because most recognized forecasters converge on about 1% real GDP growth for calendar-year 2025, the largest probabilities lie in the “Up 0.0% to 1.0%” or “Up 1.0% to 2.0%” ranges. Downside outcomes below –1.0% or upside outcomes above +3.0% both appear less likely given the current environment.

Probability calibration
Informed by the outside view baseline (centered on mild positive growth) and the new data (slightly stronger February reading, but tempered by trade/inflation risks), we shift to a modestly more positive distribution overall, as follows:

Probabilities: [4, 8, 34, 36, 13, 5]
