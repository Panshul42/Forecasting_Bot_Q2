Analysis:
We need to understand how often and under what conditions the CDC has historically upgraded Colombia’s Travel Health Notice from Level 2 to 3 or 4. Key context includes past outbreaks (yellow fever, Zika, dengue, malaria) that triggered upgrades, the CDC’s epidemiological thresholds and internal criteria for raising notices, and the timing/duration of past upgrades. This will form our out‑view (base rate) for Colombia specifically and more broadly for similar countries, which we can then adjust for the current yellow fever situation.

Analysis:
With just over five weeks until the June 1, 2025 resolution date, the key driver for a CDC upgrade is a sustained surge in yellow fever (or another emerging disease) that meets the CDC’s thresholds for a Level 3 or Level 4 Travel Health Notice. I need to track: (a) recent case counts and geographic spread of yellow fever in Colombia; (b) national vaccination campaign progress and healthcare capacity; (c) any formal statements or drafts from the CDC or U.S. State Dept. signaling concern; and (d) shifts in tourism advisories from other agencies (e.g., WHO). Gathering this data will allow an inside‐view adjustment from the baseline of “Level 2” toward a potential “Level 3+” warning.

The NAFSA article “Understanding CDC Travel Health Notices” (April 20, 2022) explains how the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses Travel Health Notices (THNs) to inform travelers and health‑care providers about health risks—like disease outbreaks, special events or natural disasters—at international destinations. Key points:

1. CDC THN Structure  
  • Non‑COVID‑19 THNs (standard system)  
    – Level 1 (Watch): Practice usual precautions  
    – Level 2 (Alert): Practice enhanced precautions  
    – Level 3 (Warning): Avoid all non‑essential travel  
  • COVID‑19 THNs (introduced 2020; revised April 13, 2022)  
    – Level 1: Low level of COVID‑19  
    – Level 2: Moderate level of COVID‑19  
    – Level 3: High level of COVID‑19  
    – Level 4: Special circumstances (“Do Not Travel,” reserved for health‑system collapse or extreme case spikes)  
    – Level Unknown: Insufficient data  

2. April 13, 2022 Revisions to COVID‑19 THNs  
  • Level 4 narrowed to exceptional situations, leading to 89 countries being removed from “Do Not Travel.”  
  • Levels 1–3 remain incidence‑based, using 28‑day case counts.

3. COVID‑19 Vaccine Information on CDC Country Pages  
  • Now lists vaccines authorized under full FDA approval (no longer only Emergency Use Authorization).

4. Use of THNs by Education Abroad Programs  
  • Colleges, universities, and provider organizations incorporate CDC THNs (and vaccination requirements) when assessing the health and safety of study‑abroad destinations.

<Perplexity_report>
Query: Chronical all occasions when the CDC Travel Health Notice for Colombia was raised from Level 2 to Level 3 or above, listing dates and outbreak causes. How many such upgrades have there been, and what were the driving diseases? What specific epidemiological thresholds and criteria does the CDC use to trigger an upgrade to Level 3 or 4? Provide examples including yellow fever, Zika, or other vector‑borne disease outbreaks.
# CDC Travel Health Notice Escalations for Colombia: Epidemiological Thresholds and Historical Context  

Colombia, a country with diverse ecosystems and significant public health challenges, has periodically faced infectious disease outbreaks that warrant attention from international health authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issues Travel Health Notices (THNs) to inform travelers of health risks, categorized into four levels of severity. This report chronicles instances where Colombia’s THN was elevated to **Level 3** ("Reconsider Nonessential Travel") or **Level 4** ("Avoid All Travel"), analyzes the epidemiological criteria governing such escalations, and examines case studies involving vector-borne diseases such as yellow fever and Zika.  

---

## CDC Travel Health Notice Framework  

### Thresholds for Escalation to Level 3 or 4  
The CDC’s criteria for escalating THNs are disease-specific but generally hinge on:  
1. **Transmission Dynamics**: Case counts, incidence rates (per 100,000 population), and trajectory (accelerating/spreading vs. decelerating/contained)[5][11].  
2. **Healthcare System Impact**: Capacity to manage outbreaks, including hospital bed availability, testing, and treatment access[5][9].  
3. **Geographic Spread**: Expansion to new regions or urban centers, particularly areas with historically low vaccination coverage[6][12].  
4. **Mortality and Severity**: Case-fatality rates (CFR) and risk of severe complications (e.g., hemorrhage, organ failure)[12][13].  

For **COVID-19**, Level 3 was triggered by:  
- **Destinations >300,000 people**: >500 new cases over 28 days, incidence rate >3/100,000, and accelerating trajectory[5][11].  
- **Destinations ≤300,000 people**: >10 new cases and accelerating spread[11].  

For **vector-borne diseases** like yellow fever, escalations depend on:  
- Confirmed cases in regions beyond historical endemic zones[6][12].  
- CFR exceeding 10% and evidence of urban transmission risk[6][13].  

---

## Historical Escalations of Colombia’s Travel Health Notices  

### 1. **Yellow Fever Outbreak (April 2025)**  
**Outbreak Details**:  
- **Cases**: 75 confirmed, 34 deaths (CFR: 45.3%) between September 2024 and April 2025[6][13].  
- **Affected Areas**: Tolima, Meta, and Caldas departments, including non-endemic zones like Neira[6].  
- **Risk Factors**: First cases near urban peripheries since 1929, raising concerns about *Aedes aegypti*-driven urban transmission[6][13].  

**CDC Response**:  
- Issued a **Level 2** ("Practice Enhanced Precautions") notice on April 15, 2025, recommending vaccination and mosquito bite prevention[12].  
- Did not escalate to Level 3 despite high CFR, as cases remained concentrated in rural areas with no confirmed urban outbreaks[12][13].  

### 2. **Oropouche Virus (April 2025)**  
**Outbreak Details**:  
- Low-level transmission reported in Colombia, Barbados, Bolivia, and Peru[1][10].  
- Spread via *Culicoides* midges and mosquitoes, causing fever, headache, and myalgia[1][10].  

**CDC Response**:  
- Maintained **Level 1** ("Practice Usual Precautions") for Colombia, citing localized transmission and low case counts[1][10].  

### 3. **Dengue Fever (Ongoing Risk)**  
**Epidemiology**:  
- Endemic in Colombia with cyclical outbreaks every 2–5 years[1][3].  
- In 2024, Colombia reported 61 cases and 30 deaths[4].  

**CDC Posture**:  
- Classified dengue under **Level 1** due to predictable seasonal patterns and existing prevention frameworks[1][3].  

---

## Analysis of Escalation Triggers  

### Absence of Level 3 or 4 Notices for Colombia  
Despite severe outbreaks, Colombia has not received a Level 3 or 4 THN since at least 2020. Key factors include:  
- **Localized Spread**: Yellow fever and Oropouche cases remained concentrated in rural areas, minimizing urban transmission risks[6][10].  
- **Healthcare Response**: Rapid deployment of vaccination campaigns in Tolima and Meta reduced secondary transmission potential[6][13].  
- **Preventive Measures**: CDC prioritized bite prevention and vaccination over travel restrictions, as seen in the April 2025 yellow fever advisory[12][13].  

### Comparative Case: Zika Virus (2015–2016)  
Though not covered in the provided sources, the 2016 Zika epidemic led to a **Level 2** notice for Colombia due to microcephaly risks. The CDC avoided Level 3 due to the disease’s low mortality and focus on prenatal guidance[7].  

---

## Conclusion  

Colombia’s public health landscape is marked by recurrent vector-borne disease threats, yet CDC THNs have remained at Level 2 or below since 2020. Escalation to Level 3 or 4 requires **sustained urban transmission**, **healthcare system overload**, or **CFR >10% in densely populated areas**. The 2025 yellow fever outbreak, while severe, did not meet these thresholds due to effective containment in rural zones. Future risks hinge on climate change expanding mosquito habitats and urbanization encroaching on endemic regions. Travelers to Colombia should prioritize pre-trip vaccination, bite prevention, and monitoring real-time CDC advisories.

<Summary source="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj68x4p412eo">
Colombia has declared a nationwide health emergency after an outbreak of yellow fever has so far caused 74 confirmed cases and at least 34 deaths.

Key facts and figures:
• Outbreak severity: 74 confirmed cases in 2025 versus just two in 2023 and none from 2019–2022.  
• Mortality rate: Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo reports “nearly 50%” of infected patients have died.  
• Geographic focus: Many cases clustered in eastern Tolima province, a major coffee‐producing and tourist region.

Government actions and advisories:
• Vaccination requirement: From mid‑April, anyone traveling to high‑risk areas must show proof of yellow fever vaccination. The vaccine is provided free of charge nationally.  
• Public warnings: President Gustavo Petro urged on social media that “people who have not been vaccinated should not go to high‐risk areas during Easter: for now the coffee area.”

Health context and WHO guidance:
• Yellow fever transmission: Virus spread by infected mosquitoes; preventable via a single, typically lifelong‑protective vaccine.  
• Symptom progression (WHO):  
  – First phase: fever, muscle/back pain, headache, shivers, appetite loss, nausea/vomiting  
  – In ~15% of cases: a “more toxic” second phase with high fever, jaundice, bleeding, kidney failure; ~50% of those patients die within 10–14 days.

<Summary source="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00515.html">
Here is a concise summary of the PrecisionVaccinations article “Colombia’s Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Urban Centers” (April 2025):

• Outbreak scope and geography  
  – Since September 2024, Colombia has confirmed 75 yellow fever (YF) cases and 34 deaths (45% fatality rate).  
  – In 2025, cases have appeared in nine departments:  
    • Tolima (59 cases, 23 deaths)  
    • Putumayo (7)  
    • Nariño (2)  
    • Caquetá (2)  
    • Huila, Vaupés, Cauca, Meta, Caldas (1 each)  
  – Areas affected include the Amazon basin, Magdalena River region, Meta department, and for the first time Neira in Caldas (coffee‑growing region).

• Official response in Colombia  
  – April 15, 2025: Health Secretary Katherine Rengifo Hernández stated, “A new case has arrived in the municipality of Chaparral … the solution is at our fingertips, and that is vaccination,” noting educational checkpoints supported by law enforcement.  
  – April 17, 2025: National Government declared a yellow fever public health emergency to protect lives, contain spread, and mitigate public health impacts.  
  – Vaccination strategy (since Sept 2024):  
    • Expanded age eligibility—from 9 months up through those over 59  
    • Mass immunization campaigns in affected municipalities  
    • Health Promotion Entities to deploy coordinated vaccination teams across public and private networks  

• Risk of urban transmission  
  – Last urban outbreak in Colombia was in 1929; risk persists where Aedes mosquitoes occur (below 2,200 m elevation) and may expand with climate change.  
  – Bogotá (2,640 m; ~8 million residents) is currently above that threshold but could become vulnerable if mosquito ranges shift.

• U.S. CDC actions  
  – April 15, 2025: CDC issued a Level 2 Travel Health Notice for yellow fever in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, advising travelers to get vaccinated ≥10 days before arrival.  
  – As of April 19, 2025, the YF‑VAX (Stamaril) vaccine is commercially available in U.S. travel clinics and pharmacies; vaccination certificates are issued upon completion.

**Ecuador Takes Precautions Against Yellow Fever Outbreak in Colombia**
Ecuador is taking precautions against a yellow fever outbreak in Colombia. At the International Bridge of Rumichaca, health officials are distributing informational flyers to travelers, warning them that yellow fever is a highly lethal disease transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. They advise that the vaccine, the primary preventive measure, must be administered at least 10 days before travel to be effective. Those seeking immunization at the border crossing are referred to local health centers in Tulcán, Ecuador, where they can receive the necessary dose, according to Ecuavisa. Despite the outbreak and warnings, neither Ecuador nor Colombia has required an international vaccination certificate for yellow fever. In Colombia, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths from the disease.

**Colombia Declares National Health Emergency as Yellow Fever Outbreak Spreads**
Colombia has been facing a significant outbreak of yellow fever, a viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The government has declared a national health emergency to mitigate its spread and protect the population. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases of yellow fever, with 36 deaths since 2024. The most affected departments are Tolima and Putumayo, where the majority of cases and deaths have been concentrated. The president, Gustavo Petro, has attributed the increase in cases to the 'climate crisis', which allows mosquitoes to ascend to higher areas and reach urban areas like Bogotá. The government has implemented measures to contain the outbreak, including declaring a health emergency, imposing mobility restrictions in critical areas, and requiring travelers to present vaccination cards to enter or leave the country. The situation is particularly critical in Tolima, where the outbreak began in September 2024 in rural mountainous areas that had not reported cases in over 25 years. The Ministry of Health has declared all municipalities in the departments of Amazonas, Arauca, Caquetá, Casanare, Cesar, Chocó, Guainía, Guaviare, Huila, La Guajira, Meta, Putumayo, Tolima, Vaupés, and Vichada to be at high risk, and specific municipalities in Antioquia, Bolívar, Boyacá, Caldas, Cauca, and Santander are on alert for the outbreak. 'The climate crisis has allowed the mosquitoes to ascend to higher areas and reach urban areas like Bogotá,' said President Gustavo Petro. 'This change in climate has expanded the geographical range of the mosquitoes, increasing the risk of transmission in regions that were not previously considered high-risk.'

**Colombia Reports 79 Yellow Fever Cases, 36 Deaths in 2024-2025**
The Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection released a new epidemiological report on yellow fever cases in the country, which continues to affect various regions, particularly in southern and central departments. According to the official report, between 2024 and 2025, there have been 79 confirmed cases, with 36 deaths. In 2025, there are currently 56 active cases, with 23 deaths reported. The department of Tolima is the most affected, with 38 active cases and 23 confirmed deaths, accounting for the majority of yellow fever deaths in 2025. The Ministry of Health emphasizes the importance of preventive vaccination, especially in rural communities, jungle areas, and regions with a history of virus circulation. Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne disease that can be fatal if not prevented in time. The authorities continue to deploy free vaccination campaigns in strategic points across the country and urge travelers to verify their vaccination schedule before visiting high-risk areas. The Ministry also advises communities to eliminate mosquito breeding sites, use repellent, wear protective clothing, and seek medical attention immediately if symptoms such as high fever, intense headache, nausea, or jaundice appear. 'The Ministry of Health reiterates the importance of preventive vaccination, especially in rural communities, jungle areas, and regions with a history of virus circulation,' said the Ministry. 'Yellow fever is a disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and can be fatal if not prevented in time.'

**Costa Rica Takes Measures Against Yellow Fever Outbreak in Colombia ⋆ The Costa Rica News**
Costa Rican authorities are taking measures against a yellow fever outbreak in Colombia. The Ministry of Health is considering additional measures and will continue to monitor the regional outlook for the disease. The ministry has maintained the mandatory vaccination status starting May 11, and extended the yellow fever vaccination requirement for travelers from high-risk areas due to a current shortage of vaccines. 'Yellow fever is a serious disease, preventable with a safe vaccine,' an official statement explains. 'If the person travels to areas where the virus is circulating, they should be vaccinated in advance.' According to the Ministry of Health and PAHO/WHO, 65 cases of the disease were detected in humans in the Region of the Americas in 2024, and 16 cases were reported in Costa Rica in the fourth week of 2025.

**Colombia Declares Health Emergency Due to Yellow Fever Outbreak**
Colombia has declared a health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. To prevent the spread of the disease, the Colombian authorities are requiring travelers to present their yellow fever vaccination card. According to Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo, 'We will have to go back to requiring people coming from Brazil to present their international vaccination card.' Since September last year, there have been 79 cases of yellow fever in Colombia, resulting in 36 deaths. The presence of the mosquito transmitter Aedes aegypti has been detected below 2,200 meters above sea level. President Gustavo Petro has ordered a massive vaccination campaign to immunize the entire population. 'Every soldier and teacher must be vaccinated as soon as possible,' he said. Travelers from Ecuador will also be required to present their yellow fever vaccination card. The outbreak has led to a reversal of the previous measure, which had been lifted. The requirements for traveling to Colombia include presenting the yellow fever vaccination card for tourists and business travelers.

**Colombia Declares National Health Emergency Due to Yellow Fever Outbreak**
The Colombian Ministry of Health has published a list of municipalities at high risk for yellow fever. According to the latest data, over 400 municipalities are at 'high' or 'very high' risk. The list includes Manizales (Caldas), Florencia (Caquetá), Neiva (Huila), Ipiales (Nariño), Ǫuinchía (Risalrada), Melgar (Tolima), Mocoa (Putumayo), Mitú (Vaupés), among others. The Ministry of Health has declared a national health emergency due to the increase in yellow fever cases. The resolution requires the intensification of vaccination efforts, particularly in high-risk municipalities. In these areas, authorities must review vaccination records and administer vaccines to all susceptible individuals from 9 months of age onwards, including those over 59 years old, foreigners, and migrants. The resolution also prioritizes vaccination for healthcare workers. In municipalities with lower risk, vaccination will be made available to those who request it. The Ministry of Health has recommended that the government not restrict travel to areas with high risk of yellow fever transmission, but instead offer vaccination to travelers who request it. The resolution also orders the implementation of measures to control vectors, such as mosquitoes, and the activation of community-based surveillance systems to report cases of yellow fever. 'Declare a national health emergency due to the active circulation of the yellow fever virus, until at least eight epidemiological weeks have passed without human cases or epizootias,' the resolution reads. 'Intensify vaccination efforts, particularly in high-risk municipalities, and review vaccination records to administer vaccines to all susceptible individuals from 9 months of age onwards,' it adds.

**Costa Rica Takes Measures in Response to Yellow Fever Outbreak in Colombia**
Costa Rica has taken measures in response to a yellow fever outbreak in Colombia. The Ministry of Health has expressed concern and is considering additional actions. The government of Colombia has declared a health and economic emergency due to the active circulation of the virus. The Ministry of Health in Costa Rica will continue to monitor the regional situation and will communicate any changes to measures. Currently, the country requires travelers from high-risk areas to be up-to-date with the yellow fever vaccine, which will remain in effect until May 11.

**Colombia Faces Yellow Fever Crisis Amid Rising Cases and Deaths**
Colombia is facing a crisis due to the resurgence of yellow fever, with 47 confirmed cases and 20 deaths reported this year. The country's president, Gustavo Petro, has declared a state of emergency and economic emergency, but the decision has been met with criticism. The majority of cases are concentrated in the Tolima department, where 41 cases have been reported, with a mortality rate of 43%. The spread of the disease is attributed to the expansion of the Aedes aegypti mosquito to high-altitude areas of the Andean cordillera, due to rising temperatures caused by climate change. Petro warned that the mosquito is 'allowing the virus to reach zones previously protected, like Bogotá.' The situation in Colombia is not isolated, with 131 cases and 53 deaths reported in the region this year, according to the Pan American Health Organization. Brazil leads the statistics with 81 cases and 31 deaths, followed by Peru and Bolivia. Experts agree that the risk of propagation is high. 'Yellow fever represents a threat to regional and international public health security,' warned the OPS in its latest epidemiological bulletin. The Colombian Ministry of Health has intensified vaccination campaigns and emphasized that immunization offers 95% protection just 10 days after application. Over 54,000 people have been vaccinated this year in prioritized municipalities, mostly within the epidemiological cord of Tolima. In Bogotá, although it is not considered an endemic area, local authorities have vaccinated over 19,000 people, mainly travelers and migrants. However, the presidential announcement of the emergency has generated friction with the district administration. 'To control yellow fever, you have to vaccinate in endemic areas, in areas with environmental conditions. That's where you cut the transmission chain because that's where the mosquito bites,' explained Julián Fernández Niño, subsecretary of Public Health, who questioned the national government's approach.

**Colombia Faces Critical Yellow Fever Outbreak: What You Need to Know**
Colombia is facing a critical situation with 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths of yellow fever between September 2024 and April 2025, according to the Ministry of Health. The government has declared a national health emergency through mass and mandatory vaccination. Although there are no specific cities reported as epicenters of the outbreak, the cases are concentrated in rural areas, particularly in Tolima, Putumayo, Meta, Caldas, and Huila. The mosquito Aedes aegypti is present in Bogotá, Medellín, and other capitals, with alert in 19 departments for possible propagation. The Minister of Health of Colombia stated that yellow fever is a highly lethal viral disease that can compromise different organs and, in severe cases, cause death in a few days. The symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, chills, and yellow color in the conjunctivas. The vaccination against yellow fever in Colombia is free, available in vaccination points throughout the country, and offered without barriers of access for all people, regardless of their affiliation to the health system, nationality, or migratory status, especially for those who transit, reside, or travel to high-risk areas. A single dose of the vaccine is required for life, and if it is not possible to verify the vaccination history, it is recommended to vaccinate. The vaccine is effective against the disease from the 10th day of its application, reaching an immunity of 99% after 30 days.

**Rising Yellow Fever Cases, Deaths Lead To Health Emergency In Colombia**
Colombia has declared a health emergency due to a surge in yellow fever cases and deaths. Since the beginning of last year, there have been 74 confirmed infections and 34 deaths, according to Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo. The yellow fever vaccine is provided free of charge in Colombia, and health officials are urging citizens to get vaccinated ahead of the Easter weekend. Minister Jaramillo noted that the current outbreak has a nearly 50 percent mortality rate, stating, 'This has been particularly deadly.' The majority of cases have been concentrated in the eastern part of Tolima province, and the situation mirrors a broader regional concern, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) elevating the yellow fever risk in South America to Level 2. Travelers to Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru are advised to take enhanced precautions, including vaccination at least 10 days before travel and strict mosquito bite prevention measures.

**Colombia Faces Yellow Fever Outbreak: Free Vaccination Available**
Colombia is facing a delicate situation with regards to yellow fever. In 2024 and early 2025, numerous confirmed cases have been identified, prompting an urgent response from the Ministry of Health. To address this, free access to the vaccine has been made available across the country. The situation has worsened in recent months, with cases appearing in Dolores, Melgar, and Villarrica, prompting authorities to take urgent measures. 'This is largely due to a situation that began in Colombia in September last year,' said Jaramillo. 'An unusual outbreak in the eastern part of Tolima has spread to more municipalities, despite the work being done.' The virus, transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes, primarily of the Aedes and Haemagogus genera, can cause a severe hemorrhagic disease. Therefore, vaccination is considered the primary measure of protection. The vaccine is safe, free, and available to anyone, regardless of their health affiliation, nationality, or immigration status. It is primarily directed at people between 1 and 19 years old, but is also administered to those over 60 years old in high-risk areas, starting from 9 months old. The vaccine provides immunity within 10 days of application and offers up to 99% protection in the first month. In addition to vaccination, it is recommended to practice protection measures such as wearing clothing that covers the skin, applying repellent, and sleeping with mosquito nets, as well as eliminating mosquito breeding sites in urban areas. Travelers from countries such as Angola, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo are required to be vaccinated upon entry into the country. Prevention and timely vaccination remain the most effective way to prevent new outbreaks of yellow fever in the country. Yellow fever is a viral disease present in the Caribbean and South America, with a higher concentration in the Amazon region. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), yellow fever is endemic in regions of 13 countries in the Americas: Colombia, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.

**Colombia Declares State of Emergency Over Deadly Yellow Fever Outbreak**
Colombian President Gustavo Petro declared a state of emergency due to a deadly outbreak of yellow fever, which has claimed the lives of 34 people. The government has mobilized over 80,000 people, including medical professionals, to address the crisis. The strategy to control the virus focuses on mass vaccination, with over 8,000 people over 70 years old having been vaccinated so far. According to Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso, the virus has spread beyond its usual risk zones, including the Amazon region, Catatumbo, and Chocó. 'This makes the virus a threat to more communities,' he said. The situation is most critical in the department of Tolima, where the number of cases has increased from four to 22 since September 2024. The government has implemented measures to control the spread of the virus, including requiring travelers to present their vaccination cards. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has raised its alert level for yellow fever in South America to level 2, recommending vaccination for travelers to the region. Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease that can cause fever, muscle pain, and headache, as well as more severe complications such as kidney problems, bleeding, and death. There is no specific treatment for the disease, and prevention focuses on avoiding stagnant water that serves as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and vaccination.

Colombia's President Gustavo Petro announced an economic emergency and called on citizens to get vaccinated, warning those who have not been vaccinated to avoid high-risk areas during Easter. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also upgraded its yellow fever alert for South America to level two, advising travelers to consider getting vaccinated or receiving booster shots before visiting certain areas.

**Colombia Declares Health Emergency Due to Yellow Fever Outbreak**
Due to the increase in yellow fever cases, the Colombian government has declared a 'health emergency' nationwide. According to Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo, there have been 74 confirmed cases and 34 deaths since the beginning of the year. Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted by the bites of Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. Minister Jaramillo stated that the most critical situation is in western Tolima, where 22 cases have been detected. The number of cases has increased by two times compared to the entire year of 2024. According to the Pan American Health Organization, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru are the most affected countries. Two approved vaccines are available for the disease, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the yellow fever vaccine for individuals aged 9 months and older who travel to high-risk areas. As stated by 'Vax Before Travel News', there were 131 yellow fever cases and 53 related deaths in the Americas in the first three months of 2025, which is more than twice the number of cases seen in 2024.

**Costa Rica Takes Measures in Response to Yellow Fever Outbreak in Colombia**
Costa Rica has taken measures in response to a yellow fever outbreak in Colombia. The Ministry of Health has expressed concern and is considering additional actions. The government of Colombia has declared a health and economic emergency due to the active circulation of the virus. The Ministry of Health in Costa Rica will continue to monitor the regional situation and will communicate any changes to measures. Currently, the country requires travelers from high-risk areas to be up-to-date with the yellow fever vaccine, which will remain in effect until May 11. The vaccine is effective 10 days after application and provides lifelong protection. According to the Ministry of Health, 'yellow fever is a serious disease, preventable with a safe vaccine. If a person travels to areas with virus circulation, they should vaccinate in advance.' Costa Rica has required the international vaccination certificate for travelers from high-risk regions since 2007. The yellow fever virus is transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is endemic in tropical areas of South America and Africa. In 2024, 65 cases of the disease were detected in humans in the Americas, and in the fourth week of 2025, 16 cases were reported in Costa Rica.

**Colombia Declares Emergency as Yellow Fever Outbreak Spreads**
Following an alert from President Petro, Colombians are flocking to get vaccinated against yellow fever. Petro, who declared a state of emergency, said, 'I got vaccinated for two reasons: one personal, for health, because I'm traveling, and second, for a social reason, simply to follow what the president has told us and to have awareness that this is a problem for everyone.' Suárez, a 39-year-old teacher, told The Associated Press. The country has registered 74 confirmed cases and 32 deaths this year, according to Petro. The government has activated a contingency plan in the department of Huila, where the majority of cases have been concentrated. The yellow fever virus causes fever, muscle pain, and nausea, and some patients also experience ictericia, a yellowish discoloration of the skin. The disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Cristopher Cabrera, a 23-year-old tourist from Mexico, arrived in Colombia without knowing about the new outbreak. He got vaccinated at the terminal of transportation in Bogotá, recommended by the tourism agency, before embarking on a trip to Medellín and Doradal. Cabrera is concerned that 'in the middle of the trip, someone could get infected and we could get sick', he told AP. Petro raised the alert, warning that the outbreak could spread beyond the usual departments that report cases or maintain vigilance due to their warm climates. He noted that Bogotá remains at risk, not because of transmission of yellow fever, but because of travelers coming from high-risk areas. 'If the mosquito behaved as before, there would be no infection in the coffee-growing regions. But today there is, because the average temperature has increased due to greenhouse gases,' Petro said on Twitter. The Secretary of Health of Bogotá, Gerson Bermont, clarified that the capital is not endemic for yellow fever, but they are accelerating the vaccination process. According to the World Health Organization, vaccination is the primary measure to prevent yellow fever. Petro assured that the number of victims 'will be very small' if they work quickly on inoculation and hospital preparedness.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **NAFSA article - Understanding CDC Travel Health Notices:**
   - Explains CDC's THN system structure: Non-COVID notices range from Level 1 (Watch) to Level 3 (Warning), while COVID-19 notices range from Level 1 (Low) to Level 4 (Special circumstances).
   - Factual information about the CDC's warning system with no expressed opinions.
   - High quality for understanding the classification system itself.

2. **Cidrap.umn article (April 16, 2025):**
   - Reports CDC's Level 2 travel notice for yellow fever in South America issued April 15, 2025.
   - Details yellow fever case counts: 131 confirmed cases and 53 deaths in Jan-Mar 2025 vs. 61 cases/30 deaths in all of 2024.
   - Factual reporting with statistics from credible health organizations (CDC, PAHO).
   - Directly relevant as it confirms current THN status and provides disease metrics.

3. **Silive.com article (April 19, 2025):**
   - Reports U.S. State Department's Level 3 advisory for Colombia due to civil unrest and kidnapping risks.
   - Less relevant to our question as it pertains to State Department security advisories, not CDC health notices.
   - Factual reporting of government advisory details.

4. **Cidrap article on Colombia's yellow fever emergency (April 18, 2025):**
   - Reports Colombia's health ministry declaring a public health emergency on April 17, 2025.
   - Details 75 confirmed cases, 34 deaths (45.3% fatality rate) since September 2024.
   - Notes outbreak expansion to multiple departments and risk of urban transmission.
   - High-quality factual reporting with specific epidemiological data.
   - Highly relevant as it details the progression of the yellow fever outbreak.

5. **Perplexity Report:**
   - Analyzes CDC escalation thresholds and Colombia's THN history.
   - For vector-borne diseases, escalation criteria include: urban transmission, healthcare system strain, and high fatality rates in populated areas.
   - Notes Colombia has not received Level 3+ THN since at least 2020 despite serious outbreaks.
   - Mixed factual reporting and analysis, but analysis appears evidence-based.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

1. **Historical THN escalations for Colombia:**
   - According to the Perplexity report, Colombia has not received a Level 3 or 4 THN since at least 2020.
   - Limited historical data makes this reference class somewhat weak.

2. **Vector-borne disease outbreaks leading to THN escalations:**
   - The 2016 Zika epidemic resulted only in Level 2 notices despite widespread concern.
   - Yellow fever escalation appears to require urban transmission, which hasn't occurred in Colombia since 1929.

3. **Yellow fever outbreaks in South America:**
   - Current outbreak shows high case-fatality rate (45.3%) but remains largely rural.
   - Expanding to new regions but hasn't reached major population centers.

**Most suitable reference class:** Vector-borne disease outbreaks in South America, particularly yellow fever, as this provides specific criteria for THN escalation in similar contexts.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is approximately 38 days (April 23 to June 1, 2025).

- Yellow fever outbreak has been ongoing for about 7 months (since September 2024).
- Colombia declared a public health emergency just 6 days ago (April 17, 2025).
- CDC issued the Level 2 THN only 8 days ago (April 15, 2025).
- In recent months, cases have increased significantly (75 confirmed cases vs. 61 in all of 2024).
- The short timeframe limits the potential for dramatic escalation, but the accelerating case count and expanding geographic reach are concerning factors.

## (d) Justification:

Several factors suggest a relatively low probability of escalation to Level 3+ before June 1:

1. **Historical precedent:** Colombia has not received a Level 3+ THN for any disease since at least 2020.

2. **Current containment:** Despite the high case-fatality rate (45.3%), cases remain concentrated in rural areas with no confirmed urban transmission.

3. **Clear escalation criteria:** For vector-borne diseases, the CDC appears to require urban transmission, healthcare system overload, or extremely high case counts in populated areas before issuing Level 3 notices.

4. **Preventative focus:** CDC currently emphasizes vaccination and bite prevention rather than travel restrictions.

5. **Response mechanisms:** Colombia has deployed vaccination teams since September and declared a public health emergency.

However, several risk factors could increase escalation probability:

1. **Geographic expansion:** The outbreak is spreading to previously unaffected areas.

2. **Urban transmission risk:** Recent cases in low-density outskirts raise concern about spread to cities.

3. **Rising case counts:** The accelerating trend suggests continued worsening.

4. **Extremely high fatality rate:** 45.3% CFR significantly exceeds the 10% threshold mentioned in the Perplexity report.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I'm considering:

1. The historical rarity of Level 3+ THNs for Colombia (suggesting <10% baseline).

2. The specific criteria for vector-borne disease escalation, particularly urban transmission, which hasn't occurred yet but shows increasing risk.

3. The short timeframe (38 days) provides limited opportunity for dramatic escalation, but the recent declaration of public health emergency suggests authorities view the situation as critical.

4. The CDC only recently (April 15) issued the Level 2 notice, suggesting they would need compelling new evidence to escalate further within weeks.

5. The extremely high case-fatality rate (45.3%) exceeds the 10% threshold cited as a criterion for escalation, but is counterbalanced by the limited geographic spread.

Based on these factors, I estimate that urban transmission has approximately a 20% chance of occurring within the timeframe, and that such transmission would have roughly a 70% chance of triggering a Level 3+ THN.

## Outside View Prediction:
14%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

### NAFSA Article on CDC Travel Health Notices (April 2022)
This source provides the framework for CDC Travel Health Notices (THNs), explaining their structure and significance. It details the standard non-COVID THN levels: Level 1 (Watch), Level 2 (Alert), and Level 3 (Warning), which is factual information useful for establishing baseline criteria. The article appears objective and informational without notable opinions.

### CIDRAP Article on Yellow Fever in South America (April 16, 2025)
This recent article reports that the CDC issued a Level 2 ("Practice Enhanced Precautions") travel notice for yellow fever in South America on April 15, 2025, which includes Colombia. It cites PAHO data showing 131 confirmed cases and 53 deaths in Jan-Mar 2025, compared to 61 cases and 30 deaths in all of 2024. The source is factual, from a reputable health reporting organization, and provides critical current information without evident opinion bias.

### U.S. Embassy Travel Advisory Article (April 19, 2025)
This source reports that the U.S. State Department (not CDC) issued a Level 3 "Reconsider Travel" advisory for Colombia on April 17, 2025. However, this advisory focuses on civil unrest and kidnapping risks—not health concerns. While factual, this State Department advisory operates under a different system than CDC health notices and addresses security rather than health risks.

### CIDRAP Article on Colombia Yellow Fever Emergency (April 18, 2025)
This highly relevant article reports that Colombia declared a public health emergency for yellow fever on April 17, 2025. It details 75 confirmed cases and 34 deaths (45.3% fatality rate) since September 2024, with cases in nine departments (mostly Tolima). The outbreak is expanding into new regions, including the Amazon basin. Though no urban transmission has occurred since 1929, recent cases in low-density outskirts raise risk to larger cities. The article confirms the CDC's Level 2 notice issued earlier that week. This appears to be factual reporting from a reputable source.

### Perplexity Report on CDC Travel Health Notice History
This report analyzes CDC THN escalation thresholds, stating that Colombia has not received a Level 3 or 4 THN since at least 2020. It outlines criteria for THN escalation including transmission dynamics, healthcare system impact, geographic spread, and mortality rates. For vector-borne diseases like yellow fever, it notes escalation depends on spread beyond endemic zones and urban transmission risk. While fact-based, this report also contains synthesized information and analytical conclusions.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several relevant reference classes emerge:

1. **CDC THN history for Colombia**: According to the Perplexity report, Colombia has not received a Level 3 or 4 THN since at least 2020, suggesting a low baseline probability.

2. **Yellow fever outbreaks in South America**: The current outbreak's metrics (75 cases, 34 deaths, 45.3% fatality rate) and the Colombian public health emergency declaration provide specific context.

3. **Vector-borne disease outbreaks globally**: The Perplexity report suggests that even during the 2016 Zika outbreak, Colombia only reached Level 2 despite widespread transmission.

4. **Countries with declared public health emergencies**: Colombia's recent declaration for yellow fever may influence CDC's assessment.

The most suitable reference class is #2 (yellow fever outbreaks in South America and resulting CDC responses), as it most specifically addresses the current situation with data on case counts, fatality rates, and transmission patterns, plus we have information on the CDC's threshold criteria for vector-borne disease notices.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The forecast covers a 39-day period from April 23 to June 1, 2025. Key temporal considerations:

- The yellow fever outbreak has been ongoing since September 2024 (7+ months)
- As recently as April 15, 2025 (just 8 days ago), the CDC evaluated the situation and determined a Level 2 notice was appropriate
- The forecast window covers late spring, potentially increasing mosquito activity with warmer weather
- Colombia declared a public health emergency on April 17, suggesting the situation may be worsening

## (d) Justification

The outside view prediction must weigh several crucial factors:

1. **Current outbreak severity**: While yellow fever in Colombia shows a high case fatality rate (45.3%), the absolute numbers remain relatively low (75 cases since September 2024). The geographic expansion and public health emergency declaration indicate serious concern.

2. **CDC level elevation thresholds**: According to the Perplexity report, vector-borne disease escalation to Level 3 typically requires confirmed cases beyond endemic zones (occurring), evidence of urban transmission (potential but not confirmed), and/or healthcare system strain (no evidence provided).

3. **Recent CDC assessment**: Just 8 days ago, the CDC evaluated the situation and deemed Level 2 appropriate. The situation would need to meaningfully worsen to trigger an upgrade within our timeframe.

4. **Outbreak trajectory**: The yellow fever outbreak is expanding to new areas, and cases are appearing in outskirts that raise urban transmission risks—a key escalation factor.

5. **Preventive measures**: Colombia has deployed vaccination teams to affected areas since September, which could help contain the outbreak.

6. **Historical CDC conservatism**: The Perplexity report suggests the CDC has historically been conservative in elevating notices for vector-borne diseases.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I note:

1. The base rate suggests Colombia rarely receives Level 3 health notices (none since at least 2020).

2. The current yellow fever outbreak shows:
   - High case fatality rate (45.3%)
   - Geographic expansion toward urban areas
   - Triggering of a public health emergency

3. For a Level 3 elevation, we would typically need:
   - Confirmed urban transmission (not yet present)
   - Significant acceleration in case growth
   - Healthcare system strain

4. The CDC recently assessed this situation (April 15) and chose Level 2, indicating their evaluation that Level 3 criteria weren't yet met.

5. The 39-day timeframe offers sufficient time for the situation to evolve, particularly with seasonal factors potentially increasing transmission.

## Outside View Prediction:
27%

I assess there's a 27% probability that the CDC will raise Colombia's Travel Health Notice to Level 3 or higher before June 1, 2025. This reflects the serious and expanding nature of the yellow fever outbreak balanced against the CDC's threshold criteria, their recent Level 2 assessment, historical conservatism with vector-borne diseases, and ongoing preventive vaccination efforts.

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
  a. CDC travel‐health notice structure (NAFSA summary, April 2022): A high‐quality, official summary describing how CDC classifies non–COVID and COVID THNs. Factual; no opinions. Establishes baseline that non–COVID THNs have only three levels and that Level 3 is “avoid all non‐essential travel.”  
  b. Cidrap report on yellow fever in South America (April 16, 2025): A reputable public‐health news site. Factual epidemiology (cases, deaths, geographies) and CDC’s response (Level 2 for yellow fever). No opinions misidentified as facts.  
  c. U.S. State Department advisory for Colombia (April 17, 2025): A journalistic summary of a security advisory (Level 3 “Reconsider Travel”). Relevant to travel advice but driven by security concerns, not CDC health‐risk criteria. Opinions by security analysts are clearly delineated.  
  d. Colombia’s public‐health emergency for yellow fever (April 18, 2025): Official Colombian ministry declaration reported by Cidrap. High‐quality factual data on outbreak size, case‐fatality rate, geographic spread, and vaccination response.  
  e. Perplexity report on THN escalations: A machine‐generated synthesis with no direct sourcing or citations. Contains plausible generalizations (e.g., thresholds for COVID THN Level 3) but makes unverified claims about Colombia’s history of THN escalations. We treat it as low‐confidence.

2. Reference‐class analysis  
  We consider three possible classes:  
  • All CDC non–COVID THN upgrades from Level 2 to Level 3 worldwide over the past three years (including e.g. cholera, measles, ebola). Finding: extremely rare—only a handful (e.g., ebola in West Africa, cholera in Yemen), none for vector‐borne diseases in the Americas.  
  • Vector‐borne disease outbreaks in Latin America triggering THN changes >Level 2 (e.g., yellow fever, Zika): virtually zero precedent. The April 2025 yellow fever outbreak prompted only Level 2. The 2016 Zika epidemic prompted Level 2, not Level 3.  
  • Security‐driven travel advisories (State Department): Overlaps poorly with CDC health‐driven notices. State Dept Level 3 for Colombia on April 17 had no bearing on CDC THN.

  The best reference class is “CDC non–COVID THN escalations above Level 2 for vector‐borne outbreaks in Latin America.” Observed frequency = 0 of ~10 serious outbreaks (Zika 2016, yellow fever 2017, 2018, 2025).

3. Timeframe analysis  
  • Horizon: April 23–June 1, 2025 (~39 days).  
  • Outbreak timeline: PHE declared April 17; CDC issued Level 2 on April 15 based on rising cases early April.  
  • Historical lags: CDC took ~days to weeks to issue Level 2 after PAHO alerts. Level 3 thresholds (urban transmission, healthcare collapse) have not yet been met and often require sustained acceleration. Few if any vector outbreaks trigger Level 3 within 6 weeks.  

4. Justification for outside‐view prediction  
  • Base‐rate (reference class): 0% of comparable vector‐borne outbreaks in Latin America ever led to a CDC THN >2.  
  • Adjustment for severity: This yellow fever outbreak is unusually severe (45% CFR), declared a PHE, and spreading beyond historical zones. That pushes probability up from a flat zero.  
  • Remaining time: Only ~6 weeks remain; no current evidence of urban‐center transmission or healthcare system collapse in major cities.  
  • Decision inertia: CDC may prefer to wait for clear evidence of urban transmission before elevating to Level 3, and historically has been cautious about triggering Level 3 for non–airborne/vector diseases.  
  • Downside/upside asymmetry: Over‐warning (Level 3) could discourage essential aid and vaccines; CDC tends to reserve Level 3 for very large or rapidly rising threats.

Outside‐view calibration:

  Starting from a reference‐class base‐rate near 0%, we introduce a modest boost (to reflect exceptionally high CFR and PHE status). We then temper that by the short timeline and the absence of urban spread. The calibration therefore lands in the single‐digit to low‐teens percentile range.

Outside View Prediction:
  There is a **10%** chance that the CDC will raise Colombia’s non–COVID Travel Health Notice status above Level 2 (i.e., to Level 3 or 4) on or before June 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source Analysis  
  • “Understanding CDC Travel Health Notices” (NAFSA, Apr 20 2022)  
    – Summary: Explains CDC’s four‐level THN system for non‑COVID and COVID; outlines criteria (case counts, incidence, health‑system impact).  
    – Quality: High – NAFSA is a respected education‐abroad association summarizing official CDC guidelines. Factual, minimal opinion.  
  • Cidrap article on Level 2 Yellow Fever Notice (Apr 16 2025)  
    – Summary: CDC issued Level 2 THN for yellow fever across South America due to rising cases in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia; urges vaccination and boosters.  
    – Quality: High – Cidrap is a reputable infectious‑disease news service. Facts clearly cited from CDC and PAHO; expert quotes are attributed.  
  • U.S. State Department advisory re‑Level 3 for Colombia (silive.com via U.S. Embassy, Apr 19 2025)  
    – Summary: SD raised travel advisory to Level 3 (“Reconsider Travel”) because of civil unrest, kidnapping risk in specific departments. Recommends security precautions.  
    – Quality: Medium‑high – Official U.S. Embassy release, but focuses on security rather than health. Factual but less directly relevant to CDC health notices.  
  • CDC Yellow Fever Emergency Declaration (Apr 18 2025)  
    – Summary: Colombia declared a national emergency for yellow fever; 75 cases, 34 deaths; spread into new departments; vaccination campaigns under way.  
    – Quality: High – Official Colombian government release summarized by CIDRAP/PAHO. Reliable epidemiological data.  
  • Perplexity Report on historical THN escalations  
    – Summary: Claims no Level 3 or 4 THNs for Colombia since 2020; details generic CDC thresholds for COVID and vector‑borne diseases. Provides examples (yellow fever, Zika).  
    – Quality: Low – AI‐generated synthesis with sparse citations. Useful for framing but must be cross‑checked against primary CDC sources.  

2. Reference Class Analysis  
  Possible reference classes:  
  a. All countries with yellow fever THNs in past five years (how often CDC elevated to Level 3).  
  b. All countries in South America for any THN escalation from Level 2→3 within a given year.  
  c. All vector‑borne disease outbreaks prompting CDC Level 3 THNs globally.  
  d. All non‑COVID THN changes for Colombia specifically over the last 5 years.  
  Suitability: (d) is too narrow (zero events). (c) is broad but gives sense of rarity. (b) and (a) both point to CDC’s near‐zero use of Level 3 for yellow fever or vector‐borne diseases. The best reference class is “historical frequency of CDC issuing Level 3 or 4 THNs for yellow fever (or other vector‑borne diseases) in South American countries over a comparable 1–2 month window.” In five years, CDC has never gone above Level 2 for yellow fever in any South American country outside a handful of exceptional circumstances (none for Colombia).  

3. Timeframe Analysis  
  • Forecast window: Today is Apr 23 2025; cutoff is Jun 1 2025 – ~39 days remain.  
  • Historically, CDC convenes emergency committees and assesses 28‑day incidence for vector‑borne diseases. Any decision to escalate would likely require at least 2–3 weeks of worsening data plus internal deliberation. That leaves at most two full 28‑day windows, but in the most recent window (Jan–Mar 2025) PAHO already sounded alert and CDC responded with Level 2. No new acceleration through mid‑Apr.  

4. Justification for Outside View  
  • Rarity of Level 3+ for vector‑borne diseases: In the last five years, CDC has generally capped yellow fever THNs at Level 2 even during major outbreaks (e.g., Angola 2016, Brazil 2018). Level 3 has been reserved for severe pandemic or collapse scenarios (e.g., COVID Level 4).  
  • Current outbreak trajectory: 75 cases/34 deaths is severe (CFR 45%) but remains largely rural with no confirmed urban transmission chains. Vaccination campaigns are active. PAHO and CDC have thus far judged enhanced precautions (Level 2) adequate.  
  • Institutional inertia and criteria: CDC’s publicly stated thresholds for Level 3 ($>$10 cases accelerating in small populations or $>$500 cases in large ones for COVID, CFR >10% plus urban risk for yellow fever) are not formally codified for non‑COVID but de‑facto they require urban spread. None has materialized.  
  • Time constraints: Only ~5 weeks remain. To go from Level 2→3, CDC would need to see another sharp uptick or new threat (e.g., overlapping dengue/COVID resurgence or a new hemorrhagic disease). No sign of that so far.  
  • Comparative security advisories do not translate into health‐notice escalations. The State Dept’s Level 3 travel advisory for violence does not feed CDC health thresholds.  

Outside view calibration:  
  • Base‐rate from reference class: 0 escalations in ~5 years for yellow fever THNs in South America → empirical annual probability ≈0%.  
  • Adjust upwards modestly for uncertainty: outbreak is unusually severe CFR, and can still worsen. Insert a small “shock risk” (e.g., urban spillover).  
  • Conservative floor: 1% to allow any chance of surprise.  
  • Conservative ceiling: 10% to account for potential second wave or new pathogen. Best‐guess midpoint: ~5%.  

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 5% probability that the CDC will raise Colombia’s Travel Health Notice above Level 2 (i.e., to Level 3 or 4) by June 1, 2025.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• CDC country page (implicit in the question). Factual: Colombia is currently on a non‑COVID‑19 Level 2 THN (“Practice Enhanced Precautions”). No opinions. Very high reliability – primary source.  
• CIDRAP 16 Apr 2025 article. Factual: CDC issued a new Level 2 notice for yellow fever in S. America; PAHO case counts; vaccination advice. Minimal opinion (quotes by experts on vaccine behaviour). CIDRAP is a long‑standing infectious‑disease news service tied to the Univ. of Minnesota → high quality.  
• CIDRAP 18 Apr 2025 article. Factual: Colombian health‑ministry emergency, exact case & death figures, geographic spread. High reliability; again mostly factual reporting of official statements.  
• silive.com 19 Apr 2025 article on State‑Dept security advisory. Factual: State‑Dept raised its separate security level to 3. That system is unrelated to CDC THNs but shows Colombia can receive higher advisories from US agencies. Medium quality; facts easily verifiable on State‑Dept site.  
• Perplexity report. Compiles prior events and general criteria for THN upgrades. Partly factual (historical Ebola, Marburg, polio examples, CDC escalation criteria) and partly extrapolation / commentary by the LLM. Use only the sections that can be cross‑checked (e.g., the existence of Marburg Level 3 notices, criteria language taken from CDC technical notes). Treat narrative speculation as opinion. Overall, moderate reliability.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes  
1. All ~220 destinations currently sitting at Level 2 for non‑COVID diseases.  
2. Tropical middle‑income countries in Latin America that experience periodic mosquito‑borne outbreaks and occasionally get yellow‑fever notices (e.g., Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Venezuela, Colombia).  
3. Any country at Level 2 that was upgraded to Level 3 within 60 days over the past decade (non‑COVID THNs).

Class 1 is very broad; the baseline frequency of a Level 2→3 jump is extremely low.  
Class 2 captures Colombia’s epidemiological context better and has a higher (yet still small) upgrade rate.  
Class 3 directly matches the event we are forecasting (transition within ≈2 months) but data are sparse: in the last ten years the only clear Level 2→3 jumps for non‑COVID THNs were Marburg in Equatorial Guinea (2023) and Tanzania (2023), Ebola in DRC (2018/19), and polio in some countries—roughly 2–4 cases world‑wide per year.

I adopt reference class 3 (transition events within ∼60 days), adjusting for the tropical‑Latin‑American subset implied by class 2.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Remaining time to the judging date: 39 days (~5.5 weeks).  
Historical pattern: With only ≈3 non‑COVID Level 3 notices worldwide per year, the chance that one falls exactly in any given 39‑day window for any single country is very small. Extrapolating 3 events/year over 220 destinations gives a base probability of 3/220 = 1.4 % per 365 days; scaled to 39 days → 1.4 % × (39/365) ≈ 0.15 %.  
Colombia’s risk is somewhat higher than the global average because it sits in an endemic YF belt and has large dengue seasons. If we weight Colombia by a factor of 3–4 relative to the average destination (≈ the extra risk observed for Brazil or Peru vs. a temperate country), the baseline rises to ~0.5–0.6 % for the 39‑day window.

(d) Justification  
• Frequency: Empirically, non‑COVID Level 3 upgrades are rare, and none has been issued for Colombia in at least the last decade.  
• Trigger thresholds: Level 3 requires either (i) sustained urban transmission with significant public‑health impact or (ii) health‑system stress. The current yellow‑fever outbreak is severe (45 % CFR) but remains rural/peri‑urban; the CDC just issued a Level 2 notice on 15 Apr 2025. A second escalation within five weeks would require rapid urban spread or a dramatic case surge—possibilities, but historically unusual.  
• Seasonality: Yellow‑fever season will be tapering as Colombia enters the drier mid‑year period, making an explosive expansion less likely before 1 Jun 2025.  
• Political penalties: Level 3 carries economic consequences; the CDC is typically cautious and waits for clear evidence before upgrading large tourism destinations.  
• Market/expert expectations: No major travel‑medicine forums are currently flagging Colombia as “avoid non‑essential travel.” The U.S. State‑Dept security upgrade (Level 3) is unrelated to disease and does not force CDC alignment.

Putting these elements together, the outside (base‑rate) probability that the CDC bumps Colombia from Level 2 to Level 3 or 4 between now and 1 June 2025 sits well below 2 %.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: ≈0.15 % for an average country given the remaining 39 days.  
Adjustment for Colombia’s above‑average arboviral risk: ×4  → 0.6 %.  
Add a modest upward nudge (factor 1.3) because an outbreak already triggered a Level 2 notice last week, signalling the situation is “live.” 0.6 % × 1.3 ≈ 0.8 %.  
Round to the nearest 0.5 % for clarity → 1 %.

Outside View Prediction:
1 %

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Original CDC Travel Health Notice Context:**
   - Currently at "Level 2: Practice Enhanced Precautions" as of April 15, 2025
   - CDC issued this specific yellow fever alert for South America including Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru

2. **News Articles (April 16-23, 2025):**
   - Multiple reliable sources consistently report ~79 confirmed yellow fever cases and 36 deaths (45% mortality rate) since September 2024 in Colombia
   - Colombian Ministry of Health declared a national health emergency on April 17, 2025
   - Geographic spread documented across 9+ departments (Tolima most affected with 38 cases, 23 deaths)
   - Colombia implementing free vaccination for citizens and foreigners, with vaccination requirements for travelers
   - No reported urban transmission yet, which is epidemiologically significant
   - President Petro expressed concerns about climate change expanding mosquito ranges to higher elevations

3. **Regional Response Indicators:**
   - Ecuador and Costa Rica implementing border precautions and vaccination requirements
   - Colombian government requiring vaccination cards for certain travelers

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- Current CDC THN status is Level 2, only established 8 days ago (April 15)
- Extremely high case fatality rate (45%) substantially exceeds typical vector-borne disease outbreaks
- Colombia's official emergency declaration indicates government assessment of severe public health threat

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Geographic expansion from initial Tolima focus to 8+ other departments shows momentum
- No confirmed urban transmission yet, a key threshold for CDC escalation
- Colombia's responsive vaccination campaign may mitigate need for stricter travel warnings
- Regional countries implementing preventive measures rather than travel bans

**Weak Evidence:**
- President Petro's warnings about potential Bogotá spread (speculative)
- Climate change expanding mosquito ranges (longer-term concern than our timeframe)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is approximately 38 days (April 23 to June 1, 2025).

If halved (~19 days): Probability would decrease significantly (~5-8%) as institutional response would be unlikely without dramatic new developments.

If doubled (~76 days): Probability would increase moderately (~25-30%) as more infection cycles could occur, potentially reaching urban centers, and giving CDC more time to observe deterioration.

Yellow fever's 3-6 day incubation period allows for 6-12 transmission cycles within our timeframe, sufficient for significant escalation if containment fails.

## (d) Justification:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. The extremely high mortality rate (~45%) exceeds typical thresholds for severe concern
2. Geographic spread continues to accelerate (from 1 to 9+ departments)
3. Case counts are increasing faster than in previous year (more in Q1 2025 than all of 2024)
4. President's explicit warnings about potential spread to Bogotá suggest government concern about urban transmission
5. If urban transmission begins, probability would increase dramatically

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. CDC just elevated to Level 2 on April 15 (8 days ago), creating institutional hesitation to escalate again quickly
2. Yellow fever is vaccine-preventable, and Colombia is making vaccines freely available
3. Historical precedent suggests CDC requires urban transmission for Level 3 vector-borne disease notices
4. Colombia's aggressive response (emergency declaration, vaccination campaign, requirements for travelers) may mitigate need for stricter CDC warning
5. Absolute case numbers (79) remain relatively low for a nationwide epidemic

## Probability Calibration

For the CDC to raise Colombia to Level 3+ before June 1, we need:
1. Significant deterioration of the situation beyond current trends, likely requiring urban transmission
2. CDC determination that vaccination and enhanced precautions are insufficient protections
3. This determination to occur within a 38-day window, despite having just raised to Level 2

Looking at vector-borne disease outbreaks historically, CDC has typically raised to Level 3+ only when urban transmission is confirmed and cases are widespread in populated areas. Even during the 2016 Zika epidemic affecting Colombia, which caused significant international concern due to birth defects, the CDC maintained a Level 2 advisory.

Based on this evidence, I estimate:
- Probability of urban transmission occurring within timeframe: ~20%
- Probability of CDC escalating to Level 3+ if urban transmission occurs: ~70%
- Probability of CDC escalating without urban transmission: ~5%

Calculated: (0.20 × 0.70) + (0.80 × 0.05) = 0.14 + 0.04 = 0.18

Given the CDC's historical caution about Level 3 advisories and the recency of the Level 2 designation, I believe 16% is well-calibrated.

Checklist:
1. Predict if CDC raises Colombia's Travel Health Notice from Level 2 to Level 3+ before June 1, 2025
2. Base rate: CDC rarely elevates vector-borne disease notices without urban transmission
3. "16 out of 100 times, CDC would raise Colombia's THN above Level 2 before June 1"
4. Key evidence: 45% mortality rate, geographic expansion to 9+ departments, recent Level 2 designation, no urban transmission yet
5. Blind spot: Urban transmission begins in Bogotá within 2 weeks
6. Status quo favors remaining at Level 2 given recency of designation and institutional inertia

Probability: 16%
Predicted Probability: 16.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Vax-Before-Travel article (April 21, 2025)**: High-quality reporting on Colombia's yellow fever situation, with clear factual data (59 cases in Tolima, 74 total cases nationwide) and official statements from Colombia's government and the CDC.

2. **BBC article (April 17, 2025)**: Reputable international source reporting 74 confirmed cases with 34 deaths (46% fatality rate). Includes official statements from Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo and President Gustavo Petro.

3. **Colombia One article (April 23, 2025)**: Very recent local reporting on Colombia's vaccination efforts, including free vaccinations for foreigners, vaccination sites, and contraindications from medical authorities.

4. **CIDRAP article (April 16, 2025)**: High-quality epidemiological reporting confirming CDC's Level 2 Travel Health Notice issued April 15, covering South America including Colombia. Reports PAHO data of 131 cases/53 deaths regionwide in Q1 2025.

5. **Precision Vaccinations article (April 19, 2025)**: Details outbreak geography (9 departments affected) and confirms last urban outbreak was in 1929. Reports on government vaccination strategy expansion.

6. **AskNews articles (April 16-22, 2025)**: Multiple recent reports consistently showing: (1) case counts increasing to 79 cases/36 deaths, (2) Colombia's national health emergency declaration, (3) vaccination requirements for travelers, and (4) neighboring countries implementing precautionary measures.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong evidence**:
- CDC's current designation: CDC explicitly raised Colombia to Level 2 on April 15, 2025 (just 8 days ago) after evaluating the emerging situation.
- Case fatality rate: ~45-50% mortality consistently reported across multiple sources (BBC, MARCA, others).
- Geographic scope: Nine departments affected but primarily concentrated in rural Tolima (59 cases/23 deaths), with limited urban spread.

**Moderate evidence**:
- Vaccination response: Colombia implementing robust free vaccination program for citizens and foreigners (Colombia One, Vax-Before-Travel, Semana).
- International response: Neighboring countries implementing screening but not border closures (Ecuador, Costa Rica reports).
- CDC historical patterns: Limited information but sources suggest CDC generally requires substantial deterioration beyond "enhanced precautions" threshold for Level 3 designation.

**Weak evidence**:
- Climate change impacts: President Petro's claims about mosquitoes reaching higher elevations due to climate change (MARCA, BBC) - plausible but speculative regarding immediate impact.
- Historical precedent: No urban outbreak since 1929 (Precision Vaccinations) - historically reassuring but potentially not applicable given climate factors.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window spans 39 days (April 23 to June 1, 2025). This is significant because:
1. The CDC just raised the alert level to Level 2 on April 15 (8 days ago)
2. Colombia declared a health emergency on April 17 (6 days ago)
3. Cases appear to be increasing (from 74 to 79 in recent days)

If the timeframe were halved (~20 days), probability would decrease significantly (<5%) as there would be insufficient time to document substantial deterioration after a very recent Level 2 designation.

If the timeframe were doubled (~78 days), probability would increase moderately (perhaps 25-30%) as it would allow more time for potential urban spread, accumulated evidence of vaccination effectiveness/failure, and seasonal factors to emerge.

## (d) Justification:

Starting from a low base rate (CDC rarely escalates THNs to Level 3, especially for vector-borne diseases with limited spread), several factors warrant modest upward adjustment:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. Exceptionally high case fatality rate (~50%) compared to typical yellow fever outbreaks
2. Geographic spread to nine departments from initial concentration in Tolima
3. Colombia's unprecedented emergency declaration and international vaccination certificate requirements
4. Apparent continued case growth despite vaccination efforts

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. CDC only recently elevated to Level 2 (April 15), suggesting they would need substantial new evidence to justify further escalation
2. Limited urban transmission (still primarily rural/forested areas)
3. Colombia's aggressive vaccination campaign including for foreigners
4. Relatively small absolute case numbers (79) in a country of 50+ million people
5. No evidence of healthcare system strain in major cities

## Probability Calibration:

Starting with a low base rate (<10% based on CDC's historical reluctance to issue Level 3 THNs for vector-borne diseases), I adjust upward to 15% based primarily on the unusually high case fatality rate and the Colombian government's emergency declaration.

However, I resist going higher because:
1. The CDC would likely need dramatic deterioration beyond what triggered their Level 2 notice just 8 days ago
2. The evidence shows a robust vaccination and public health response
3. The outbreak remains predominantly rural despite some geographic spread
4. Absolute case numbers remain relatively low

## Checklist:
1. Will CDC raise Colombia's yellow fever Travel Health Notice from Level 2 to Level 3+ before June 1, 2025? Currently Level 2 since April 15.
2. Base rate: <10% given CDC's THN history for vector-borne diseases in Latin America.
3. 15 out of 100 times, CDC would raise Colombia's THN to Level 3 given current trajectories.
4. Key evidence: (1) 45-50% case fatality rate, (2) CDC just raised to Level 2 on April 15, (3) Primarily rural transmission, (4) Robust vaccination campaign.
5. Blind spot: Sudden explosion of cases in Bogotá or other major cities would change assessment entirely.
6. Status quo adjustment: 39-day window relatively short for another escalation after recent Level 2 classification.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question  
   “By June 1, 2025 (39 days from now), will the CDC elevate Colombia’s Travel Health Notice above Level 2 (i.e., to Level 3 or 4)?”

2. Source analysis  
   • NAFSA (Apr 2022): Describes CDC Travel Health Notice levels—Levels 1–4—and notes CDC raises notices for severe, spreading threats. Reliable, factual background.  
   • CIDRAP (Apr 15, 2025): Reports CDC just raised South America (including Colombia) to Level 2 for yellow fever, citing PAHO data (131 cases/53 deaths in Q1 2025 vs. 61/30 in all 2024). High‐quality, timely reporting.  
   • CIDRAP (Apr 18, 2025): Colombia declared a national yellow fever emergency (75 cases, 34 deaths since Sept 2024; spread to nine departments). Confirms no urban transmission yet but notes risk expansion. Reliable, domain‐expert source.  
   • Perplexity THN history (2025): Notes Colombia hasn’t had a Level 3 or 4 THN since at least 2020; outlines CDC’s vector‐borne escalation criteria (spread beyond endemic zones, urban transmission risk, health system strain). Analytical but fact‐based.  
   • Asknews summaries (Apr 21–23, 2025): Multiple local/regional outlets confirm 79 cases/36 deaths, yellow fever public health emergency, free mass vaccination (incl. at airport), and warnings by State Department. Quality varies but factual convergence.

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence  
   – Public health emergency declared, outbreak expanding beyond traditional zones (CIDRAP, Asknews)  
   – High case fatality rate (~45%), credible statistics across sources  
   Moderate evidence  
   – CDC just evaluated and set Level 2 on Apr 15; would need significant new evidence to upgrade  
   – Geographical spread edging toward urban periphery but no confirmed urban transmission  
   – Mass vaccination underway, likely slowing spread  
   Weak evidence  
   – Security advisories and regional precautions (Ecuador, Costa Rica) have no direct bearing on CDC health notices  
   – Anecdotal traveler‐level compliance comments

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – Forecast window: 39 days (Apr 23–Jun 1, 2025).  
   – Half the time (~20 days): less runway for outbreak to worsen → lower upgrade probability.  
   – Double time (~78 days): more time for urban spillover or healthcare strain → higher upgrade probability.

5. Justification & inside‑view adjustment  
   Base rate: Colombia hasn’t reached CDC Level 3 for vector‐borne threats in recent history (0/ at least five years). That suggests a low baseline (<20%).  
   Upside factors (+)  
   – Ongoing outbreak severity (75–79 cases, 34–36 deaths; 45% CFR) and geographic expansion beyond endemic zones.  
   – Public health emergency signals serious government concern, likely to draw CDC attention.  
   – Seasonal trends could heighten transmission.  
   Downside factors (–)  
   – CDC just assessed and chose Level 2 on Apr 15, indicating criteria for Level 3 not yet met.  
   – No confirmed urban transmission or healthcare system overload.  
   – Aggressive vaccination rollout may contain spread quickly.  
   – CDC historically conservative in raising vector‐borne THNs.

   Balancing these, I move modestly upward from a 15% naïve base rate to ~27%: enough runway for further spread but significant containment and CDC caution weigh against.

Probability calibration  
Given a 39-day window, I estimate there's roughly a 1-in-4 chance an outbreak escalation (e.g., urban cases or healthcare strain) triggers a CDC Level 3 or 4 notice.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase (<30 words): ✓  
2. Base rate stated: ✓  
3. Consistency: “27% out of 100 times, CDC raises above Level 2 by Jun 1.” ✓

   a. CDC set Level 2 on Apr 15 (moderate)  
   b. Public health emergency, outbreak growing (strong)  
   c. No urban transmission yet (moderate)  
   d. Vaccination campaigns ramping up (moderate)  
   e. Historical CDC conservatism (moderate)

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question  
“Will the CDC raise Colombia’s Travel Health Notice status above Level 2 by June 1, 2025? Today is April 23, 2025—39 days remain.”

2. Outside‐view base rate  
Over the past five years, CDC has issued zero Level 3+ Travel Health Notices for yellow fever or other vector‑borne diseases in South America, despite multiple outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2018). Empirical rate ≈0%. To allow for unprecedented severity or institutional surprise, I set an uninformed base‐rate “shock floor” of 1% and ceiling of 10%, midpoint ≈5%.

3. Source analysis  
• CDC THN system (NAFSA, Apr 2022): High‑quality summary of CDC’s four‐level criteria. Factual, minimal opinion.  
• Cidrap on CDC Level 2 for South America (Apr 16 2025): High‑quality reporting of CDC’s decision to issue Level 2 YF notice. Reliable.  
• U.S. State Dept travel advisory (Apr 19 2025): Medium‑high quality for security risk; indirectly relevant to health notice.  
• Colombian National Health Emergency declarations (multiple reputable outlets, Apr 17–23 2025): High‑quality official data on YF case counts (75–79 cases, 34–36 deaths), high CFR (~45%), geographic spread, free mass vaccination.  
• AI‐generated THN escalation history: Low‑quality, useful check but not definitive without primary docs.

4. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
• Historical CDC practice: zero Level 3+ THNs for yellow fever in comparable outbreaks (strong → keeps probability near floor).  
• Institutional criteria: CDC’s published guidance shows Level 2 suffices unless urban transmission or health-system collapse (strong → status quo likely).  

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
• Unusually high CFR and geographic spread into coffee regions—could trigger reconsideration (moderate → small upward adjustment).  
• Colombian declaration of health emergency and proof‑of‑vaccine requirements at ports (moderate → shows seriousness but also shows control measures, likely forestalling CDC escalation).  

Weak evidence (small shifts):  
• Neighboring countries tightening vaccine entry rules (Ecuador, Costa Rica): indicates regional concern but not directly CDC’s mandate (weak).  
• Short supply of YF‑VAX boosters in some U.S. clinics (anecdotal): negligible effect.  

5. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 39 days.  
• If window halved (~20 days): CDC review cycles might not complete, probability falls to ~2%.  
• If window doubled (~80 days): room for another surge or urban spillover, probability rises to ~8%.

6. Justification of inside‐view adjustments  
Start at base-rate 5%.  
• –3 pts for strong institutional inertia and lack of precedent (historical zero Level 3+ events; CDC has already judged Level 2 adequate).  
• +1 pt for outbreak severity/CFR and potential for urban transmission if Aedes range expands (still remote, but nonzero).  
Net adjustment: –2 pts → 3%.

7. Final inside‐view prediction  
Given CDC’s track record, current evidence, and limited time for additional worsening, I assign a 3% chance that CDC will elevate Colombia’s Travel Health Notice above Level 2 by June 1, 2025.

Probability calibration  
I believe I’ve anchored to the outside‐view base rate (0% historical, shock floor 1–10%) and made a modest inside adjustment for current severity. A 3% probability reflects a rare but plausible institutional surprise.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: ✓  
2. Base rate stated: 0% historical, shock floor 1–10%, midpoint ≈5%: ✓  
3. Consistency: “3 times out of 100” CDC issues Level 3+ by June 1 fits rationale.  
4. Top evidence:  
   a) 0 prior yellow-fever Level 3+ events (strong)  
   b) CDC criteria favor Level 2 absent urban spread (strong)  
   c) High CFR & emergency → small risk of escalation (moderate)  
   d) Only 39 days for new data (moderate)  
5. Blind‐spot: A sudden urban outbreak in Bogotá (or discovery of urban transmission) could force CDC to Level 3 swiftly—would raise probability significantly.  
6. Status quo: Outbreak under control with ongoing vaccination; status quo (Level 2) remains most likely.

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• CDC country page (accessed 23 Apr 2025). Primary source; shows Colombia at non‑COVID Travel Health Notice (THN) Level 2. Purely factual, highest reliability.  
• CIDRAP 16 Apr 2025. University of Minnesota infectious‑disease newswire; reports CDC’s 15 Apr Level 2 yellow‑fever notice for most of South America. Factual quotes from CDC/PAHO; high quality.  
• BBC 17 Apr 2025 & large Spanish‑language press‑run (Semana, El Espectador, Marca, RFI, etc.). Describe Colombian yellow‑fever emergency (≈79 cases, 36 deaths, national vaccination campaign). All quoting Colombian MoH or President Petro. Multiple independent outlets; high factual concordance; moderate‑to‑high reliability. Opinions limited to officials’ statements.  
• Vax‑before‑Travel / PrecisionVaccinations 19–23 Apr 2025. Trade site focused on travel shots; summarises MoH resolutions and free‑vaccine availability. Factual; moderate reliability.  
• No article cites CDC even considering a Level 3. Last CDC action was the Level 2 notice (15 Apr).

(b) Evidence analysis (re: upgrade to > Level 2 before 1 Jun 2025)  
Strong evidence  
• Historical CDC behaviour: Level 3 notices are rare (≈3 non‑COVID events/yr), typically reserved for Ebola/Marburg‑class crises without good counter‑measures.  
• Existence of safe, widely available YF vaccine → risk can be mitigated; structural reason CDC usually stays at Level 2.  
Moderate evidence  
• Current outbreak officially a “national health emergency” with high CFR and geographic spread; several neighbours tightening border rules.  
• CDC only just issued a Level 2 (15 Apr) → confirms risk is live but also indicates staff judged Level 2 adequate.  
Weak evidence  
• Climate‑driven mosquito range shift; speculative risk of rapid urban transmission in Bogotá.  
• Short‑term political pressure inside Colombia; scant impact on CDC decisions.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Days until the resolution check: 39.  
• Doubling window to 78 days would modestly raise probability (more time for urban spread & CDC action) by roughly ×1.5.  
• Halving to ~20 days would cut probability roughly in half because CDC rarely re‑issues a fresh THN within a month of the previous one.

(d) Justification / inside‑view adjustments  
Outside‑view base (global average) for any one destination moving L2→L3 in a 39‑day window ≈0.15 %.  
+ Colombia’s arboviral risk (×4)  → 0.6 %.  
+ Active outbreak & recent emergency declaration (×1.5)  → 0.9 %.  
+ Multiple independent reports of unusually high CFR, cross‑border concern (×1.3) → 1.2 %.  
‑ Availability of vaccine, CDC’s conservative escalation history for YF (÷0.6) → 0.7 %.  
Round upward slightly for tail‑risk of sudden urban amplification or second pathogen (e.g., dengue/H5N1)  → final ≈3 %.

Probability calibration
My inside‑view estimate: there is roughly a 3 % chance the CDC will raise Colombia’s Travel Health Notice above Level 2 (to Level 3 or 4) before 1 June 2025. I am 80 % confident the true probability lies between 1 % and 7 %. A ±10 % absolute change in this probability (to −7 % / +13 %) would conflict with historic upgrade frequencies (too high) or ignore present outbreak signals (too low).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “By 1 Jun 2025, will CDC list Colombia THN at Level 3/4 (>2)?”  
2. Base rate: 0.15 % per 39 days for average country; rooted analysis above.  
3. Consistency: “3 of 100 times, Colombia would be ≥Level 3 by 1 Jun 2025.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Level 2 issued 15 Apr; b) YF vaccine effective/widely available; c) only 79 cases so far; d) Level 3 historically used for non‑vaccine diseases; e) 39‑day window short.  
5. Blind‑spot: explosive urban outbreak (e.g., Bogotá 100+ cases) within weeks causing CDC to react faster than precedent. Would push probability toward ~20 %.  
6. Status‑quo bias: retention at Level 2 is default and aligns with most prior mosquito‑borne outbreaks.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Original CDC Travel Health Notice Context:**
   - Currently at "Level 2: Practice Enhanced Precautions" as of April 15, 2025
   - CDC issued this specific yellow fever alert for South America including Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru

2. **News Articles (April 16-23, 2025):**
   - Multiple reliable sources consistently report ~79 confirmed yellow fever cases and 36 deaths (45% mortality rate) since September 2024 in Colombia
   - Colombian Ministry of Health declared a national health emergency on April 17, 2025
   - Geographic spread documented across 9+ departments (Tolima most affected with 38 cases, 23 deaths)
   - Colombia implementing free vaccination for citizens and foreigners, with vaccination requirements for travelers
   - No reported urban transmission yet, which is epidemiologically significant
   - President Petro expressed concerns about climate change expanding mosquito ranges to higher elevations

3. **Regional Response Indicators:**
   - Ecuador and Costa Rica implementing border precautions and vaccination requirements
   - Colombian government requiring vaccination cards for certain travelers

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- Current CDC THN status is Level 2, only established 8 days ago (April 15)
- Extremely high case fatality rate (45%) substantially exceeds typical vector-borne disease outbreaks
- Colombia's official emergency declaration indicates government assessment of severe public health threat

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Geographic expansion from initial Tolima focus to 8+ other departments shows momentum
- No confirmed urban transmission yet, a key threshold for CDC escalation
- Colombia's responsive vaccination campaign may mitigate need for stricter travel warnings
- Regional countries implementing preventive measures rather than travel bans

**Weak Evidence:**
- President Petro's warnings about potential Bogotá spread (speculative)
- Climate change expanding mosquito ranges (longer-term concern than our timeframe)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is approximately 38 days (April 23 to June 1, 2025).

If halved (~19 days): Probability would decrease significantly (~5-8%) as institutional response would be unlikely without dramatic new developments.

If doubled (~76 days): Probability would increase moderately (~25-30%) as more infection cycles could occur, potentially reaching urban centers, and giving CDC more time to observe deterioration.

Yellow fever's 3-6 day incubation period allows for 6-12 transmission cycles within our timeframe, sufficient for significant escalation if containment fails.

## (d) Justification:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. The extremely high mortality rate (~45%) exceeds typical thresholds for severe concern
2. Geographic spread continues to accelerate (from 1 to 9+ departments)
3. Case counts are increasing faster than in previous year (more in Q1 2025 than all of 2024)
4. President's explicit warnings about potential spread to Bogotá suggest government concern about urban transmission
5. If urban transmission begins, probability would increase dramatically

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. CDC just elevated to Level 2 on April 15 (8 days ago), creating institutional hesitation to escalate again quickly
2. Yellow fever is vaccine-preventable, and Colombia is making vaccines freely available
3. Historical precedent suggests CDC requires urban transmission for Level 3 vector-borne disease notices
4. Colombia's aggressive response (emergency declaration, vaccination campaign, requirements for travelers) may mitigate need for stricter CDC warning
5. Absolute case numbers (79) remain relatively low for a nationwide epidemic

## Probability Calibration

For the CDC to raise Colombia to Level 3+ before June 1, we need:
1. Significant deterioration of the situation beyond current trends, likely requiring urban transmission
2. CDC determination that vaccination and enhanced precautions are insufficient protections
3. This determination to occur within a 38-day window, despite having just raised to Level 2

Looking at vector-borne disease outbreaks historically, CDC has typically raised to Level 3+ only when urban transmission is confirmed and cases are widespread in populated areas. Even during the 2016 Zika epidemic affecting Colombia, which caused significant international concern due to birth defects, the CDC maintained a Level 2 advisory.

Based on this evidence, I estimate:
- Probability of urban transmission occurring within timeframe: ~20%
- Probability of CDC escalating to Level 3+ if urban transmission occurs: ~70%
- Probability of CDC escalating without urban transmission: ~5%

Calculated: (0.20 × 0.70) + (0.80 × 0.05) = 0.14 + 0.04 = 0.18

Given the CDC's historical caution about Level 3 advisories and the recency of the Level 2 designation, I believe 16% is well-calibrated.

Checklist:
1. Predict if CDC raises Colombia's Travel Health Notice from Level 2 to Level 3+ before June 1, 2025
2. Base rate: CDC rarely elevates vector-borne disease notices without urban transmission
3. "16 out of 100 times, CDC would raise Colombia's THN above Level 2 before June 1"
4. Key evidence: 45% mortality rate, geographic expansion to 9+ departments, recent Level 2 designation, no urban transmission yet
5. Blind spot: Urban transmission begins in Bogotá within 2 weeks
6. Status quo favors remaining at Level 2 given recency of designation and institutional inertia

Probability: 16%
Predicted Probability: 16.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Vax-Before-Travel article (April 21, 2025)**: High-quality reporting on Colombia's yellow fever situation, with clear factual data (59 cases in Tolima, 74 total cases nationwide) and official statements from Colombia's government and the CDC.

2. **BBC article (April 17, 2025)**: Reputable international source reporting 74 confirmed cases with 34 deaths (46% fatality rate). Includes official statements from Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo and President Gustavo Petro.

3. **Colombia One article (April 23, 2025)**: Very recent local reporting on Colombia's vaccination efforts, including free vaccinations for foreigners, vaccination sites, and contraindications from medical authorities.

4. **CIDRAP article (April 16, 2025)**: High-quality epidemiological reporting confirming CDC's Level 2 Travel Health Notice issued April 15, covering South America including Colombia. Reports PAHO data of 131 cases/53 deaths regionwide in Q1 2025.

5. **Precision Vaccinations article (April 19, 2025)**: Details outbreak geography (9 departments affected) and confirms last urban outbreak was in 1929. Reports on government vaccination strategy expansion.

6. **AskNews articles (April 16-22, 2025)**: Multiple recent reports consistently showing: (1) case counts increasing to 79 cases/36 deaths, (2) Colombia's national health emergency declaration, (3) vaccination requirements for travelers, and (4) neighboring countries implementing precautionary measures.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong evidence**:
- CDC's current designation: CDC explicitly raised Colombia to Level 2 on April 15, 2025 (just 8 days ago) after evaluating the emerging situation.
- Case fatality rate: ~45-50% mortality consistently reported across multiple sources (BBC, MARCA, others).
- Geographic scope: Nine departments affected but primarily concentrated in rural Tolima (59 cases/23 deaths), with limited urban spread.

**Moderate evidence**:
- Vaccination response: Colombia implementing robust free vaccination program for citizens and foreigners (Colombia One, Vax-Before-Travel, Semana).
- International response: Neighboring countries implementing screening but not border closures (Ecuador, Costa Rica reports).
- CDC historical patterns: Limited information but sources suggest CDC generally requires substantial deterioration beyond "enhanced precautions" threshold for Level 3 designation.

**Weak evidence**:
- Climate change impacts: President Petro's claims about mosquitoes reaching higher elevations due to climate change (MARCA, BBC) - plausible but speculative regarding immediate impact.
- Historical precedent: No urban outbreak since 1929 (Precision Vaccinations) - historically reassuring but potentially not applicable given climate factors.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window spans 39 days (April 23 to June 1, 2025). This is significant because:
1. The CDC just raised the alert level to Level 2 on April 15 (8 days ago)
2. Colombia declared a health emergency on April 17 (6 days ago)
3. Cases appear to be increasing (from 74 to 79 in recent days)

If the timeframe were halved (~20 days), probability would decrease significantly (<5%) as there would be insufficient time to document substantial deterioration after a very recent Level 2 designation.

If the timeframe were doubled (~78 days), probability would increase moderately (perhaps 25-30%) as it would allow more time for potential urban spread, accumulated evidence of vaccination effectiveness/failure, and seasonal factors to emerge.

## (d) Justification:

Starting from a low base rate (CDC rarely escalates THNs to Level 3, especially for vector-borne diseases with limited spread), several factors warrant modest upward adjustment:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. Exceptionally high case fatality rate (~50%) compared to typical yellow fever outbreaks
2. Geographic spread to nine departments from initial concentration in Tolima
3. Colombia's unprecedented emergency declaration and international vaccination certificate requirements
4. Apparent continued case growth despite vaccination efforts

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. CDC only recently elevated to Level 2 (April 15), suggesting they would need substantial new evidence to justify further escalation
2. Limited urban transmission (still primarily rural/forested areas)
3. Colombia's aggressive vaccination campaign including for foreigners
4. Relatively small absolute case numbers (79) in a country of 50+ million people
5. No evidence of healthcare system strain in major cities

## Probability Calibration:

Starting with a low base rate (<10% based on CDC's historical reluctance to issue Level 3 THNs for vector-borne diseases), I adjust upward to 15% based primarily on the unusually high case fatality rate and the Colombian government's emergency declaration.

However, I resist going higher because:
1. The CDC would likely need dramatic deterioration beyond what triggered their Level 2 notice just 8 days ago
2. The evidence shows a robust vaccination and public health response
3. The outbreak remains predominantly rural despite some geographic spread
4. Absolute case numbers remain relatively low

## Checklist:
1. Will CDC raise Colombia's yellow fever Travel Health Notice from Level 2 to Level 3+ before June 1, 2025? Currently Level 2 since April 15.
2. Base rate: <10% given CDC's THN history for vector-borne diseases in Latin America.
3. 15 out of 100 times, CDC would raise Colombia's THN to Level 3 given current trajectories.
4. Key evidence: (1) 45-50% case fatality rate, (2) CDC just raised to Level 2 on April 15, (3) Primarily rural transmission, (4) Robust vaccination campaign.
5. Blind spot: Sudden explosion of cases in Bogotá or other major cities would change assessment entirely.
6. Status quo adjustment: 39-day window relatively short for another escalation after recent Level 2 classification.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question  
   “By June 1, 2025 (39 days from now), will the CDC elevate Colombia’s Travel Health Notice above Level 2 (i.e., to Level 3 or 4)?”

2. Source analysis  
   • NAFSA (Apr 2022): Describes CDC Travel Health Notice levels—Levels 1–4—and notes CDC raises notices for severe, spreading threats. Reliable, factual background.  
   • CIDRAP (Apr 15, 2025): Reports CDC just raised South America (including Colombia) to Level 2 for yellow fever, citing PAHO data (131 cases/53 deaths in Q1 2025 vs. 61/30 in all 2024). High‐quality, timely reporting.  
   • CIDRAP (Apr 18, 2025): Colombia declared a national yellow fever emergency (75 cases, 34 deaths since Sept 2024; spread to nine departments). Confirms no urban transmission yet but notes risk expansion. Reliable, domain‐expert source.  
   • Perplexity THN history (2025): Notes Colombia hasn’t had a Level 3 or 4 THN since at least 2020; outlines CDC’s vector‐borne escalation criteria (spread beyond endemic zones, urban transmission risk, health system strain). Analytical but fact‐based.  
   • Asknews summaries (Apr 21–23, 2025): Multiple local/regional outlets confirm 79 cases/36 deaths, yellow fever public health emergency, free mass vaccination (incl. at airport), and warnings by State Department. Quality varies but factual convergence.

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence  
   – Public health emergency declared, outbreak expanding beyond traditional zones (CIDRAP, Asknews)  
   – High case fatality rate (~45%), credible statistics across sources  
   Moderate evidence  
   – CDC just evaluated and set Level 2 on Apr 15; would need significant new evidence to upgrade  
   – Geographical spread edging toward urban periphery but no confirmed urban transmission  
   – Mass vaccination underway, likely slowing spread  
   Weak evidence  
   – Security advisories and regional precautions (Ecuador, Costa Rica) have no direct bearing on CDC health notices  
   – Anecdotal traveler‐level compliance comments

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – Forecast window: 39 days (Apr 23–Jun 1, 2025).  
   – Half the time (~20 days): less runway for outbreak to worsen → lower upgrade probability.  
   – Double time (~78 days): more time for urban spillover or healthcare strain → higher upgrade probability.

5. Justification & inside‑view adjustment  
   Base rate: Colombia hasn’t reached CDC Level 3 for vector‐borne threats in recent history (0/ at least five years). That suggests a low baseline (<20%).  
   Upside factors (+)  
   – Ongoing outbreak severity (75–79 cases, 34–36 deaths; 45% CFR) and geographic expansion beyond endemic zones.  
   – Public health emergency signals serious government concern, likely to draw CDC attention.  
   – Seasonal trends could heighten transmission.  
   Downside factors (–)  
   – CDC just assessed and chose Level 2 on Apr 15, indicating criteria for Level 3 not yet met.  
   – No confirmed urban transmission or healthcare system overload.  
   – Aggressive vaccination rollout may contain spread quickly.  
   – CDC historically conservative in raising vector‐borne THNs.

   Balancing these, I move modestly upward from a 15% naïve base rate to ~27%: enough runway for further spread but significant containment and CDC caution weigh against.

Probability calibration  
Given a 39-day window, I estimate there's roughly a 1-in-4 chance an outbreak escalation (e.g., urban cases or healthcare strain) triggers a CDC Level 3 or 4 notice.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase (<30 words): ✓  
2. Base rate stated: ✓  
3. Consistency: “27% out of 100 times, CDC raises above Level 2 by Jun 1.” ✓  
4. Top evidence (≤5, <20 words each):  
   a. CDC set Level 2 on Apr 15 (moderate)  
   b. Public health emergency, outbreak growing (strong)  
   c. No urban transmission yet (moderate)  
   d. Vaccination campaigns ramping up (moderate)  
   e. Historical CDC conservatism (moderate)  
5. Blind spot: Sudden urban cluster emerges → rapid CDC upgrade  
6. Status quo bias: CDC remains at Level 2

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question  
“Will the CDC raise Colombia’s Travel Health Notice status above Level 2 by June 1, 2025? Today is April 23, 2025—39 days remain.”

2. Outside‐view base rate  
Over the past five years, CDC has issued zero Level 3+ Travel Health Notices for yellow fever or other vector‑borne diseases in South America, despite multiple outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2018). Empirical rate ≈0%. To allow for unprecedented severity or institutional surprise, I set an uninformed base‐rate “shock floor” of 1% and ceiling of 10%, midpoint ≈5%.

3. Source analysis  
• CDC THN system (NAFSA, Apr 2022): High‑quality summary of CDC’s four‐level criteria. Factual, minimal opinion.  
• Cidrap on CDC Level 2 for South America (Apr 16 2025): High‑quality reporting of CDC’s decision to issue Level 2 YF notice. Reliable.  
• U.S. State Dept travel advisory (Apr 19 2025): Medium‑high quality for security risk; indirectly relevant to health notice.  
• Colombian National Health Emergency declarations (multiple reputable outlets, Apr 17–23 2025): High‑quality official data on YF case counts (75–79 cases, 34–36 deaths), high CFR (~45%), geographic spread, free mass vaccination.  
• AI‐generated THN escalation history: Low‑quality, useful check but not definitive without primary docs.

4. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
• Historical CDC practice: zero Level 3+ THNs for yellow fever in comparable outbreaks (strong → keeps probability near floor).  
• Institutional criteria: CDC’s published guidance shows Level 2 suffices unless urban transmission or health-system collapse (strong → status quo likely).  

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
• Unusually high CFR and geographic spread into coffee regions—could trigger reconsideration (moderate → small upward adjustment).  
• Colombian declaration of health emergency and proof‑of‑vaccine requirements at ports (moderate → shows seriousness but also shows control measures, likely forestalling CDC escalation).  

Weak evidence (small shifts):  
• Neighboring countries tightening vaccine entry rules (Ecuador, Costa Rica): indicates regional concern but not directly CDC’s mandate (weak).  
• Short supply of YF‑VAX boosters in some U.S. clinics (anecdotal): negligible effect.  

5. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 39 days.  
• If window halved (~20 days): CDC review cycles might not complete, probability falls to ~2%.  
• If window doubled (~80 days): room for another surge or urban spillover, probability rises to ~8%.

6. Justification of inside‐view adjustments  
Start at base-rate 5%.  
• –3 pts for strong institutional inertia and lack of precedent (historical zero Level 3+ events; CDC has already judged Level 2 adequate).  
• +1 pt for outbreak severity/CFR and potential for urban transmission if Aedes range expands (still remote, but nonzero).  
Net adjustment: –2 pts → 3%.

7. Final inside‐view prediction  
Given CDC’s track record, current evidence, and limited time for additional worsening, I assign a 3% chance that CDC will elevate Colombia’s Travel Health Notice above Level 2 by June 1, 2025.

Probability calibration  
I believe I’ve anchored to the outside‐view base rate (0% historical, shock floor 1–10%) and made a modest inside adjustment for current severity. A 3% probability reflects a rare but plausible institutional surprise.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: ✓  
2. Base rate stated: 0% historical, shock floor 1–10%, midpoint ≈5%: ✓  
3. Consistency: “3 times out of 100” CDC issues Level 3+ by June 1 fits rationale.  
4. Top evidence:  
   a) 0 prior yellow-fever Level 3+ events (strong)  
   b) CDC criteria favor Level 2 absent urban spread (strong)  
   c) High CFR & emergency → small risk of escalation (moderate)  
   d) Only 39 days for new data (moderate)  
5. Blind‐spot: A sudden urban outbreak in Bogotá (or discovery of urban transmission) could force CDC to Level 3 swiftly—would raise probability significantly.  
6. Status quo: Outbreak under control with ongoing vaccination; status quo (Level 2) remains most likely.

Probability: 3%
Predicted Probability: 3.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• CDC country page (accessed 23 Apr 2025). Primary source; shows Colombia at non‑COVID Travel Health Notice (THN) Level 2. Purely factual, highest reliability.  
• CIDRAP 16 Apr 2025. University of Minnesota infectious‑disease newswire; reports CDC’s 15 Apr Level 2 yellow‑fever notice for most of South America. Factual quotes from CDC/PAHO; high quality.  
• BBC 17 Apr 2025 & large Spanish‑language press‑run (Semana, El Espectador, Marca, RFI, etc.). Describe Colombian yellow‑fever emergency (≈79 cases, 36 deaths, national vaccination campaign). All quoting Colombian MoH or President Petro. Multiple independent outlets; high factual concordance; moderate‑to‑high reliability. Opinions limited to officials’ statements.  
• Vax‑before‑Travel / PrecisionVaccinations 19–23 Apr 2025. Trade site focused on travel shots; summarises MoH resolutions and free‑vaccine availability. Factual; moderate reliability.  
• No article cites CDC even considering a Level 3. Last CDC action was the Level 2 notice (15 Apr).

(b) Evidence analysis (re: upgrade to > Level 2 before 1 Jun 2025)  
Strong evidence  
• Historical CDC behaviour: Level 3 notices are rare (≈3 non‑COVID events/yr), typically reserved for Ebola/Marburg‑class crises without good counter‑measures.  
• Existence of safe, widely available YF vaccine → risk can be mitigated; structural reason CDC usually stays at Level 2.  
Moderate evidence  
• Current outbreak officially a “national health emergency” with high CFR and geographic spread; several neighbours tightening border rules.  
• CDC only just issued a Level 2 (15 Apr) → confirms risk is live but also indicates staff judged Level 2 adequate.  
Weak evidence  
• Climate‑driven mosquito range shift; speculative risk of rapid urban transmission in Bogotá.  
• Short‑term political pressure inside Colombia; scant impact on CDC decisions.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Days until the resolution check: 39.  
• Doubling window to 78 days would modestly raise probability (more time for urban spread & CDC action) by roughly ×1.5.  
• Halving to ~20 days would cut probability roughly in half because CDC rarely re‑issues a fresh THN within a month of the previous one.

(d) Justification / inside‑view adjustments  
Outside‑view base (global average) for any one destination moving L2→L3 in a 39‑day window ≈0.15 %.  
+ Colombia’s arboviral risk (×4)  → 0.6 %.  
+ Active outbreak & recent emergency declaration (×1.5)  → 0.9 %.  
+ Multiple independent reports of unusually high CFR, cross‑border concern (×1.3) → 1.2 %.  
‑ Availability of vaccine, CDC’s conservative escalation history for YF (÷0.6) → 0.7 %.  
Round upward slightly for tail‑risk of sudden urban amplification or second pathogen (e.g., dengue/H5N1)  → final ≈3 %.

Probability calibration
My inside‑view estimate: there is roughly a 3 % chance the CDC will raise Colombia’s Travel Health Notice above Level 2 (to Level 3 or 4) before 1 June 2025. I am 80 % confident the true probability lies between 1 % and 7 %. A ±10 % absolute change in this probability (to −7 % / +13 %) would conflict with historic upgrade frequencies (too high) or ignore present outbreak signals (too low).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “By 1 Jun 2025, will CDC list Colombia THN at Level 3/4 (>2)?”  
2. Base rate: 0.15 % per 39 days for average country; rooted analysis above.  
3. Consistency: “3 of 100 times, Colombia would be ≥Level 3 by 1 Jun 2025.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Level 2 issued 15 Apr; b) YF vaccine effective/widely available; c) only 79 cases so far; d) Level 3 historically used for non‑vaccine diseases; e) 39‑day window short.  
5. Blind‑spot: explosive urban outbreak (e.g., Bogotá 100+ cases) within weeks causing CDC to react faster than precedent. Would push probability toward ~20 %.  
6. Status‑quo bias: retention at Level 2 is default and aligns with most prior mosquito‑borne outbreaks.

Probability: 3%
Predicted Probability: 3.0%...
