Historical output: Analysis:
The PAP has held a supermajority (>66.7%) of elected seats in every election since 1968. To form an out‑view baseline, I need the seat counts and total seats for each election from 1968 to 2020 to compute historical seat‑share trends—especially noting the slight decline from ~93% in 2011 to ~89–93% in 2020. Key sub‑questions: How many seats were contested each cycle? What share did PAP win? Has the rate of change accelerated or plateaued? Recent changes in electoral boundaries, the rise of opposition in GRCs (e.g., Sengkang, Aljunied), and any new GRC groupings could sway a few seats. Gathering a complete table of historical seat shares will anchor the base rate before applying the inside view adjustments for voter sentiment and boundary changes ahead of the 2025 election.

Disclaimer: The text provided appears to be the CFR homepage navigation plus an excerpt from an academic webinar on oil geopolitics—not the intended article on Singapore’s election. Below is a summary only of the oil‑geopolitics content given.

Summary:

• Speaker and setting  
  – Carolyn Kissane, clinical professor at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs and CFR member, joins CFR moderator Irina Faskianos in an on‑the‑record webinar.  
  – Topic: recent shifts in the geopolitics of oil, especially since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

• Key facts and figures  
  – World oil consumption exceeds 100 million barrels per day (bpd).  
  – Demand is rising, notably in Asia, and may grow further as China’s economy fully reopens.  
  – Despite recessionary pressures in some economies, global demand has not yet fallen.

• OPEC+ production cut  
  – Late‑January 2025: OPEC+ unexpectedly agreed to cut output by 1.2 million bpd.  
  – Saudi Arabia and other core producers appear to have driven the decision to support prices.  
  – Oil prices jumped to around US $80+/barrel following the announcement.

• Implications and uncertainties  
  – Higher oil prices raise the risk of renewed energy‑driven inflation amid fragile global growth.  
  – The cuts come at a time of already tight supply, surprising many long‑term analysts.  
  – Broader concerns include energy security, the pace of the low‑carbon transition, and how sustained higher prices will affect both oil‑importing economies and investment in alternatives.

• Broader context  
  – Russia remains one of the world’s top three oil producers; its war in Ukraine has prompted major realignments in supply routes and energy security strategies.  
  – The tension between steady or rising oil demand and the longer‑term push to decarbonize underpins much of today’s energy‑security debate.

<Summary source="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/ge2025-pap-refresh-team-over-30-new-candidates-no-target-vote-share">
Here’s a concise summary of the Business Times article by Sharanya Pillai (Apr 12):

Facts & figures  
• PAP will field “more than 30” new candidates at GE 2025—the largest slate of fresh faces in recent history.  
• GE 2025 will see 18 GRCs and 15 SMCs (up from 17 GRCs/14 SMCs), for a total of 97 elected seats (vs. 93 in 2020).  
• Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC (4‑member team) remains unchanged: PM Lawrence Wong (Limbang), Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad (Marsiling), North West District Mayor Alex Yam (Yew Tee) and lawyer Hany Soh (Woodgrove).  
• In GE 2020, this team won Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC with 63.18% of valid votes (vs. 68.73% in 2015).  
• The Singapore Democratic Party plans to contest Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC, adjacent Sembawang GRC and the new Sembawang West SMC (“Northern strategy”).

Key statements by PM Lawrence Wong  
• Renewal is urgent—each delay makes future refresh slower and harder, and Singaporeans expect it.  
• With global uncertainty (recession risks, jobs impact, unravelling rules‑based order), “who you have in the cockpit matters.”  
• PAP will make its case on the last five years and the “Forward Singapore” agenda but has no “target vote share in mind” and expects a “fierce contest.”  
• Wong will lead the party into the election and treats every contest seriously, including in his own GRC.  

Context  
• GE 2025 must be held by 23 November 2025; exact polling date not yet set.  
• Article focuses on PAP’s renewal strategy and campaign positioning, without opinion‑poll data (polling is banned during campaign).  

No target vote‑share has been stated, but the PAP is clearly emphasizing renewal and preparing for a closely fought election amid global headwinds.

Query: List PAP seats won, total seats, and seat‑share percentage for each Singapore general election from 1968 to 2020
# Analysis of People's Action Party Performance in Singapore General Elections (1968–2020)  

The People’s Action Party (PAP) has dominated Singapore’s political landscape since independence, winning supermajorities in every general election. This report examines the PAP’s electoral performance from 1968 to 2020, detailing the number of seats won, total seats contested, and seat-share percentages. The analysis is grounded in historical records and electoral data, with citations to primary sources.  

---

## Electoral Dominance in the Early Years (1968–1980)  

The PAP’s hegemony began in **1968**, the first general election after Singapore’s independence. The party secured all **58 seats** uncontested, marking a 100% seat share[1][2]. This landslide victory set the precedent for one-party dominance, reinforced by the absence of credible opposition challenges.  

In **1972**, the PAP repeated this feat, winning all **65 seats** contested. The election saw a 93.55% voter turnout, with the PAP capturing 70.4% of the popular vote[10]. By **1976**, the party expanded its parliamentary presence to **69 seats**, again uncontested, maintaining a 100% seat share despite a slight dip in its vote margin[11]. The **1980** election continued this trend, with the PAP securing all **75 seats**, solidifying its monopoly over Singaporean politics[12].  

---

## Gradual Introduction of Opposition Representation (1984–1991)  

The **1984** election marked a turning point as opposition candidates won two seats, reducing the PAP’s seat share to **97.47%** (77 out of 79 seats). This was the first time since 1963 that opposition MPs entered Parliament[13]. The PAP’s vote share dipped to 64.8%, reflecting growing voter appetite for political diversity.  

In **1988**, the introduction of Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) bolstered the PAP’s structural advantage. The party won **80 out of 81 seats** (98.77%), though the Workers’ Party (WP) secured a symbolic victory in a single constituency[14]. By **1991**, the opposition gained momentum, winning four seats and reducing the PAP’s seat share to **95.06%** (77 out of 81 seats). This election underscored the PAP’s vulnerability in single-member constituencies[15].  

---

## Consolidation and Fluctuations (1997–2011)  

The **1997** election saw the PAP regain ground, winning **81 out of 83 seats** (97.59%)[16]. The GRC system, now expanded to include four- to six-member wards, diluted opposition gains. However, the WP retained its stronghold in Hougang SMC.  

In **2001**, the PAP won **82 out of 84 seats** (97.62%), aided by a post-9/11 "flight to safety" among voters[17][18]. The opposition’s representation stagnated, with only two seats held by WP and the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).  

The **2006** election mirrored this outcome, with the PAP retaining **82 out of 84 seats** (97.62%) despite a decline in its popular vote to 66.6%[18]. Structural advantages, including walkovers in 55 constituencies, reinforced its dominance.  

The **2011** election marked a watershed moment. The PAP won **81 out of 87 seats** (93.10%), but the opposition captured a record six seats, including the Aljunied GRC—the first GRC lost by the PAP[19]. Voter dissatisfaction over rising housing costs and immigration policies contributed to the PAP’s lowest vote share since independence (60.1%).  

---

## Recent Trends and 2020 Election Outcomes  

The **2020** election solidified the opposition’s growing influence. The PAP won **83 out of 93 seats** (89.25%), its lowest seat share since 1968[5][6][7][8][9]. The Workers’ Party secured 10 seats, including the newly created Sengkang GRC, while the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) made significant inroads in western Singapore. The PAP’s vote share fell to 61.2%, reflecting generational shifts and concerns over governance transparency[6][7].  

---

## Conclusion  

From 1968 to 2020, the PAP maintained an unbroken supermajority, though its seat share gradually declined as opposition parties gained traction. Structural mechanisms like GRCs and high deposits for candidates bolstered the PAP’s dominance, while socioeconomic issues and demographic changes fueled opposition support. Despite these shifts, the PAP’s adaptive strategies—such as leadership renewal and policy responsiveness—have ensured its continued relevance. The 2020 election, held during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted the electorate’s demand for checks and balances, signaling a potential recalibration of Singapore’s political equilibrium.</Perplexity_report>

Current output: Analysis:
The key to forecasting PAP seat share is understanding current voter sentiment and structural factors shaping the upcoming election. We need:
- Pre-election boundary changes and GRC realignments: these determine the total seats and can favor the PAP.
- Candidate line-ups, especially high-profile opposition entrants or retreats.
- Major voter concerns (cost of living, housing, healthcare) and PAP policy responses.
- Performance of opposition in municipal/Town Council by‑elections or grassroots activities.
- Any recent polling or survey data (e.g., from ISEAS, Lianhe Zaobao, Asia Foundation) despite the ban on published polls during the campaign.
- Expert analyses from Straits Times, CNA, Bloomberg, Nikkei Asia, Reuters on PAP popularity trends.
This information will let us adjust the historical base rate (~93% seats in 2020) up or down for an inside‑view forecast.

</Summary>

<Summary source="https://capesingapore.com/electoral-boundaries-an-explainer/2025/">
Here is a concise summary of “Electoral Boundaries: An Explainer” (CAPE, March 11 2025, HJ):

1. The EBRC’s Role  
- The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) is appointed by the Prime Minister (PM), typically senior civil servants.  
- It recommends:  
  • the total number of electoral divisions  
  • the boundaries of each division  
  • how many Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) and Single‑Member Constituencies (SMCs) there should be  
- Though framed as administrative, boundary changes can materially affect election outcomes.

2. EBRC’s Process  
- PM issues terms of reference (e.g., account for population shifts, new housing, adjust average GRC size, set SMC count).  
- Under the Parliamentary Elections Act, the PM must ensure at least eight non‑GRC divisions.  
- The EBRC meets in private to redraw boundaries based on population and development data, then submits its report to the PM.  
- Once the PM presents it in Parliament, the new map applies to the forthcoming election.

3. Why It Matters  
- Representation: Constituency size/composition shapes which communities elect MPs.  
- Electoral dynamics: Redrawn lines can advantage or disadvantage parties (e.g., dissolving a growing‑opposition ward).  
- GRC system: Decisions on GRC numbers and team sizes affect mandated minority representation.  
- Voter engagement: Frequent boundary changes hinder voters’ ties to incumbents and opposition efforts to build local support.

4. Historical Evolution  
- Colonial roots (pre‑1965): SMCs under a British‑style delimitation model (Rendel Commission, 1954, stressed equal representation and geographic factors).  
- Early independence (1966–1987): Retained SMCs; boundaries reviewed every 3–4 years to match rapid urbanisation. A proposed permanent all‑party commission (1958) was never implemented.  
- 1988 onward:  
  • Introduction of GRCs to guarantee minority MPs in each contest.  
  • 1989 Ethnic Integration Policy dispersed ethnic groups via public‑housing quotas, reshaping constituency demographics.  
  • GRC teams grew (up to six members by late 1990s).  
- Modern refinements (1990s–2025): Trend toward smaller GRCs and more SMCs; for GE 2025, there are 15 SMCs (the most since 1997) and no GRC exceeds five members.

5. Comparative Perspective  
- United Kingdom: Four independent Boundary Commissions; reviews every ~8 years; multiple public‑consultation stages; constituencies fixed at 650 with a ±5% electorate quota.  
- New Zealand: Mixed‑Member Proportional system with two ballots (district and party list) and separate Māori electorates sized by Māori enrollment.  
- (Malaysia comparison was noted but not fully detailed in the extract.)

<Summary source="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/pap-manifesto-a-fresh-start-that-strikes-a-familiar-chord">
The Straits Times (April 17, 2025) reports that the PAP unveiled its 2025 election manifesto—titled “Changed World, Fresh Team, New Resolve – Securing a Brighter Future for You”—against a backdrop of rising geopolitical uncertainty and under the leadership of fourth‑generation (4G) Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.

Key facts and promises  
• Manifesto structure: nine chapters addressing bread‑and‑butter concerns (cost of living, public housing) and broader themes (refreshing the social compact; widening definitions of success).  
• Roots in Forward Singapore (Oct 2023): a blueprint drawn up by 4G leaders after consulting over 200,000 citizens. This marks a shift from top‑down policy announcements to seeking citizen input on priorities.  
• PAP renewal efforts:  
  – June 2024 “Refresh PAP” exercise (six months) to widen engagement channels.  
  – Late 2024 election of a new Central Executive Committee.  
  – A slate of 32 first‑time candidates—its largest influx of fresh faces in decades.  

Campaign style and messaging  
• Video appeal: Four‑minute clip features PM Wong against a plain grey background—minimal drone shots or city imagery—with personal appeals:  
   “I am determined to keep this miracle called Singapore going. I will not gamble with your future. … To do this, we need your support.”  
• Stressed themes of stability, continuity and experienced leadership in an “uncertain world.”  

Policy continuities and recent measures  
• Parental leave timeline (government‑paid):  
  – Introduced 2013; doubled to two weeks in 2017; to four weeks in 2023.  
  – In 2024 announced an additional ten weeks of shared leave, bringing total to 30 weeks by April 1, 2026.  
• Many manifesto items have already been announced or are extensions of existing programmes.  

Comparisons and context  
• Manifesto heft: comparatively sparse next to the Workers’ Party’s 122‑page document released the same day.  
• No major surprises—relies on familiar PAP governance style and track record.  
• Voters have two weeks before polling day to decide if this blend of renewal and continuity will resonate.

<Summary source="https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2025/03/27/pm-wong-refuses-to-confirm-election-date-as-wave-of-public-servant-resignations-in-april-hints-at-may-poll/">
Here’s a concise extraction of the key points from The Online Citizen’s 27 March 2025 article:

1. Election timing  
- PM Lawrence Wong, speaking in Hanoi on 26 March, again refused to confirm when the next general election will be called, saying only that “elections will come when they come.”  
- He stressed the need for a “strong and united Singapore” and said, when it’s called, he will “present [his] case for the PAP, for me and my team,” seeking a fresh mandate.

2. Wave of public‑service resignations  
- On 25 March, four senior officials announced they will resign in April:  
  • Shawn Loh (overseeing national budgets)  
  • Jeffrey Siow (Second Perm Sec, Manpower & Trade & Industry)  
  • Tan Ching Yee (Perm Sec for Finance)  
  • Goh Hanyan (Director, Smart Nation Strategy Office)  
- Earlier resignations: Jasmin Lau (Dep Sec (Policy), Health) and Foo Cexiang (Director, Private & Future Mobility, Transport).  
- Such resignations are typically a prelude to these individuals entering politics, fueling speculation of a May election.

3. Electoral Boundaries Review  
- The EBRC report was released on 11 March, redrawing constituency boundaries—often a sign that an election is imminent.  
- State media noted Goh Hanyan at a PAP Meet‑the‑People Session on 17 March in Zhenghua branch (Holland–Bukit Timah GRC).

4. Candidate recruitment process  
- Wong said the PAP has been actively recruiting from public service and other sectors (e.g., academia), “expos[ing] them, test[ing] them.”  
- He acknowledged some prospects may defer to the next election cycle or opt out entirely.  
- He promised “new faces emerging on the ground.”

5. Public reaction (from CNA’s Facebook page)  
- Skepticism about the quality of “leadership renewal,” with some commenters saying each renewal cycle has led to stagnation rather than progress.

**Forum: GE2025 is more than about winning seats**
The upcoming general election (GE2025) in Singapore is not just about winning seats, but a contest of ideas, credibility, and renewal. Both the People's Action Party and Workers' Party are undergoing significant leadership transitions, with the PAP fielding a record number of new candidates and the WP actively grooming its next generation. The election is about whether the political system can evolve with the times, and whether voters choose leaders with both head and heart. Pritam Singh, Leader of the Opposition, has emphasized the need for capable and better individuals to join the party, while Prime Minister Lawrence Wong aims to build a strong and future-ready team. The election is a chance for voters, especially the younger generation, to shape their collective future.

**Singapore polls: Renewal on top of mind of major party leaders**
As Singapore prepares for its 60th year of independence in 2025, the leaders of its two largest political parties, the PAP and Workers' Party, have renewal on their minds. The PAP will field 32 new faces in the upcoming general election, including several high-flying civil servants who quit their jobs to join politics. 'When the new candidates come in, they will inject fresh energy, new ideas and diverse perspectives to strengthen our team,' said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. The WP's leader, Pritam Singh, has also been eyeing its future since he took over in 2018, saying 'You want to bring in people, and not just bring in people... bring in people who are better than me.' The WP's medium-term goal is for opposition MPs to occupy one-third of the seats in Parliament, but it has said it will not field enough candidates in 2025 to carry out its plans. Other opposition parties, such as the Progress Singapore Party and the Singapore Democratic Party, also need to consider renewal and injecting new blood into their parties to have staying power.

**Road to GE: Renewal top of mind as parties head into Singapore election**

**Singapore Elections 2025: PAP's Henry Kwek to Recontest Single-Seat Ward of Kebun Baru**
People's Action Party's (PAP) Henry Kwek has announced that he will recontest the single-seat ward of Kebun Baru in the upcoming Singapore General Election. Kwek outlined three priorities to help the locals: controlling living expenses, promoting healthy aging, and becoming ready for a changing world. He said, 'We've given Kebun Baru a renewed spirit through over a dozen social programs, the efforts of hundreds of volunteers, and thousands of lives touched.' Kwek also mentioned that an assisted living home for the elderly has been established and that he is working with healthcare professionals to support residents in aging healthily. Tony Tan, a PSP candidate, is likely to run against Kwek. Tan has volunteered for the PSP since its founding in 2019 and has a background in engineering and private education.

**WP unveils manifesto highlighting 5 key areas to improve Singapore; PM Wong says PAP will never gamble with future of Singapore: Singapore live news**
The Workers' Party (WP) has unveiled its manifesto for the 2025 General Election, highlighting five key areas to improve Singapore: affordability and cost of living, economic growth and opportunities, inclusion and equality, accountability and democracy, and security and geopolitics. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has stated that the People's Action Party (PAP) will never gamble with the future of Singapore, and that the party will always be upfront and transparent in highlighting the challenges ahead. Meanwhile, the PAP's Rahayu Mahzam has said that coming up with policy ideas is easier than implementing them. The WP's manifesto includes 15 examples of policy proposals, and the party has called for a more inclusive and equitable society. The General Election is set to take place on May 3, 2025.

**Singapore Announces General Elections On May 3, Dissolves Parliament**
Singapore is set to hold general elections on May 3, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's leadership being tested amidst a turbulent global economy. The ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has dominated Singapore for decades, but opposition gains are closely watched as a referendum on the government's popularity. The elections come at a precarious time, with the global trading system under strain since US President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Singapore's trade ministry has downgraded its economic growth forecast for 2025 to between zero and 2.0 percent. Premier Wong declared that the 'era of rules-based globalisation and free trade is over' and warned that Singapore risks being 'squeezed out, marginalised, and left behind.' The opposition is hoping to build on its historic gains in 2020 and is expected to field candidates like Harvard-trained senior counsel Harpreet Singh, who said Singapore could be a 'much better and strong country with a more balanced politics.' 'We need to have a reset where we treat our critics, people with different ideas, people from outside the system, with more respect and not suspicion,' Singh said. The outcome of the elections lies on how much Singaporeans wish to have more alternative views in parliament, but still keep the PAP in power.

**GE2025: Candidates announced in two-thirds of constituencies so far, 5 days before Nomination Day**
The ruling party, the People's Action Party (PAP), has announced its slate for most constituencies ahead of Nomination Day, while opposition parties like the Workers' Party (WP) and the Singapore United Party (SUP) have also put forth candidates. According to Institute of Policy Studies research fellow Teo Kay Key, the PAP may be holding off on finalising candidates in constituencies where they expect to go head-to-head with the WP, such as in the east and north-east. Senior research fellow Gillian Koh noted that the PAP may have decided to reveal its slate early to assure the Malay/Muslim ground in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC. The WP is probably assessing the cost of playing in Tampines, where other opposition parties like the People's Power Party (PPP) and the National Solidarity Party (NSP) have expressed interest. The final line-up in a constituency may not matter as much to voters who look more at a political party's brand or policy proposals, compared to those who have a rapport with their current MP or focus on the candidates they will vote for.

**Singapore polls: Opposition parties ramp up election prep, as some criticise polling date**
The opposition parties in Singapore have expressed concerns over the short timeline between the release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) report and the dissolution of Parliament. The SDP criticized the 'impossibly short' timeline, saying that Singaporeans need time to thoroughly examine issues like the cost of living before casting their votes. Ravi Philemon from the Red Dot United questioned the timing of Nomination Day, saying that it would be better if it were on April 22 instead of April 23. The People's Power Party (PPP) said it was deeply disappointed that the PAP had called an election 'without allowing sufficient time' between the issuance of the Writ of Election and Nomination Day. The opposition parties are now ramping up their election preparations, with some parties already announcing their candidates and campaign plans.

**Singaporeans Remain Undecided Ahead of 2025 General Elections**
A recent survey conducted by YouGov found that only 44% of 1,845 Singaporeans polled in March have made up their minds on which party to vote for in the upcoming 2025 general elections. However, among those who have decided, a majority (63%) plan to vote for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), while 15% intend to vote for the opposition Workers' Party. According to the survey, 'half of all respondents expressed a positive view of the PAP, while 42% felt the same way about the Workers' Party, suggesting that the PAP may face stiff competition', YouGov stated. The survey results come as Singapore has recently redrawn its electoral boundaries, a move typically seen as a sign that the government is preparing for general elections, which must be held before November. Approximately 2.76 million Singaporeans aged 21 and above are registered to vote. The elections will feature 97 seats in parliament, with candidates competing in 15 single-member constituencies and 18 group representation constituencies.

**Where the parties stand on key issues ahead of GE2025 - The Business Times**
The upcoming general election in Singapore has sparked debate among parties on key issues, including fiscal policy. The ruling party, PAP, has proposed raising the goods and services tax (GST) from 7 to 9 per cent to close the gap between revenue and expenditure. The opposition parties, WP and PSP, have opposed the GST hike, citing concerns over inflation and the impact on low-income households. The WP has suggested alternative ways of raising revenue, such as using more past reserves and increasing taxes on wealth. The PSP has proposed using 100 per cent of the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) to fund social spending and improve housing affordability. Analysts say that the debate revolves around intergenerational equity, with the PAP arguing that using more past reserves would leave future generations with fewer resources to cope with crises. The opposition parties argue that the government's approach prioritizes the interests of future generations over those of the present. The debate highlights the challenges of implementing a tiered GST system and wealth taxes, which could improve the progressivity of the tax regime but come with real implementation challenges.

**How Singapore's opposition hopes to loosen the PAP's 66-year grip on power**
In Singapore, the focus of elections is not on whether the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) will lose power, but rather on how much support the opposition can gain. With new electoral boundaries published ahead of a predicted May election, opposition parties face a challenging task as constituencies they had been targeting have been redrawn, and they lack the PAP's powerful party machinery to quickly redirect resources. As one might say, 'it is a more fraught task' for the opposition parties to advance their chances. 'With the new electoral boundaries, all sides are deciding whom to field where,' but the opposition's efforts are hindered by the PAP's 'firm grasp' on power.

**GE2025: For voters in redrawn GRCs, municipal issues are key but some misgivings over perceived gerrymandering**
The recent electoral boundary changes in Singapore have raised concerns about gerrymandering among some voters. While the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) cited uneven population growth as the reason for the changes, opposition parties have questioned the rationale. PAP MPs have described the changes as a reflection of the country's population shifts, but Minister-in-charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing has rejected claims of gerrymandering, stating that the EBRC does not make recommendations based on voting patterns and is comprised of senior civil servants with no party allegiance. As one voter noted, 'It is the candidate that matters, not the constituency.'

**Singapore's opposition claim 'gerrymandering' ahead of election**
Singapore's opposition parties have accused the government of 'gerrymandering' ahead of the upcoming election, citing revisions to the electoral boundaries. The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee proposed changes to all but nine electoral divisions, with the People's Power Party calling it 'massive gerrymandering in plain sight'. The Workers' Party noted 'significant changes' to areas it had been working in, while Progress Singapore Party Secretary-General Hazel Poa said that much of the committee's decision-making remains unexplained. The government has rejected previous calls to review the electoral boundary process, saying it works in the interest of voters, not political parties. The next election is due by November, but could come sooner, and is expected to be a high-stakes vote with even a modest swing in the popular vote potentially leading to a weaker government.

**GE2025: Associate Professor Eugene Tan on electoral boundary changes**
Singapore's electoral map has undergone significant changes for the upcoming General Election, with 18 GRCs and 15 SMCs, two more constituencies than the last election in 2020. According to Associate Professor Eugene Tan from the School of Law at the Singapore Management University, the new electoral boundaries may impact the People's Action Party's (PAP) deployment of its political office holders. Tan also notes that the changes could have implications for opposition parties that have already established a presence on the ground. 'The changes in the electoral boundaries could potentially affect the PAP's deployment of its political office holders,' Tan said. 'It could also affect the opposition parties which may have already walked the ground and established a presence in these new constituencies.'

The People's Action Party (PAP) has stated that its branches and activists will make necessary adjustments to prepare for the upcoming General Election. Several PAP MPs have reaffirmed their commitment to serving their residents, despite changes to their constituencies. In contrast, opposition parties have criticized the redrawn electoral boundaries, with The Progress Singapore Party's Secretary-General Hazel Poa claiming that the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) could have accounted for population shifts without making drastic changes. According to Poa, 'it could have accounted for population shifts without making drastic changes to the electoral boundaries.'

   - Election scheduled for May 3, 2025 (12 days away)
   - 97 directly elected seats across 33 constituencies
   - PAP pre-election composition: 83/93 seats (89.2%)

2. **CAPE Singapore article on Electoral Boundaries** (March 11, 2025):
   - Reputable non-partisan organization providing factual analysis
   - For GE2025: 15 SMCs (most since 1997) and no GRCs exceed five members
   - Detailed explanation of boundary-drawing process and implications

3. **Straits Times articles on PAP manifesto** (April 17, 2025):
   - Singapore's paper of record; high quality recent information
   - PAP manifesto emphasizes stability, continuity and experienced leadership
   - Detailed policies across economy, education, cost of living, healthcare, housing

4. **The Online Citizen article** (March 27, 2025):
   - Opposition-leaning source; includes some opinion alongside reporting
   - Notes public servant resignations suggesting new PAP candidates
   - Includes critical public reactions to PAP leadership renewal

5. **YouGov poll** (April 9, 2025 via Asknews):
   - High-quality polling data from respected international firm
   - Only 44% of 1,845 Singaporeans decided which party to vote for
   - Among decided voters: 63% for PAP, 15% for Workers' Party
   - 56% remain undecided, indicating significant uncertainty

6. **Multiple news sources on opposition preparations** (April 15-20, 2025):
   - Consistent reporting across sources indicating:
   - PAP fielding 32 new candidates (largest renewal in decades)
   - Workers' Party released 122-page manifesto
   - Opposition parties concerned about short preparation timeline
   - Multiple boundary complaints from opposition indicating perceived disadvantage

## Evidence Analysis:

### Strong Evidence
- **Historical trend of PAP seat share**: Clear gradual decline over multiple election cycles (97.6% in 2006 → 93.3% in 2015 → 89.2% in 2020)
- **Electoral system structural factors**: GRC system generally advantages PAP; boundary changes typically favor incumbent
- **YouGov polling data**: 63% of decided voters back PAP, though majority remain undecided

### Moderate Evidence
- **Opposition momentum**: Workers' Party won record 10 seats in 2020; running substantial campaign
- **Boundary changes impact**: Expansion to 97 seats; more SMCs potentially benefiting opposition
- **Leadership transition effect**: First election under Lawrence Wong; 32 new PAP candidates

### Weak Evidence
- **Cost of living and affordability concerns**: Featured in manifestos but unclear which party benefits
- **Public reactions in online comments**: Anecdotal evidence of dissatisfaction
- **Short campaign period**: Opposition complaints about preparation time

## Timeframe Analysis:

The election is scheduled for May 3, 2025, just 12 days from today. With such an imminent election:
- Campaigns are already well underway
- Boundaries and candidates are mostly finalized
- Limited time for major shifts in public opinion

If the timeframe were longer (e.g., if election were several months away), there would be greater uncertainty, particularly regarding how voters would respond to PM Wong's leadership and how opposition parties might build campaign momentum.

## Justification:

My forecast integrates these key factors:

1. **Historical trajectory**: PAP seat share has declined gradually but consistently, from 97.6% (2006) to 89.2% (2020). This trend reflects Singapore's maturing democracy and suggests continued marginal losses for PAP.

2. **Structural advantages persist**: Despite the declining trend, Singapore's electoral system still significantly favors PAP through the GRC system and boundary-drawing process. Opposition complaints about "gerrymandering" in 2025 suggest these advantages remain.

3. **Leadership transition introduces uncertainty**: This is PM Lawrence Wong's first election as leader, with PAP fielding 32 new candidates (⅓ of their slate). This significant renewal could resonate with voters seeking fresh faces or create concerns about inexperience.

4. **Opposition strength has plateaued**: While Workers' Party holds a record 10 seats, their stated goal of winning ⅓ of parliament remains a medium-term aspiration. News reports indicate they won't contest enough seats in 2025 to achieve this.

5. **Polling data suggests modest PAP advantage**: The YouGov poll shows 63% of decided voters backing PAP (vs 15% for WP), but with 56% undecided, there's significant uncertainty.

These factors collectively suggest PAP's seat share will likely continue its gradual decline from the 2020 baseline of 89.2%, but the structural advantages and polling data suggest this decline will be modest. PAP will maintain its parliamentary supermajority.

## Probability Calibration:

Looking at the 97 seats being contested:
- Each percentage point represents roughly 1 seat
- Historical trend suggests 2-4% decline per election
- Structural advantages create a high floor for PAP performance

Lower bound scenarios (10th percentile and below):
- Opposition builds significantly on 2020 momentum
- Undecided voters break heavily against PAP
- Workers' Party defends current seats and adds 2-3 more
- Other opposition parties make breakthrough wins

Upper bound scenarios (90th percentile and above):
- PAP's renewal strategy resonates strongly with voters
- Leadership transition viewed as successful refresh
- Economic uncertainty drives voters to incumbent
- Opposition momentum stalls completely

Central tendency (40th-60th percentile):
- PAP continues gradual seat share decline
- Opposition maintains most or all current seats
- 1-2 additional seats might flip to opposition
- Overall modest continuation of historical trend

## Checklist:
1. Target: Percentage of seats won by PAP in Singapore's May 3, 2025 general election.
2. Base rate: PAP won 89.2% in 2020, with gradual downward trend from previous elections.
3. Consistency: Implied median ~87%; mean ~85-86%; aligns with expected slight continuation of downward trend.
4. Key evidence: Historical PAP seat decline; YouGov poll favoring PAP but many undecided; electoral structural advantages; leadership transition with 32 new candidates; limited opposition reach.
5. Blind spot: Major surge in opposition support due to cost-of-living concerns or leadership dissatisfaction could lead to multiple unexpected GRC losses for PAP.

   - Factual overview: May 3 polling day, 97 seats across 33 constituencies
   - First election under PM Lawrence Wong (since May 2024)
   - Pre-election composition: PAP (83 elected MPs), WP (10 elected MPs)
   - High factual reliability, minimal opinion content

2. **CAPE on Electoral Boundaries (March 2025)**
   - Factual explanation of EBRC role and boundary-setting process
   - Notes GE2025 will have 15 SMCs (most since 1997)
   - Reliable educational source with limited opinion content

3. **Straits Times on PAP Manifesto (April 2025)**
   - Details PAP's messaging emphasizing stability and continuity
   - Notes PAP fielding 32 first-time candidates (largest influx in decades)
   - Reliable reporting of PAP's positioning and campaign themes

4. **The Online Citizen (March 2025)**
   - Reports on public service resignations preceding election announcements
   - Notes public skepticism about leadership renewal
   - Alternative perspective with some critical framing

5. **March 2025 YouGov Poll (via Беларусь Сегодня, April 9)**
   - 44% of Singaporeans undecided on voting
   - Among decided voters: 63% support PAP, 15% support WP
   - 50% positive view of PAP, 42% positive view of WP
   - Potentially significant data point from established polling organization

6. **Multiple reports on opposition claims of gerrymandering (March 2025)**
   - Opposition parties critical of boundary changes
   - Government rejects gerrymandering claims
   - Balanced reporting of competing perspectives

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Historical PAP performance data (89.25% of seats in 2020 election)
- Structural increase from 93 to 97 total elected seats
- YouGov polling data showing 63% PAP support among decided voters
- Multiple sources confirming PAP fielding 32 new candidates

**Moderate Evidence:**
- First election under PM Lawrence Wong's leadership
- WP not fielding enough candidates to achieve one-third parliament goal
- Boundary changes potentially affecting opposition strongholds
- Economic context (4.4% growth in 2024, but downgraded 2025 forecast)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Campaign messaging themes
- Opposition complaints about election timeline
- Individual constituency dynamics

## Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is extremely short - just 12 days until the May 3, 2025 election. This has several implications:

- High certainty about electoral timing (unlike many election forecasts)
- Limited time for major shifts in public opinion or party positioning
- Most candidates already announced and manifestos released
- Remaining uncertainties include final candidate lineup in remaining constituencies, potential last-minute developments, and voter turnout factors

If the timeframe were halved, my prediction would remain similar since most determining factors are already set. If doubled, there would be more opportunity for campaign developments, but structural factors would remain dominant.

## Justification

1. **Historical Baseline and Trend**
   The 2020 result (83/93 seats = 89.25%) provides our primary reference point. The PAP has experienced gradual erosion in seat share over decades, suggesting a continuation of incremental opposition gains is likely. With 97 seats in the new Parliament, the mathematical equivalent of the 2020 result would be approximately 87 seats (89.69%).

2. **Leadership Transition Impact**
   This is PM Wong's first election as PAP leader. While PAP has historically managed leadership transitions well, new leaders typically face some electoral challenges as voters adjust. This adds moderate uncertainty to the forecast.

3. **PAP Renewal Strategy**
   The unprecedented 32 new candidates (one-third of their slate) represents a significant renewal effort that could address voter concerns about new blood. However, new candidates lack the established voter connections of incumbents, creating a mixed effect.

4. **Opposition Capacity and Limitations**
   The Workers' Party isn't fielding enough candidates to achieve its one-third representation goal. Opposition resources are stretched by boundary changes, constraining potential gains despite polling strength.

5. **Polling Evidence**
   The YouGov poll showing 63% PAP support among decided voters is notably below their 2020 vote share (61.2% of total votes). The significant undecided bloc (44%) and narrowing opinion gap between PAP (50%) and WP (42%) suggest potential for change from historical patterns.

6. **Electoral System Changes**
   Boundary revisions typically advantage the incumbent party that controls the process. The increased seat count (from 93 to 97) changes the percentage mathematics, with each seat now representing approximately 1.03% of Parliament.

Integrating these factors, I expect PAP's seat share to decline modestly from the 2020 equivalent, with a moderate range of uncertainty due to competing factors.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the 2020 result (83/93 seats = 89.25%) as a baseline:
- Mathematical equivalent for 97-seat Parliament: 86.6 seats ≈ 87/97 = 89.69%

Key adjustments to consider:
1. Historical trend suggests continued gradual decline (-1 to -3 percentage points)
2. First-time PAP leader adds uncertainty (widening distribution)
3. YouGov polling suggests potential for larger opposition gains (tilting distribution leftward)
4. PAP renewal strategy and boundary changes may partially offset decline
5. Opposition limitations constrain potential gains (floor effect)

For the central range (40-60th percentiles):
- Expected modest decline from 2020 equivalent: 87-88% of seats (84-85/97 seats)

For wider distribution:
- Lower percentiles: Scenarios of stronger opposition performance (81-83/97 seats)
- Higher percentiles: Scenarios of PAP resilience or improved performance (86-90/97 seats)
- Extreme percentiles: Capture low-probability outcomes in either direction

# Checklist:
1. Target: Percentage of seats won by PAP in Singapore's May 3, 2025 election out of 97 elected seats
2. Base rate: 2020 result of 89.25% (equivalent to 89.69% in 97-seat Parliament)
3. Consistency: Median ≈87.5%, reflecting expected slight decline from 2020
4. Key evidence: Historical trend, YouGov polling (63% PAP support), 32 new PAP candidates, first election under Wong, increased seat count
5. Blind spot: Unexpected late-campaign development shifting voter sentiment substantially

=== Forecaster 3 ===
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Wikipedia (GE 2025 basics): high reliability for structural facts (97 seats, polling 3 May 2025, leadership change to PM Wong).  
- Straits Times (Apr 17–20 2025): authoritative local press; confirms PAP manifesto continuity/renewal, team renewal of 32 new candidates, boundary changes to 15 SMCs & 18 GRCs. Factual event reporting; opinion pieces flagged as such.  
- Business Times (Apr 12 2025): reliable for PAP’s candidate slate, commentaries on “fierce contest”; opinion from PM Wong.  
- Asknews articles (Apr 15–20 2025): mixed sources; factual on opposition strategy, public servant resignations, boundary‐review critique. Treat expert statements (Eugene Tan, WP leadership) as moderate evidence; anecdotal social‐media reaction as weak.  
- YouGov poll (Mar 2025): methodologically transparent; 44% decided voters, 63% of them support PAP → implies ~28% of electorate firmly PAP. Moderate evidence for electorate lean.  
- SCMP (Mar 2025): commentary on opposition challenges post‐boundary‐changes; use for institutional context.  

2. Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong evidence  
- Historical PAP seat share trend: 2011 93.1%, 2015 93.3%, 2020 89.2% (five‐election downward drift).  
- Structural factor: PAP renewal + boundary redrawing yields modest incumbent advantage.  
Moderate evidence  
- YouGov poll: decided‐voter lean to PAP, but high undecided → moderate cushion.  
- Opposition slate limits maximum seats opposition can win (cap on PAP lower tail).  
Weak evidence  
- Social‐media skepticism, PSP’s local challenges, MNC vote swings.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
- 12 days until polling (3 May 2025). With half the time (6 days), less late‐breaking intel would raise uncertainty (widen distribution). With double time (24 days), incremental campaign events (rallies, gaffes) could shift voter preferences moderately, but structural seat‐share movements in Singapore are historically small.  

4. Justification of inside‐view adjustment  
- Outside view base: mean of last three elections = (93.1+93.3+89.2)/3 ≈ 91.9%.  
- Status quo drift: 2020 saw –4.1 pp from 2015; renewal push in 2025 likely arrests further declines.  
- Boundary changes (4 more seats, more SMCs) favor incumbents: +1–2 pp upward adjustment.  
- Opposition consolidation (WP strongholds, PSP incremental ground) cap PAP downside at ≈ 80%.  
- Polling stability: decisive‐voter support for PAP suggests a cushion but high undecided means potential volatility but unlikely to swing > 5 pp.  
- Combine: adjust outside‐view mean ≈ 92% into inside‐view median ≈ 92%.  

Probability calibration  
We produce a full distribution reflecting possible seat shares from a low‐end opposition surge to a high‐end PAP sweep.

Checklist:  
1. Target: PAP seat share (%) of 97 elected seats on 3 May 2025.  
2. Outside view base: mean ≈ 91.9% from 2011–2020.  
3. Consistency: Implied median ≈ 91.5%; aligns with justification around 92%.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a. Historical seat‐share trend (– drift).  
   b. Boundary changes favoring PAP.  
   c. Opposition candidate slate cap.  
   d. YouGov decided‐voter lean.  
5. Blind spot: late scandal within PAP or unexpected opposition landslide could push share > 95% or < 85%.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Wikipedia “2025 Singaporean general election” (updated 21 Apr 2025): High‑quality factual summary of election basics (date, seats, leadership, timetable). Reliable for structural details; no opinion.  
- Straits Times (17–20 Apr 2025) articles on PAP manifesto, renewal, candidate slates, voter reaction: Leading Singapore daily; factual reporting with quoted experts. Opinions clearly attributed.  
- Business Times (12 Apr 2025): Credible business daily; reports PAP’s new‑candidate strategy, seat tally, PM Wong quotes. Factual with expert commentary.  
- Asknews articles (Varied dates Mar–Apr 2025): Mixed reliability. Weigh only identifiable expert commentary (e.g., YouGov poll; Eugene Tan on boundaries). Discard anecdotal or unverified claims.  
- YouGov poll (Mar 2025 via “Singaporeans Remain Undecided”): Methodological transparency, 1845 respondents. Useful for gauging voter intent but high undecided rate (56%).  

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
- Historical seat shares (2011 80.6%, 2015 94.9%, 2020 89.3%): clear baseline trend of PAP seat share.  
- Electoral boundary changes (EBRC, Mar 2025) – increases SMCs to 15; structural factor strongly favors PAP in new SMCs.  
- PAP renewal drive (32 new candidates; 4G leadership): institutional continuity and incumbency advantage.  

Moderate evidence  
- YouGov poll: decided voters favor PAP 63% vs WP 15%. Indirect link to seat share.  
- Opposition manifestos and candidate slates: shows momentum but limited scale outside WP strongholds.  

Weak evidence  
- Social‑media skepticism and gerrymandering claims: anecdotal, unlikely to materially shift outcome.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Forecast horizon: ~12 days until polling day (3 May 2025).  
- Halve horizon (6 days): near‑certainty on candidate lineups; only late swings in sentiment could shift outcome–tails widen slightly.  
- Double horizon (24 days back to now): more time for campaign events, debates, potential shocks (e.g., scandal), greater uncertainty–tails widen more.  

4. Justification & inside‑view adjustments  
Outside‑view base rate: mean ≈91.2% PAP seat share (2011–2020 reference class), with modest downward trend but high volatility.  
Adjustments:  
- Boundary changes (+) – more SMCs, default PAP wins in areas without strong opposition.  
- New leader uncertainty (–) – 4G untested at polls, slight risk of voter churn or “renewal” backfiring.  
- Opposition strength (+/–) – WP likely to defend incumbencies but field too few candidates elsewhere to gain seats at scale. PSP and others under‑resourced.  
- Polling momentum (+) – decided voters lean to PAP, but high undecided keeps some downside risk.  

Net effect: minor upward shift in both center and right tail from base rate; slight increase in uncertainty in left tail. Median moves to ≈91% from 91.2%; distribution skewed modestly right.

Probability calibration  

Checklist:  
1. Target variable: PAP’s percentage of directly elected seats in GE2025, resolved by credible media on or shortly after 3 May 2025.  
2. Outside‑view base rate: mean ≈91.2% (2011–2020).  
3. Consistency check: Implied median ≈91%; mean ≈91.5%; aligned with upward‑tilted adjustments.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Historical seat‑share trend (strong)  
   • EBRC boundary changes favoring PAP (strong)  
   • New‑leader test & renewal risk (moderate)  
   • YouGov poll leaning PAP (moderate)  
5. Blind‑spot: A late scandal or sensational opposition breakthrough could depress PAP below 80% (low‑probability downside shock).

Analysis
1. Source analysis (chronological, factual → opinion split, quality 1‑5)  
a. Wikipedia “2025 Singaporean general election” (19 Apr 25; Q = 5). Factual election timetable, 97 seats, leadership hand‑over – high reliability.  
b. EBRC explainer (CAPE, 11 Mar 25; Q = 4). Factual description of new boundaries, contextual history; opinion limited to “can affect outcomes”.  
c. Straits Times 17 Apr 25 PAP manifesto (Q = 4). Mostly factual content of manifesto; mild editorial colour.  
d. Straits Times 20 Apr 25 “Forum” op‑ed (Q = 3). Pure opinion, no new facts → ignored for numeric shift.  
e. YouGov poll (Belarus’ Today relay, 9 Apr 25; Q = 3‑). Single opt‑in online panel; useful directional signal but methodological limits.  
f. NDTV 15 Apr 25 dissolution report (Q = 4). Factual dissolution date, growth downgrade; quotes analysts.  
g. CNA / SCMP pieces on boundary changes & gerrymandering (13‑15 Mar 25; Q = 4). Factual map changes, balanced expert comment.  
h. Historical Elections Department seat data 1988‑2020 (compiled 21 Apr 25; Q = 5). Core reference class.  

2. Evidence analysis (relative strength)  
Strong (structural):  
• GRC bloc voting continues – converts PAP popular‑vote majorities into very large seat shares.  
• Historical seat shares 2011‑2020 (93 %, 93 %, 89 %) – trend but still dominant.  
Moderate:  
• Additional 2 SMCs (+1 p.p. of total seats) marginally easier for opposition.  
• Leadership transition – 1990 & 2004 precedents show ≤2 p.p. seat effect.  
• Cost‑of‑living discontent & slowed 2025 growth (0‑2 %) – erodes PAP vote but not necessarily seats.  
• YouGov March poll: 63 % of decided → PAP; 56 % still undecided. Implies vote share ~60 % if undecided split evenly – close to 2020.  
Weak:  
• Social‑media chatter, anecdotal resignation‑to‑candidate pipeline, short campaign window criticisms.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
Polls close in 12 days (Nomination in 2). At this stage swings >3 p.p. in seat share typically require a late‑breaking scandal or opposition co‑ordination breakthrough—low probability.  
If timeframe halved (6 days): variance would fall ~15 % (less time for shocks).  
If doubled (24 days): variance rises ~10 % (more time for macro or campaign shocks).

4. Outside‑view baseline  
Mean 2011‑2020 PAP seat share = 91.9 %, SD ≈ 2.5 p.p.  Start at 92 %.

5. Inside‑view adjustments  
–1.0 p.p. continuation of youthful‑electorate drift.  
–0.5 p.p. two extra SMCs.  
–1.0 p.p. headline inflation / growth worries.  
+0.5 p.p. multi‑corner fights splintering opposition vote.  
Net = –2.0 p.p. → 90 %.  Add one more –2 p.p. to reflect 2020 step‑down that may persist (no reversion yet observed).  
Point estimate ≈ 88 %.  Retain SD 3 p.p.; fatten left tail because an opposition “wave” is imaginable though unprecedented.  

Probability calibration
Implied mean 88.3 %, median 88.7 % (≈86 seats).  90 % CI 82 %–92 % (78–90 seats).  Discrete mapping uses 1.03 p.p. per seat.

Checklist  
1. Target: PAP seat % of 97 elected MPs on polling day 3 May 2025.  
2. Base rate 91.9 %.  
3. Implied median = 88.7 %, mean = 88.3 % – consistent with downward drift + GRC cushion.  
4. Key factors: (i) GRC amplifies majority (strong ↑), (ii) 2020 drop shows ceiling broken (moderate ↓), (iii) more SMCs (moderate ↓), (iv) cost‑of‑living angst (moderate ↓), (v) opposition fragmentation (moderate ↑).  
5. Blind‑spot: Corruption scandal or sudden WP‑PSP alliance before Nomination; would push seat share down sharply (<80 %).
