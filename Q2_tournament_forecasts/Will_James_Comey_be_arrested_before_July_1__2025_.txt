Analysis:
This question hinges on how unprecedented it would be for a former FBI director—one of the highest-profile law enforcement officials in the U.S.—to be arrested. To form an out-view baseline, I need data on arrests of comparable figures (former FBI directors, senior DOJ officials, cabinet-level law enforcement heads) and the historical frequency and context in which such arrests occur. Key factors: have any ex-FBI directors ever faced arrest or indictment? How often do high-ranking federal officials get arrested, and what is the typical timeline from initial inquiry to arrest? Also, any ongoing investigations or public-record probes into Comey’s actions (e.g., the Secret Service inquiry about the seashell photo) could shift probabilities upward if they represent nascent law-enforcement interest. My Google queries will surface lists and news of past arrests of comparable figures; my Perplexity query will request a synthesized historical overview to calibrate the base rate.

Analysis:
The key to assessing whether James Comey might be arrested before July 1, 2025 is tracking any emerging law-enforcement or prosecutorial actions against him. To develop an inside-view forecast, I need recent reporting on investigations—whether the Justice Department, Secret Service, or other agencies have issued subpoenas, convened a grand jury, sought arrest warrants, or advanced formal charges. The May 16 NYT piece on the Secret Service querying Comey about a seashells photo (“86 47”) suggests heightened scrutiny, but no charges have been filed. I’ll look for:
- Any new DOJ or inspector-general probe into Comey’s conduct
- Subpoenas or court filings that mention Comey
- Public statements by prosecutors or law-enforcement officials about charging decisions
- Political or departmental signals (e.g., statements by Attorney General Merrick Garland)
These pieces will inform whether the probability of an arrest is rising from the baseline “no action” scenario.

2. James Comey arrest legal probe news (Google News)
3. Summarize recent legal investigations or law enforcement actions that might lead to James Comey’s arrest, including developments since the seashells photo inquiry. I’m particularly interested in any credible reports of subpoenas, warrants, or charges being prepared. (Assistant)

<Summary source="https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/robert-hanssen">
Here is a concise summary of the FBI’s official account of Robert Philip Hanssen:

1. Background  
• January 12, 1976: Hanssen becomes an FBI special agent, swears to uphold the Constitution.  
• Over the next decade, he advances into key counterintelligence roles with full access to classified systems.

2. Espionage Activity  
• Began spying for the Soviet Union/Russia in 1985 under the alias “Ramon Garcia.”  
• Provided highly classified national-security information—compromising human sources, techniques, documents and operations—in exchange for over $1.4 million (cash, bank transfers, diamonds).  
• Used encrypted communications, “dead drops” and other clandestine methods.  
• His betrayals continued, largely undetected, even after fellow mole Aldrich Ames’s 1994 arrest.

3. Investigation and Surveillance  
• Late 1990s: After Ames, FBI/CIA sift ongoing leaks; incorrectly focus on a CIA officer until Russian records in 2000 point to Hanssen.  
• Deputy Dir. Debra Evans Smith: “What we wanted to do was get enough evidence to convict him, and…the ultimate aim was to catch him in the act.”  
• Hanssen is lured back from a State Department detailee post to FBI HQ in January 2001 by Assistant Dir. Neil Gallagher with a fake technology-project assignment and a promised promotion.  
• He is placed in a small, covertly bugged office; assistant Eric O’Neill reports on his movements; ~300 personnel monitor him around the clock.

4. Arrest (February 18, 2001)  
• Surveillance tracks Hanssen to Foxstone Park, Fairfax County, VA, as he makes a dead-drop exchange.  
• FBI arrest team moves in as he returns to his car; he is taken into custody “red-handed.”

5. Prosecution and Sentence  
• July 6, 2001: Hanssen pleads guilty to 15 counts of espionage.  
• May 10, 2002: Sentenced to life in prison without parole.  
• June 5, 2023: Hanssen dies in custody at age 79.

6. Statement of FBI Director Louis J. Freeh (Feb 20, 2001)  
• Announces Hanssen’s arrest for espionage dating back to 1985; alleges he received over $600,000 (later reports cite $1.4 million total).  
• Notes the FBI/CIA/State/DOJ partnership, the grave damage to U.S. security and praises the investigative team’s counterintelligence work.

Facts and Events  
• On Thursday, May 15, James B. Comey posted on Instagram a photo of seashells arranged on a beach to spell “86 47.”  
• Merriam-Webster defines “eighty-six” as old slang meaning “to dismiss or remove.”  
• Senior administration officials (including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem) viewed the post as an implied call for President Trump’s assassination.  
• On Friday, May 16, the Secret Service—under Noem’s department—interviewed Comey at a Washington field office.  
  – Comey voluntarily consented and was driven there by agents.  
  – He deleted the Instagram post before the interview, stating, “I didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence … I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.”  
  – He returned home Friday night after questioning.  
• It is uncommon for senior officials like Noem or Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to comment publicly on Secret Service investigations.

Named Opinions (Reliable Sources)  
• Kristi Noem (Homeland Security Secretary): Announced the Secret Service was investigating the post.  
• Tulsi Gabbard (Director of National Intelligence): On Fox News said Comey “should be jailed.”  
• President Trump (in a Fox News interview with Bret Baier):

  – Two officials say Comey was interviewed Friday at the Secret Service’s Washington, D.C., field office; the session lasted about 90 minutes.  
  – A Secret Service spokesperson: “We vigorously investigate anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees…Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.”  

• Comey’s response  
  – In a follow-up Instagram post, Comey said he thought the shells were “a political message,” hadn’t realized any violent connotation, “oppose[s] violence of any kind,” and thus deleted the image.  
  – CBS News has reached out to Comey’s attorneys for further comment.

Query: What arrests have occurred of former high-ranking US law enforcement officials, including any ex-FBI directors? Provide examples, timelines from investigation to arrest, frequency, and context.
# Arrests of Former High-Ranking US Law Enforcement Officials: Contextual Analysis and Case Studies  

The arrest and prosecution of high-ranking law enforcement officials in the United States represent significant events that test the integrity of institutions tasked with upholding justice. While such cases remain relatively rare due to the stringent vetting processes for leadership roles, several prominent examples illustrate systemic vulnerabilities, ethical lapses, and the consequences of abusing public trust. This report examines key cases involving former FBI officials, police commissioners, and sheriffs, analyzing timelines from investigation to arrest, legal outcomes, and broader implications for law enforcement accountability.  

## Former FBI Leadership: L. Patrick Gray and Ethical Investigations  

### L. Patrick Gray III: Legal Challenges During the Watergate Era  
L. Patrick Gray, who served as Acting FBI Director from May 1972 to April 1973, faced federal charges in 1978 related to unauthorized break-ins targeting members of the Weather Underground, a radical group linked to domestic terrorism[19]. These "black bag jobs" involved warrantless searches of homes belonging to associates of fugitives, a tactic the FBI had historically employed but which violated Fourth Amendment protections. Gray was indicted alongside two subordinates, W. Mark Felt and Edward S. Miller, on conspiracy charges for authorizing the operations during his tenure[19].  

The investigation, led by the Justice Department under Attorney General Griffin Bell, alleged that Gray had approved the illegal activities during meetings with field agents in 1972. However, the case against Gray unraveled due to insufficient evidence; 24 conference attendees could not recall Gray authorizing break-ins, and contemporaneous notes failed to document such orders[19]. In December 1980, Chief U.S. District Judge William Bryant dismissed the charges against Gray, citing unconvincing evidence, while Felt and Miller were convicted and fined[19]. Gray later filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against the Justice Department, alleging negligent investigation and reputational harm, though the outcome of this suit remains unclear[19].  

This case highlights the legal and political turbulence of the post-Watergate era, where scrutiny of FBI practices led to reforms but also entangled officials in protracted legal battles. Gray’s ordeal underscores the challenges of holding leadership accountable for operational decisions made during crises.  

## Police Commissioners: Bernard Kerik and Systemic Corruption  

### Bernard Kerik: From 9/11 Hero to Federal Prison  
Bernard Kerik, New York City Police Commissioner from 2000 to 2001, gained national prominence for his role in the 9/11 response but faced a dramatic fall from grace. A federal investigation initiated in 2004 uncovered a pattern of corruption, including tax fraud, false statements, and accepting illicit gifts[2][7]. Key allegations included using a subsidized apartment intended for first responders for extramarital affairs and failing to report $255,000 in income[7].  

The timeline of Kerik’s legal troubles began in 2006 with guilty pleas to misdemeanor ethics violations in New York State court, resulting in $221,000 in fines[7]. Federal charges followed in 2007, culminating in a 2009 guilty plea to eight felonies, including tax fraud and lying to White House officials during his 2004 Homeland Security nomination vetting[2]. On February 18, 2010, Kerik was sentenced to 48 months in federal prison, of which he served three years before release[2]. His 2020 pardon by President Donald Trump did not expunge the conviction but exempted him from further penalties[7].  

Kerik’s case exemplifies how personal misconduct and financial crimes can undermine public trust, even among officials celebrated for leadership during national tragedies. The multi-year investigation also revealed weaknesses in political appointment vetting processes.  

## County Sheriffs: Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Justice  

### Michael S. Carona: "America’s Sheriff" and the Cost of Hubris  
Michael Carona, Orange County Sheriff from 1999 to 2008, was indicted in 2007 on charges of witness tampering, mail fraud, and conspiracy following a federal probe into campaign finance irregularities[9][10]. Investigators found that Carona had accepted over $350,000 in bribes, including cash, luxury gifts, and a boat, in exchange for political favors such as granting reserve deputy badges to donors[11].  

The investigation gained traction after testimony from former Assistant Sheriff Don Haidl, who wore a wire during conversations implicating Carona in obstruction[12]. Although acquitted of five charges in 2009, Carona was convicted of witness tampering for urging Haidl to lie to a grand jury[12]. On April 27, 2009, he received a 66-month prison sentence, with Judge Andrew Guilford rebuking his conduct as a betrayal of public trust[12]. Carona’s case underscores how personal greed and loyalty tests among subordinates can catalyze institutional corruption.  

### Lee Baca: Concealing Jailhouse Abuses  
Lee Baca, Los Angeles County Sheriff from 1998 to 2014, was convicted in 2017 of obstructing an FBI investigation into deputy brutality within county jails[13][14]. The probe began in 2011 after deputies discovered an inmate informant cooperating with federal agents and, under Baca’s alleged orders, hid the informant and threatened an FBI agent with arrest[14].  

Despite initially accepting a plea deal in 2016, Judge Percy Anderson rejected the agreement as too lenient, leading to a trial where Baca was found guilty of conspiracy, obstruction, and lying[14]. Sentenced to three years in prison, Baca began his term in 2020 after exhausting appeals[13]. His case illustrates the perils of institutional insularity and the lengths to which leaders may go to shield their agencies from external oversight.  

### Joe Arpaio: Racial Profiling and Contempt of Court  
Joe Arpaio, Maricopa County Sheriff from 1993 to 2016, was convicted of criminal contempt in 2017 for defying a court order to cease immigration patrols targeting Latino communities[15][16]. The charges stemmed from a 2007 racial profiling lawsuit, *Melendres v. Arpaio*, which found his policies unconstitutional[16]. Despite the conviction, Arpaio avoided jail time via a presidential pardon from Donald Trump in August 2017[16].  

Arpaio’s case remains controversial, highlighting tensions between federal judiciary authority and executive clemency. Critics argue the pardon eroded accountability for civil rights violations, while supporters framed it as a rebuke of judicial overreach[15].  

## Analysis of Frequency and Institutional Reforms  
Arrests of top-tier law enforcement officials occur sporadically, often following prolonged investigations triggered by whistleblowers or federal oversight. Between 1978 and 2020, the cases above suggest a pattern where corruption (e.g., Kerik, Carona) or obstruction of justice (e.g., Baca, Arpaio) predominate. FBI leadership arrests remain exceedingly rare, with Gray’s indictment standing as an outlier tied to unique historical circumstances.  

Post-9/11 expansions of law enforcement powers have intensified scrutiny of ethical practices, leading to reforms such as enhanced financial disclosure requirements and independent oversight boards. However, the persistence of cases like Baca’s indicates systemic challenges in balancing authority with accountability.  

## Conclusion  
The arrest of high-ranking law enforcement officials, though infrequent, reveals critical vulnerabilities in governance structures. From Gray’s Watergate-era charges to Baca’s jailhouse cover-up, these cases underscore the necessity of robust checks on power, transparent investigative processes, and cultural shifts toward institutional humility. While reforms have mitigated some risks, the evolving nature of corruption and obstruction demands continual vigilance to preserve public trust in law enforcement.</Perplexity_report>

Here are the key points from Rep. Andy Ogles’s May 15, 2025 letter urging an investigation into James Comey:

1. Addressee and Purpose  
   • Sent to Secret Service Director Sean Curran, FBI Director Kash Patel, and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino.  
   • Requests formal criminal investigations by both agencies into Comey.

2. Triggering Incident  
   • On May 15, Comey posted an Instagram photo showing seashells arranged as “86 47.”  
   • “86 47” is “widely understood” (per Ogles) as code for “kill 47” (i.e., assassinate President Trump).

3. Alleged Legal Violations  
   • 18 U.S.C. § 871 – Threats against the President.  
   • 18 U.S.C. § 875 – Interstate communications containing threats.  

4. Additional Requests  
   • Confirmation of whether Comey still holds any security clearances or access to classified materials.

5. Quotes from Rep. Ogles (Republican, Tennessee)  
   • “This isn’t just bad judgment—it’s a veiled threat from a former FBI Director who knows exactly what he’s doing.”  
   • “If a right-winger posted this against a leftist, all hell would break loose. But because it’s James Comey…the left is silent. That’s unacceptable.”  
   • “If James Comey thinks he’s above the law…he should be in handcuffs.”

All opinions above (including interpretation of “86 47” and calls for “perp walks”) are those of Rep. Ogles. There is no indication in the article that the Secret Service or FBI have opened any investigation as of its publication.

- Secret Service Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi (to NBC News): “We are aware … and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.”  
- White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich (on X): Called the post “deeply concerning” and said it “can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit’ on the sitting President.”

3. Comey’s response  
- Comey posted a statement on Instagram saying he simply shared shells he saw and opposed violence of any kind; he “took the post down” once he learned some associate those numbers with violence.

4. Calls for further action  
- Some unnamed Republican figures have demanded Comey’s arrest and even a raid on his home (origins of these calls not specified in the article).  
- Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. (on X): “Just James Comey casually calling for my dad to be murdered. This is who the Dem-Media worships. Demented!!!”

5. Context and background  
- Trump fired Comey in 2017 amid the FBI’s Russia‐collusion investigation; Comey later published a book and publicly criticized Trump’s ethics and fitness for office.  
- Separately, there have been two assassination attempts on Trump during the 2024 campaign:  
  • July 2024 rally in Pennsylvania – a gunman killed a bystander and grazed Trump’s ear.  
  • At Trump’s Florida golf course – a man was arrested outside with a gun; he faces charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and weapons charges (pleaded not guilty).

<Summary source="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/21/trump-habba-mciver-arrest-new-jersey/">
Here are the key points from Patrick Marley’s May 21 Washington Post article “Congresswoman’s charges fuel claims of intimidation of Trump critics”:

1. Recent high-profile law-enforcement actions  
   • April: DOJ arrested a Wisconsin circuit judge, Hannah Dugan, accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade federal agents.  
   • Three weeks later: Secret Service opened a probe into ex-FBI director James Comey over an alleged social-media “threat” against President Trump.  
   • This week: Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba charged Rep. La Monica McIver (D-NJ) with assaulting two federal agents outside a Newark immigration center.

2. Administration’s justification  
   • White House spokesman Harrison Fields: “Unlike Democrats, the administration is focused on investigating crimes regardless of who commits them.”  
   • Deputy AG Todd Blanche on social media: “This administration will always protect those who work tirelessly to keep America safe.”  
   • Habba: “No one is above the law — politicians or otherwise.” She says McIver was given “every opportunity” to resolve the matter short of charges.

3. Details of McIver’s alleged conduct  
   • May 9: McIver joined a congressional oversight tour at Delaney Hall detention center in Newark.  
   • Video (DHS-released) shows McIver rushing at agents as they moved to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka for trespassing, shouting to “surround the mayor.”  
   • In the crush, McIver’s elbows appear to contact a masked agent. She toured the facility for about an hour afterward.  
   • Habba told CNN she asked McIver to admit to wrongdoing; McIver refused.

4. Reactions and claims of political intimidation  
   • Erwin Chemerinsky (UC Berkeley Law dean): “It’s an attempt to intimidate potential critics” and unprecedented to arrest a judge, charge a member of Congress and probe a former FBI chief in this way.  
   • Eugene Volokh (UCLA emeritus First Amendment professor): Believes “plausible arguments” exist that the judge and congresswoman broke the law.  
   • McIver on CNN: Calls the charges “political intimidation” and vows not to be intimidated.  
   • Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ): Warns Habba’s actions against McIver set a “dangerous path” for members performing oversight.  
   • Republicans (Rep. Tom Cole, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene) say members of Congress have no special legal immunity; Greene even floated expulsion.  
   • House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries: Vows to block Habba’s confirmation as U.S. Attorney.

5. Broader fallout and political context  
   • Ras Baraka’s trespass charge is set to be dismissed; a hearing is scheduled. Baraka is running in the NJ Democratic gubernatorial primary.  
   • Possible charges may extend to Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Robert Menendez Jr., who were present.  
   • NJ Senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim (both Democrats) likely to withhold support (“blue slips”) for Habba’s nomination.  
   • NJ governor’s race viewed as a referendum on Trump; Baraka and Sherrill are among other Democratic contenders.

6. Parallel case: Judge Hannah Dugan  
   • Indicted on obstruction and concealment charges for allegedly helping an immigrant exit her courtroom to evade arrest.  
   • FBI Director Kash Patel posted a handcuffs photo on social media with the caption “no one is above the law.”  

No resolution yet on any of these cases; McIver’s and Dugan’s charges and the Comey probe are all ongoing.

Disclaimer: The extracted content appears incomplete and may not cover all twelve instances. Summary covers the available excerpts.

1. May 2017 – Urging Sessions to “un-recuse”  
   • According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ testimony in the Mueller report, President Trump privately asked Sessions to reverse his recusal so Sessions could direct DOJ “to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton,” including the Russia probe. Sessions did not comply.

2. November 2–3, 2017 – Public calls to investigate Hillary Clinton  
   • In a November 2 radio interview, Trump complained that, “because I’m the President… I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department,” and said he was “very frustrated” DOJ wasn’t probing Clinton’s emails or the Steele dossier.  
   • On November 3, Trump tweeted a multi-post thread urging the Justice Department and FBI to pursue “dishonesty… with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” insisting “the American public deserves it.”

3. November 2017 – Push for a “Uranium One” special counsel  
   • After Fox’s Jeanine Pirro lobbied Trump in the Oval Office, on November 13 Assistant AG Stephen Boyd informed Congress that Sessions had ordered senior prosecutors to consider appointing a special counsel to investigate Uranium One and Clinton Foundation dealings.  
   • On November 22, Sessions assigned U.S. Attorney John Huber (Utah) to this task.  
   • A March 29, 2018, letter from Sessions to lawmakers reported Huber was working “in cooperation with the Inspector General” and that Sessions received “regular updates.”

4. Late 2018–January 2020 – Whitaker intervenes in Huber probe  
   • After firing Sessions in November 2018, Trump installed Matthew Whitaker as acting AG. According to the Washington Post, Whitaker “tried to push Huber to be more aggressive,” but Huber believed he had exhausted all lines of inquiry.  
   • By January 2020, the Huber investigation “effectively ended with no tangible results.” Trump later derided Huber on Twitter as a “garbage disposal unit.”

5. January 2018–January 2021 – Extended Clinton Foundation inquiry  
   • The New York Times reported that, at Trump’s urging, FBI agents reopened questions about the Clinton Foundation in early 2018. Little Rock prosecutors issued a grand jury subpoena for foundation records; FBI personnel examined donor records and interviewed the foundation’s former CFO.  
   • Charlie Savage of the New York Times noted in 2023 that the DOJ kept this “dead end” investigation open throughout Trump’s term, finally closing it on January 8 and 15, 2021.

6. March 2018 – Firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe  
   • On March 16, 2018, Andrew McCabe was abruptly dismissed. The next day Trump tweeted, “Andrew Mc Cabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI – A great day for Democracy,” adding that “Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss.”

Query: Summarize recent legal investigations or law enforcement actions that might lead to James Comey’s arrest, including developments since the seashells photo inquiry. I’m particularly interested in any credible reports of subpoenas, warrants, or charges being prepared.

**James Comey’s ‘8647’ Post Forced FBI Agents Off of Terror and Child Trafficking Cases [WATCH]**
James Comey's Instagram post, which showed seashells arranged to display the number '8647', has been criticized for causing a wave of copycat threats targeting President Trump. According to FBI Director Kash Patel, the post led to a flood of tips to the FBI's tip line about people putting '8647' because of Comey's actions. Patel stated that the bureau has been forced to pause or reassign investigative efforts related to high-priority criminal cases, such as child sex predators and terrorists, because of the surge in threats. Dan Bongino, a Fox News host, criticized Comey's handling of the situation, saying that he is a 'disgrace to the badge, the FBI and the country.' Comey has dismissed the federal response as a distraction orchestrated by the Trump administration and claimed to have no regrets about the post, stating that the image was captured after his wife noticed the shell arrangement during a walk on the beach. Despite this explanation, federal officials have taken the matter seriously, particularly in light of two recent assassination attempts targeting President Trump.

**Trump Threatened with Death, but Police Believe ICE Was Deceived**
A man named Ramon Morales Reyes (54) was arrested after sending a threatening letter to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the US Secret Service, allegedly signed by him, threatening to kill President Donald Trump. However, according to CNN, the police believe that ICE has been deceived and that Reyes did not write the letter. Instead, they think that the letter was written and sent by a person who is accused of robbery and assault against Reyes, with the goal of getting him deported before the trial. The threat against Trump is not considered credible, and analysis of Reyes' handwriting shows that he did not write the letter. A person connected to the case called from a US prison and asked for information about addresses that later received the letter. The Milwaukee police are investigating a case of identity theft and threat against a witness related to the incident, but no one has been charged. Reyes was arrested in Wisconsin and is awaiting deportation. He is not charged with the threat against Trump. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, Reyes has entered the US illegally nine times between 1998 and 2005 and has a criminal record. 'The threat comes less than a year after President Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania, and less than two weeks after former FBI Director Comey advocated for an attack on the president,' said Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in a statement. 'This illegal alien who threatened to kill President Trump is a menace to society and a threat to national security,' she added. However, former FBI Director James Comey has been criticized for a post on Instagram where he used a code to threaten Trump. The post showed a picture of a sandcastle with the numbers 8647, which is a slang term for 'to remove' or 'to kill.' Comey later deleted the post and denied any intention to threaten Trump.

**US investigating 'threat' to Trump by ex-FBI chief Comey**
US law enforcement agencies are investigating an alleged assassination threat against President Donald Trump made by former FBI director James Comey. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the investigation after Comey made a now-deleted post on Instagram that showed an image of '86 47' spelled out in sea shells, with '86' being slang for kill and Trump the 47th president. Noem stated, 'DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.' Comey later claimed the post was 'a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message.' However, he acknowledged that some people may have associated the numbers with violence and took the post down. Trump has faced other threats, including an assassination attempt in July 2024 that left him wounded in the ear.

**Trump FBI Chief Kash Patel Says He's Got Agents Chasing 'Copycat Threats' After Comey '86 47' Seashell Flap**
FBI Director Kash Patel stated on Fox News that he has reassigned agents from investigating drug interdiction and sex crimes to pursue 'copycat threats' following the controversy surrounding former FBI Director James Comey's Instagram post featuring seashells spelling out the numbers '86' and '47'. Comey's post drew criticism from Trump, leading to a Secret Service threat interview at his home. Patel said, 'I've taken resources away from drug interdiction and sex crimes to investigate these copycats.'

**Ex-Biden aides face Thursday deadline to comply with autopen probe**
House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is leading an investigation into whether President Biden used an autopen to sign executive actions without his direct involvement. The committee is focusing on 32 clemency warrants issued using an autopen out of 57 total pardons and commutations during Biden's presidency. Former Biden aides, including Anthony Bernal, Annie Tomasini, Neera Tanden, Ashley Williams, and Dr. Kevin O'Connor, have been contacted by the committee and are expected to comply by Thursday evening. If they do not, the committee will issue subpoenas. Republicans argue that the autopen's use becomes constitutionally questionable if the president didn't authorize it personally. A Biden spokesperson has pushed back on reporting about his mental acuity, saying 'evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.' The investigation is also looking into whether Biden's health issues may have affected his ability to make decisions. 'The American people deserve to know who was calling the shots,' Comer said. 'We expect all witnesses to fully comply with the Committee's investigation. The Committee will issue subpoenas if necessary,' a source said.

A patrol from the Investigation and Inquiry Section and the Bent Jbail Office arrested a man identified as 'R.F.' in the town of Tibnin, based on information provided by the Nabatieh Regional Directorate.

**Kash Patel Rages at James Comey Over Cryptic Trump Post**
FBI Director Kash Patel launched a scathing rebuke against former FBI Chief James Comey, saying, 'I won't be lectured on how to run the FBI by that man.' Patel claimed that Comey's Instagram post of seashells that spelled out the numbers '86' and '47' was a threat to President Donald Trump and led to 'copycat' threats. Comey explained that he thought the shells displayed a nonviolent message, but Patel said it was a 'beachside venture' that caused him headaches. Patel claimed that Comey's post led to multiple investigations and took agents away from more important cases, such as child sex predators and terrorists. Comey said he was interviewed by the Secret Service but doesn't expect the investigation to go anywhere.

**US Detains Mexican National for Alleged Threat to Shoot President Trump**
US authorities have arrested a 54-year-old Mexican national, Ramón Morales Reyes, for allegedly threatening to shoot President Donald Trump in a handwritten letter sent to an ICE agent last week. According to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, 'Thanks to our ICE agents, this illegal immigrant (...) is behind bars.' Morales Reyes is currently being held by ICE in the Dodge County Jail in Juneau, Wisconsin, awaiting deportation proceedings. The letter, published by the Department of Noem, promised to 'self-deport back to Mexico' after using a '30 yard 6' (a rifle cartridge) to shoot the 'beloved president in the head' at one of his 'big rallies.' The letter also claimed that 'we Mexicans have done more for this country than you whites,' and that Trump 'deserves his due.' Noem has pointed out the recent attempt on Trump's life and the alleged call to murder him by former FBI Director James Comey, who denied the motivation behind a photo of seashells on a beach shared on his personal Instagram. Noem has stated that 'all politicians and media members should take note of these repeated attempts on the president's life and moderate their rhetoric,' and that she will continue to take 'all necessary measures' to 'ensure the president's protection.'

**Man Detained for Launching Fireworks at Sea Lions in Valdivia**
A 20-year-old man was detained in Valdivia for launching fireworks at sea lions on the city's waterfront. The police's Environmental and Cultural Heritage Crimes Investigation Brigade (BIDEMA) seized two shotguns during the operation and the individual faces charges for animal cruelty, illegal possession of firearms, unjustified discharges, and unauthorized use of fireworks. The arrest was made in La Unión and coordinated with the Public Ministry. According to BIDEMA Valdivia Comisaria Analia Neira, 'The personal from BIDEMA Valdivia worked together with the Public Ministry, performing an entry and search in a residence in the La Unión commune, where the detention of a 20-year-old male person was achieved, linked to an investigation for the crimes of animal cruelty, illegal possession of a firearm, unjustified discharges, and activation of fireworks without authorization.' The prosecutor, Carlos Bahamondes, linked the crimes of illegal possession of a firearm and unjustified discharges to the same moment of animal cruelty, as the suspect was recorded firing a firearm from a moving vehicle. 'The subject was identified and it was determined not only his participation in that fact, but also in other delinquent acts. As a result, the Los Ríos Prosecutor's Office requested an arrest warrant,' said the prosecutor. The defendant will be taken into custody tomorrow at the Valdivia Guarantee Court.

**CNN Analyst Says Comey's Trump Post Does Merit Formal Investigation: 'Very, Very Dangerous'**
CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow stated that a post from former FBI Director James Comey, featuring seashells arranged as the numbers '86 47,' warrants a formal investigation. Wackrow called the post 'both disappointing and alarming' due to the potential for violence, citing President Trump's recent targeted political violence and the culture of assassination in the US. He emphasized that Comey's broad social media reach could inspire violence against the president or his family, making the situation 'very, very dangerous.'

**DHS and Secret Service probe Comey’s shell post amid accusations of inciting violence**
Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Secret Service for a social media post that some accused of inciting violence. Comey posted a picture of seashells with the caption '86', which some interpreted as a reference to assassination. However, Comey claimed he was unaware of the potential meaning and took the post down. The reaction from the right was swift, with some calling for Comey to be put in jail. John Miller, a law enforcement analyst, stated that the term '86' does not fit the legal standard of a threat and questioned whether the investigation is a form of 'government weaponization theater'.

Deputy White House Chief of Staff Dan Scavino also commented on X, accusing James Comey of 'inciting criminals/terrorists to kill the current US President during his foreign trip', referring to Trump's current trip to the Middle East. 'It was a great day' for inciting violence, Scavino said, implying that Comey's actions were a threat to Trump's safety. The investigation will look into a photo of seashells that is believed to be a threat to Trump.

**US Investigates Ex-FBI Director James Comey for Potential Threat Against Trump**
US authorities and security agencies are investigating a potential threat against President Donald Trump made by former FBI Director James Comey, according to Interior Secretary Kristi Noem. The investigation stems from a post on Comey's Instagram, which showed a photo of seashells with the numbers '86' and '47' formed by the shells. '86' is a slang term for 'kill' and '47' refers to Trump's number as President of the United States. Noem wrote on X, 'The former FBI Director James Comey instigated the assassination of @POTUS Trump.' The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service are investigating the threat and will respond accordingly. Comey later clarified that the post was just a photo of seashells he saw on a beach walk, and that he didn't intend for the numbers to be associated with violence. However, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard has called for Comey's arrest, saying, 'James Comey should be held accountable and locked up for this.'

**James Comey investigated over seashell photo claimed to be ‘threat’ against Trump**
Former FBI director James Comey is being investigated by the US Secret Service over a photo of seashells he posted on Instagram, which Republicans claim is a 'threat' against Trump. The photo, which features 8 shells in a formation resembling the number '8647', was deleted by Comey, but not before it sparked outrage among Republicans. According to FOX News, White House officials condemned the post as an attempt to 'put a hit' on the president. Representative Nancy Mace also expressed her outrage, stating that Comey's post was 'issuing a call to assassinate' Trump. Education Secretary Linda McMahon dismissed the controversy, saying that the post was 'just a photo of seashells'. The investigation is ongoing.

Forecaster_1 step 1 output:
Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

The sources provide a mix of factual information and political opinions regarding the Comey investigation:

**Factual Sources (High Credibility):**
- FBI Directors timeline: Official government documentation showing Comey's tenure (2013-2017) and dismissal by Trump
- BBC, NYT, UPI, CBS News articles: Credible news sources providing consistent factual reporting on the May 15-16, 2025 events. Key facts: Comey posted and deleted "8647" seashell photo, was voluntarily interviewed by Secret Service for ~90 minutes on May 16, returned home same day
- Hanssen case: Official FBI account demonstrating that former FBI officials can be arrested, though for severe crimes (espionage)

**Opinion vs. Fact Separation:**
- Factual: Investigation is ongoing, Comey was interviewed, post was deleted
- Expert/Official Opinions: Secret Service spokesman saying they "take rhetoric like this very seriously"; legal definition from Nolo
- Political Opinions: Trump calling it "assassination," Gabbard saying Comey "should be jailed," Noem calling it a "threat" - these are political statements, not legal determinations

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible Reference Classes:**
1. Former FBI Directors: Extremely small sample (~20 total), only L. Patrick Gray faced charges (later dismissed)
2. High-ranking law enforcement officials investigated for alleged threats: More relevant but limited data
3. Public figures investigated for ambiguous social media posts: Broader but harder to quantify

**Most Suitable:** Former high-ranking law enforcement officials investigated for communications interpreted as threats. This balances relevance with available data while accounting for the unique prosecutorial considerations around law enforcement leadership.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Period:** 32 days (May 30 - July 1, 2025)

**Timeline Patterns:**
- Investigation began May 15-16, 2025 (2 weeks ago)
- Comey interviewed May 16 and released same day
- Historical precedent shows threatening communications cases typically resolve within weeks to months if charges are filed
- More serious law enforcement corruption cases often take years to develop

**(d) Justification:**

The base rate for arresting former FBI Directors is extremely low. Gray's case was unique (Watergate era, charges ultimately dismissed) and involved alleged Fourth Amendment violations, not social media posts. The Perplexity report shows that while some high-ranking law enforcement officials have been arrested, these typically involved clear corruption, obstruction, or civil rights violations - not ambiguous social media content.

Current investigative status suggests weak criminal case: Comey was interviewed voluntarily and released immediately, indicating insufficient evidence for immediate arrest. His explanation of innocent intent, combined with the ambiguous nature of "8647," creates reasonable doubt about criminal intent - the legal standard for threatening communications.

The 32-day timeframe is relatively short for developing a criminal case unless evidence is overwhelming. Political pressure exists but prosecutors typically require clear legal standards to proceed, especially against high-profile defendants where failure would be embarrassing.

**Outside view calibration:**

The historical base rate for arresting former FBI Directors approaches zero (0/~20). Expanding to high-ranking law enforcement officials, arrests occur but typically for serious crimes with clear evidence. The current case involves ambiguous social media content with an innocent explanation already provided.

The short timeframe (32 days) combined with Comey already being interviewed and released suggests the investigation is not progressing toward imminent arrest. While political pressure exists, the legal threshold for proving criminal intent in threatening communications cases is substantial.

Given the extremely low historical base rate, weak apparent evidence, and Comey's reasonable explanation, the probability should be quite low but not zero given the political climate and pressure for action.

**Outside View Prediction:**

Forecaster_2 step 1 output:
Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**FBI.gov sources** (directors list, Hanssen case): Highest quality - official government sources providing factual historical information. Key facts: Comey served as FBI Director 2013-2017; the Hanssen case shows former FBI officials can be arrested and prosecuted for crimes.

**Recent news sources** (BBC, NYT, CBS, UPI - all May 16, 2025): High-quality mainstream outlets reporting on the "seashells incident." Key facts: Comey posted then deleted Instagram photo of seashells arranged as "8647"; Secret Service interviewed him for ~90 minutes on May 16 at Washington field office; he voluntarily cooperated and was released same day. The sources contain many political opinions (from Trump, Trump Jr., Gabbard, Noem) that should be discounted as non-expert commentary, but the factual reporting about the investigation appears credible.

**Perplexity report**: Provides valuable historical context on arrests of former law enforcement officials. Quality appears good for background research, though I note this should be treated as supplementary. Key insight: arrests of high-ranking law enforcement officials are relatively rare and typically involve clear evidence of corruption, obstruction, or criminal activity.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

Possible reference classes:
1. **Former FBI Directors arrested**: Extremely small sample (only L. Patrick Gray, charges dismissed)
2. **Former high-ranking FBI officials arrested**: Small sample (Hanssen for espionage, Gray dismissed)
3. **Former high-ranking law enforcement officials arrested**: Larger sample including sheriffs/commissioners
4. **Individuals investigated by Secret Service for alleged presidential threats**

The most suitable reference class is #2-3 combined: former high-ranking law enforcement officials facing criminal charges. This provides enough historical data while maintaining relevance to Comey's position and circumstances.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

Prediction window: 32 days remaining (May 30 to July 1, 2025). The triggering incident occurred May 15, with Secret Service interview May 16 - we're now ~2 weeks past initial investigation with no reported follow-up action.

Historical patterns show investigations of high-ranking officials typically take months to years from incident to arrest (Kerik: ~2 years, Hanssen: years of investigation). However, alleged presidential threats would typically be handled more urgently if deemed credible.

**(d) Justification:**

The central question is whether arranging seashells spelling "8647" constitutes prosecutable criminal conduct. Legal elements for threatening the president require: (1) true threat, (2) intent to threaten, (3) transmission of threat.

**Factors suggesting arrest unlikely:**
- Weak evidentiary foundation: seashell arrangement highly ambiguous
- Comey's immediate deletion and explanation suggests lack of criminal intent
- He voluntarily cooperated with Secret Service and was released same day
- No reported investigative activity in 2+ weeks since interview
- Historical prosecutions of former FBI leadership extremely rare and typically involve clear criminal conduct (espionage, corruption, obstruction)

**Factors suggesting possible arrest:**
- High-level political pressure from multiple administration officials
- Political weaponization of law enforcement apparatus
- Comey's status as prominent Trump critic may lower prosecutorial threshold

The lack of action in the 2+ weeks since the Secret Service interview, combined with the legally questionable nature of the underlying conduct, suggests authorities are unlikely to pursue criminal charges.

**Outside View Calibration:**

The historical base rate for arrests of former FBI directors/senior officials appears extremely low - effectively 0% for comparable circumstances. Even including broader law enforcement leadership, arrests typically involve clear evidence of traditional crimes (corruption, obstruction, espionage).

The seashells incident represents a much weaker legal case than historical precedents. While political considerations might lower normal prosecutorial standards, the evidentiary challenges and First Amendment concerns would make prosecution risky.

Given 32 days remaining and no apparent investigative momentum since May 16, the probability appears quite low. However, I must account for the political volatility and unprecedented nature of targeting former FBI leadership.

**Outside View Prediction:**

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- FBI “Directors, Then and Now” (FBI.gov): Primary‐source, high reliability for leadership chronology. No opinions.  
- FBI Hanssen case summary (FBI.gov): Primary‐source summary of an espionage arrest. Reliable for illustrating that even egregious counterintelligence crimes were pursued. Not directly analogous (Hanssen wasn’t a director), but shows the Bureau will arrest former insiders for clear statutory violations.  
- BBC, UPI, New York Times, CBS articles (May 16, 2025) on Comey’s “86-47” Instagram post: All mainstream outlets with on‐the‐record quotes from Secret Service, DHS, FBI officials, Trump and family, and legal experts. Facts: a voluntary interview by Comey, the post’s deletion, and official statements that an investigation is under way. Opinions: Calls to “jail” or “respond appropriately” are political commentary, not legal determinations. No credible reporting of formal charges or arrest to date.  
- Perplexity report on ex–law-enforcement arrests: Aggregates several well‐documented cases (Kerik, Carona, Baca, Arpaio) sourced to DOJ filings and court records. Useful for broader context of high‐level arrests, but these involve corruption or civil-rights abuses in local law enforcement, not defamation, threat or social-media posts.

2. Reference‐class analysis  
Possible classes:  
a. Ex-FBI Directors arrested after leaving office. Population: ~9 living ex‐directors (Flynn, Allen, Burns, Hoover, Gray, Kelley, Sessions, Freeh, Mueller, Comey). Arrests/indictments: only L. Patrick Gray indicted (charges later dismissed); zero convictions. Base‐rate ≈1/9 ≈11%, but that was a special Watergate prosecution and did not result in an arrest per se (Gray surrendered voluntarily to a grand jury). Convictions = 0. More relevant metric: actual custodial arrests ≈0/9 =0%.  
b. Former top federal law-enforcement or intelligence officials arrested any time post‐tenure. Additional cases: none besides Gray. Base‐rate ≈0%.  
c. Former state/local law-enforcement chiefs (commissioners, sheriffs) arrested for corruption or civil-rights abuses. Population >100 nationwide; arrests occurred ~5–10%. But their functions and incentive structures differ greatly from a former FBI Director.  
Most suitable reference class: ex-FBI directors (class size ~9–10; zero arrests).

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Time to resolution: 31 days (May 30 to July 1, 2025).  
- Historical pattern: High‐profile investigations that lead to arrest typically involve grand‐jury subpoenas, public indictments, and arrests early in the process, not a fortnight before a cutoff. The “86-47” case is only at an inquiry stage with interviews, no indictments or charging documents in evidence. At this late stage, an arrest would be anomalous.

4. Status-quo and expert expectations  
- Status-quo “no arrest” if investigations don’t proceed to charges.  
- Markets or expert chatter: No public odds in legal‐betting markets; media discourse focuses on political theater, not on realistic prospect of arrest.  
- DOJ independence: While political pressure exists, historically DOJ resists politically motivated prosecutions without clear probable cause.

Justification for outside view:  
– Reference‐class rate of actual arrests of ex‐FBI Directors: effectively zero.  
– Current investigation stage is preliminary (voluntary interview, no public charging documents).  
– Very short time window left.  
– No precedent for prosecuting a mere social‐media post without additional crimes.  
Hence the outside‐view probability that Comey will be arrested by July 1, 2025 is extremely low.

Outside view calibration:  
Given a base‐rate near 0% and negligible inside‐view signals, I assign a small probability to capture unforeseeable political or legal shocks—on the order of 1%.

Outside View Prediction:  
1% confidence that James Comey will be arrested before July 1, 2025.

Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source Analysis  
- FBI Directors List (FBI.gov): A factual, high‐quality government summary of FBI leadership history; no opinions. Provides only context on Comey’s tenure and the rarity of ex‐director legal jeopardy.  
- Robert Hanssen Case (FBI.gov): A detailed, credible FBI account of a former special agent’s arrest for espionage—useful to show that even serious counterintelligence betrayals can lead to arrests, but Hanssen was never a Director. Factual.  
- BBC / UPI / NYT / CBS News on the “86 47” Instagram Investigation (May 2025): Mainstream‐media reporting of Comey’s voluntary Secret Service interview. Quality: high for facts, but includes political commentary (e.g., Trump, Gabbard, Noem). Opinions are identified and originate from named actors; factual core is that he was questioned, not arrested.  
- Perplexity Report on Arrests of Former Law Enforcement Leaders: A mixed‐quality summary combining official records and secondary reporting. Useful reference class of high‐rank arrests (e.g., Gray, Kerik, Carona, Baca, Arpaio). Factual elements appear credible, but treat as indicative rather than definitive.

2. Reference Class Analysis  
- Ex-FBI Directors Arrested: N = 1 (acting Director Gray indicted in 1978, charges later dismissed; no full‐director arrest). Suitability: very small sample, suggests near‐zero base rate.  
- Former Top US Law Enforcement Arrests: Cases of police commissioners/sheriffs (Kerik, Carona, Baca, Arpaio) yield ~5 arrests over ~40 years; average frequency ~0.1 arrests/year in the US for comparable rank. None occurred within 1 month of public controversy.  
- Public Figures Under Threat Investigation: Politically charged Secret Service inquiries seldom lead to arrest absent clear criminal evidence; historical probability of arresting someone for an ambiguous social‐media post is near zero.

Most suitable reference class: “Former top‐tier US law enforcement leaders facing federal investigations.” Base-rate annual arrest probability ~2–3% for the entire class, but probability in any given 1-month window ~0.2%.

3. Timeframe Analysis  
- Forecast horizon: 32 days (May 30–July 1, 2025).  
- Historical pattern: In the reference class, arrests follow multi-year probes for major corruption or espionage. None occur abruptly within weeks of a first inquiry. Random arrests for non‐related offenses (e.g., DUI) among high‐profile individuals might occur but are rare (~1% per year), implying ~0.1% in 1 month.

4. Justification and Integration  
- Ex-director arrests: effectively zero historical precedents.  
- The “86 47” investigation: public, but voluntary cooperation and deletion of the post dramatically reduce arrest likelihood. Secret Service and FBI statements emphasize investigation, not charges.  
- Random arrest risk (DUI, misdemeanor): small but non‐negligible; however, high‐profile status and resources further lower that risk.  
- Combining: near‐zero reference‐class base rate for arrests of similar persons on this short a horizon, plus a small tail risk of unrelated misdemeanor arrest.  

Outside view calibration:  
- Base rate (reference class of ex–high-rank law-enforcement figures): ~0.2% chance within a 1-month period.  
- Add small tail for random arrest (e.g., traffic offense): +0.1%.  
- Adjust up slightly for ongoing political investigation (but no clear probable cause): +0.1%.  
- Total outside view probability ~0.4%.

Outside View Prediction: 0.4%

I would round to the nearest 1% significance:  
Given the very low base rate, I assign a 1% probability that James Comey will be arrested before July 1, 2025.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
•  FBI “Directors, Then and Now” page – Official U.S. government historical list. Purely factual (names, dates, statutory changes).  High‐quality; no opinions.  
•  FBI “Robert Hanssen” case file – Official narrative of a notorious spy; factual description of investigative chronology.  High‐quality; no opinions relevant to Comey but useful for arrest-timeline benchmarks.  
•  BBC article (16 May 2025) – Mainstream global outlet; reports the seashell-photo episode, quotes principal actors (Trump, Secret Service). Separates fact (post, interview) from political opinion (Republicans’ interpretation).  Credible.  
•  UPI article (16 May 2025) – Wire service with moderate fact-checking standards. Mostly factual quotations from DHS, Secret Service, Tulsi Gabbard.  Some partisan colour but opinions clearly attributed.  
•  NY Times article (16 May 2025) – High-quality national paper; gives detailed chronology, stresses that Comey went voluntarily and returned home.  Clear line between reported fact and officials’ statements.  
•  CBS News article (16 May 2025) – Major U.S. broadcaster; facts align with NYT. Adds duration of Secret Service interview (≈90 min).  Credible.  
•  Perplexity arrest survey – Secondary synthesis compiling open-source material on past arrests of senior U.S. law-enforcement figures.  Provides names, dates and legal outcomes with citations.  Good for reference-class counts but, being AI-generated, should be spot-checked; treat as medium quality, factual content only where independently verifiable.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes (with rough counts since 1970):  
1. Former FBI directors (n ≈ 10 who have lived part of their post-tenure lives).  Known arrests/indictments ≈ 1 (Acting Dir. L. Patrick Gray, 1978).  Lifetime arrest rate ≈ 10%.  
2. Former senior U.S. federal law-enforcement chiefs (FBI directors, ATF directors, DEA administrators, DHS secretaries, U.S. attorneys general, etc.) – roughly 150 people; arrests/indictments ≈ 8-10 → lifetime rate ≈ 5-7%.  
3. Persons publicly investigated for threatening a U.S. president (Secret Service “protective intelligence” cases).  Tens of thousands of investigations annually; only a few hundred arrests (<<1%).  However, essentially none involve a person of Comey’s stature.  

Suitability: Class 1 is narrowest and matches institutional role; data quality is adequate; therefore adopt Class 1 as primary reference, with Class 2 used as a sensitivity check.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days until close: 32 (30 May 2025 → 1 Jul 2025).  
Historical pattern: the single ex-FBI-director indictment (Gray) came six years after his tenure and began with a grand-jury indictment, not a sudden custodial arrest.  His initial court appearance occurred in December 1978—roughly eight months after public reporting of a DOJ probe.  No precedent for an arrest of a former director occurring within a single month of an incident.  Using Class 1 history: 1 arrest over roughly 3,000 post-service person-months (21 directors × ~12 years average out-of-office) → base monthly arrest probability ≈ 0.03%.

(d) Justification  
•  Base-rate mathematics (0.03%/month) is already extremely low.  
•  The window under consideration is only one month; multiplying an annualised ex-director arrest probability of ~0.3–0.4% by 1/12 yields ≈0.03%.  
•  The single live investigation publicly acknowledged (seashell post) so far produced just a voluntary interview; there was no detention, weapons seizure, or public statement of probable cause—all of which normally precede a custodial arrest for presidential-threat statutes (18 U.S.C. § 871).  
•  Secret Service investigations often close with a “no further action” letter, not charges, particularly when the subject is cooperative and represented by counsel.  
•  Political pressure alone seldom overcomes the evidentiary bar DOJ must meet to arrest a high-profile former official; recent history (e.g., failed Hunter Biden gun charge in 2023, McCabe non-prosecution decision 2020) suggests prosecutors tread carefully.  
•  Therefore, purely on outside-view grounds—ignoring any inside specifics that might later change—the chance of Comey being arrested in the next 32 days remains minuscule.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: empirical base rate ≈0.03% for a one-month window.  
Uncertainty multiplier: acknowledge data sparsity (only one historical event) and potential undercounting; widen by a factor of 3 on the upside (0.09%) and 2 on the downside (0.015%).  Mid-point ≈0.05%.  
Round to nearest 0.01 to avoid false precision, then broaden slightly (recognising possible unique political climate) → 0.10% feels like a conservative but still “outside-view” figure—an order of magnitude above the raw base yet still <1%.

Outside View Prediction:
0.1 % (i.e., one chance in a thousand) that James Comey is arrested before 1 July 2025.

Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**High-Quality Sources:**
- NBC News (May 16, 2025): Reliable reporting. **Factual**: Comey posted/deleted "8647" seashell Instagram photo, DHS/Secret Service investigating, official statements from Secretary Noem and Secret Service spokesperson. **Opinion**: Political reactions interpreting post as threat.
- BBC (May 16, 2025): Credible source. **Factual**: Same core facts, investigation ongoing. **Opinion**: Political characterizations of threat level.
- Washington Post (May 21, 2025): Established outlet. **Factual**: Pattern of law enforcement actions against Trump critics including Comey investigation. **Opinion**: Analysis about potential intimidation campaign.

**Recent Updates (May 29-30, 2025):**
- Multiple sources report **Factual**: Kash Patel confirms ongoing investigation, agents reassigned to copycat threats, Comey interviewed by Secret Service at his home. **Opinion**: Patel's criticism and political rhetoric.

**Political Sources:**
- Rep. Ogles letter: **Factual**: Congressman requested investigation. **Opinion**: His interpretation that "86 47" constitutes assassination threat.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple reliable sources confirm Comey was interviewed by Secret Service and NOT arrested (suggests insufficient evidence for immediate detention)
- 2+ weeks have elapsed since investigation began with no arrest despite active investigation
- Historical precedent: Essentially 0% arrest rate for former FBI Directors in modern era

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Ongoing investigation with FBI resources actively devoted
- Political pressure from multiple Trump administration officials calling for arrest
- Current FBI Director publicly criticizing Comey, indicating continued focus

**Weak Evidence:**
- Political rhetoric about what should happen (not predictive of actual law enforcement action)
- "Copycat threats" investigation tangentially related but unclear impact on Comey's legal status

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

32 days remaining (May 30 - July 1, 2025)

If halved (16 days): Probability would decrease to ~3% - insufficient time to build case if none exists
If doubled (64 days): Probability would increase to ~8% - more time for investigation development, but limited by weak underlying evidence

**(d) Justification:**

The outside view base rate of 7% already incorporated the extremely low historical precedent for arresting former FBI Directors. Current evidence suggests this should be adjusted downward:

**Key factors reducing probability:**
- Comey was interviewed and released - if they had strong evidence, arrest would have occurred then
- Two weeks have passed since investigation began with no arrest despite active political pressure
- The underlying evidence remains weak: ambiguous social media post with innocent explanation provided

**Factors maintaining some risk:**
- This is Trump's politicized DOJ with appointees potentially willing to arrest on weaker evidence than normal
- Intense political pressure continues
- Investigation remains active with resources devoted

However, prosecutors still need evidence that could survive court scrutiny. The fact that Comey was interviewed and walked free suggests the legal case remains weak.

**Probability Calibration:**

Adjusting outside view downward from 7% to 5% based on:
- Strong evidence that immediate arrest opportunity was passed up
- Time elapsed without action despite political pressure
- Continued weak underlying evidence
- But maintaining some probability due to political factors and remaining time

**Checklist:**
1. Paraphrase: Will James Comey be arrested (taken into custody against his will) before July 1, 2025 (32 days)?
2. Base rate: 7% outside view, adjusted to 5% based on current evidence
3. Consistency: "5 out of 100 times, James Comey gets arrested in next 32 days" - reasonable given weak evidence but political pressure
4. Key evidence: Already interviewed/not arrested (strong), 2+ weeks elapsed (strong), low historical base rate (strong), political pressure (moderate), ongoing investigation (moderate)
5. Blind spot: Political arrest on weak evidence or new incriminating evidence emerges
6. Status quo: No arrest despite 2+ weeks suggests trend toward no arrest

**Probability: 5%**
Predicted Probability: 5.0%

Output:
Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**High-quality mainstream sources (NBC, BBC, Washington Post):** These provide reliable reporting with direct official quotes. Facts include: DHS/Secret Service opened investigation into Comey's "8647" seashell Instagram post (May 15-16), Comey voluntarily interviewed by Secret Service, post was deleted. Opinions include political calls for arrest from Republican officials, but these are clearly labeled as political reactions, not legal determinations.

**Government sources (Rep. Ogles letter, official statements):** Primary sources showing real political pressure. Facts: formal congressional letter requesting investigation under 18 U.S.C. §§ 871, 875; confirmed statements from DHS Secretary Noem, FBI Director Patel. Opinions: Interpretations that "86 47" constitutes assassination threat.

**Recent reporting (Asknews articles, May 29-30):** Multiple sources confirming investigation ongoing but no charges filed. Facts: Comey interviewed at home, FBI Director Patel claiming resource reallocation to investigate "copycat threats." Key quote from Comey: he "doesn't expect the investigation to go anywhere."

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple independent sources confirm active Secret Service/DHS investigation (NBC, BBC, government statements)
- Direct confirmation from current officials (Noem, Patel, Guglielmi) of ongoing probe
- Comey's own acknowledgment of Secret Service interview

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Historical pattern of Trump administration pursuing investigations of critics (Washington Post chronology)
- Current political pressure from Republican officials demanding arrest
- FBI Director Patel's public criticism and claims about investigation impact

**Weak Evidence:**
- Anecdotal claims about "copycat threats" without independent verification
- Political rhetoric calling for arrest (opinions rather than legal analysis)
- No evidence of grand jury activity, subpoenas, or formal charging documents

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**
32 days remaining (May 30 to July 1, 2025). If halved to 16 days, arrest probability would decrease significantly due to insufficient time for legal processes. If doubled to 64 days, might marginally increase probability but investigation has shown no escalation beyond preliminary interview stage after 2+ weeks.

**(d) Justification:**
The outside view of 1% was based on zero historical arrests of former FBI Directors and preliminary investigation status. Current factors moderately increase this probability:

**Upward pressure:** Active confirmed investigation, significant political pressure from Trump administration, historical pattern of pursuing critics, current FBI Director's public criticism.

**Downward pressure:** No evidence of formal charges being prepared, voluntary rather than custodial interview, legal experts questioning threat threshold, extremely short timeframe for complex legal process.

The most compelling factor is that after 2+ weeks, this remains at preliminary investigation stage with no charging documents or grand jury activity—typical precursors to arrest. Comey's own assessment that he doesn't expect it to proceed carries weight given his legal background.

**Probability Calibration:**
Adjusting upward from 1% outside view to account for active investigation and political pressure, but constrained by lack of formal legal process indicators and short timeframe. The 32-day window makes a complex federal prosecution extremely unlikely without evidence of imminent charges.

**Checklist:**
1. **Criteria:** Will Comey be arrested anywhere, for any reason, before July 1, 2025 (32 days)?
2. **Base rate:** 1% (zero former FBI Director arrests historically)
3. **Consistency:** "4 out of 100 times, Comey gets arrested before July 1" - reasonable given investigation but no charges
4. **Key evidence:** Active Secret Service investigation confirmed; voluntary interview completed; no formal charges evident; 32-day legal process window very short; Comey expects no action
5. **Blind spot:** Surprise federal charges based on broader investigation beyond Instagram post
6. **Status quo:** Investigation continues without arrest or closes without charges

**Probability: 4%**
Predicted Probability: 4.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
   Will former FBI Director James Comey be taken into custody (arrested anywhere in the world, for any reason) by credible sources before July 1, 2025?

2. Source analysis  
   a. NBC News (May 16): High-quality mainstream report on DHS/Secret Service protective-intelligence probe and a 90-minute interview. Factual; no charges filed.  
   b. BBC (May 16): Independent confirmation of the probe; similar details. Factual.  
   c. U.S. Department of Homeland Security & Secret Service statements: Official sources confirming the protective-intelligence investigation (moderate reliability for predicting prosecution decisions).  
   d. Rep. Andy Ogles letter & political reactions: Partisan calls for investigation; reflect political pressure but carry little legal weight (weak).  
   e. Historical cases (former FBI officials like Hanssen, Gray; Kerik as NYC Police Commissioner; broader law-enforcement leadership): Shows that arrests of ex-senior law-enforcement figures require clear evidence of grave wrongdoing and often take months or years (strong).

3. Evidence analysis  
   Strong evidence  
   – Historical base rate: Practically zero arrests of former FBI directors or equivalent for ambiguous conduct (e.g., posting seashells).  
   Moderate evidence  
   – DHS/Secret Service opened a probe and briefly interviewed Comey, but have not requested warrants or filed charges in 2+ weeks.  
   Weak evidence  
   – Public/political calls for “perp-walk” by Trump allies; CNN analysts urging formal probe. These are rhetorical, not prosecutorial, pressures.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – Prediction window: 32 days (May 30 to July 1, 2025).  
   – Halved (16 days): even less time for DOJ/USSS to gather evidence, seek indictments, and execute an arrest warrant; probability would drop further.  
   – Doubled (64 days): still a short period for developing a prosecutable case against a high-profile former official; probability would rise modestly but remain low.

5. Justification  
   – Outside-view base rate: Almost no precedent for arresting a former FBI director based on tenuous evidence; historical arrests of ex-senior officials involve solid criminal acts (espionage, corruption).  
   – Inside-view adjustments: Although there is an active protective-intelligence investigation, the underlying conduct (an ambiguous Instagram photo of shells) fails legal threats-against-the-President standards (First Amendment risk, intent hard to prove). No subpoenas, warrants, or indictments have emerged. Political noise is intense but unlikely to overcome procedural and constitutional hurdles.  
   – Net shift: Small upward adjustment from near-zero base rate to account for unprecedented political weaponization but constrained by weak evidentiary foundation and very short timeframe.

Probability calibration  
I anchor on an outside-view base rate near 1–3% for arrests of comparable ex-FBI leadership under ambiguous circumstances. Given the active but preliminary investigation and intense political heat, I modestly adjust upward but remain below 10%. A ~7% probability reflects a low-confidence but non-zero chance that a prosecutorial body swiftly pursues an unprecedented arrest.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Predict arrest of James Comey by July 1, 2025 under defined criteria.  
2. Outside view base rate: ~1–3% based on historical precedent for ex-FBI directors.  
3. Consistency: “7 out of 100 times, Comey is arrested.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Historical rarity of arresting ex-FBI directors (strong).  
   • Only a brief protective-intelligence probe, no charges (moderate).  
   • High political pressure but low legal traction (weak).  
5. Blind spot: A sudden, major classified-materials leak or uncovered evidence prompting immediate arrest.  
6. Status quo: Absent new incriminating evidence, situation likely stalls without charges.

Probability: 7%
Predicted Probability: 7.0%

Analysis:
Source analysis  
- FBI.gov on Directors: Authoritative, factual on Comey’s tenure and rarity of ex‐FBI‐director arrests.  
- Historical FBI cases (e.g., Hanssen): Official FBI records, credible but not directly analogous to a Director.  
- Mainstream media (NBC, BBC, WaPo, Straight Arrow): High‐quality reporting confirming only that DHS/Secret Service opened a “protective‐intelligence” inquiry and interviewed Comey voluntarily; no subpoenas or warrants reported. Opinions from politicians (e.g., Noem, Ogles, Trump Jr.) are identifiable but represent political demands, not legal findings.  
- Asknews aggregation: Repeats the above; mixed quality but adds no new evidence of pending charges or legal process.

Evidence analysis (weighting)  
- Investigation confirmed by multiple independent outlets (Strong): indicates only an inquiry, not grounds for arrest.  
- Voluntary interview, deletion of post, and denial of intent (Moderate): reduces likelihood of establishing probable cause.  
- Historical base‐rate of arrests for ex‐FBI Directors is zero; analogous high‐rank law‐enforcement arrest rate ~0.1–0.2% per month (Strong): anchors near zero.  
- Ambient political pressure for “accountability” (Weak–Moderate): may increase investigatory zeal but doesn’t equate to legal arrest absent evidence.  
- Tail risk of an unrelated misdemeanor or traffic arrest (Weak): small, but nonzero.

Timeframe analysis  
- Forecast window: 32 days (May 30–July 1, 2025).  
- Even if extended to 64 days, absent new evidence, the chance remains extremely low; halving the window similarly leaves near‐zero probability.

Justification  
- Outside‐view base rate: ~0.4% in a 1‐month window for an ex–high‐rank law‐enforcement figure to be arrested.  
- Adjustments: +0.1% for the active political investigation; +0.05% tail risk for an unrelated minor arrest.  
- Net adjusted probability ~0.55%; rounding to nearest whole percent yields 1%.  
- No credible signs of grand jury activity, charges, warrants, or sealed indictments; status quo overwhelmingly favors no arrest.

Probability calibration  
My inside‐view forecast (1%) remains close to the outside‐view base rate (~0.4%) given the weak legal grounding of the current inquiry and lack of any evidence of prosecutorial action. Even with political noise, there is no clear path to arrest in the next month, so I assign a 1% chance.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will ex‐FBI Director James Comey be arrested, anywhere for any reason, before July 1, 2025?  
2. Outside view base rate: ~0.4% per month for similar figures.  
3. Consistency: 1 out of 100 times, such an arrest occurs under similar circumstances.  
4. Key evidence: zero historic ex‐Director arrests; only an investigation and voluntary interview; ambiguous threat lacking clear probable cause; standard FBI restraint on politicized arrests.  
5. Blind spot: A sudden unrelated criminal allegation or sealed indictment could raise odds—currently no sign of such.  
6. Status quo: No arrest; expectation of slow‐moving legal processes.

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%

Analysis:
a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)
• RVMNews (30 May 25) – Low-tier conservative site; quotes FBI Dir. Patel’s Fox hit. Factual core: Patel says agents diverted to “copy-cat 8647” threats. Much commentary, limited hard facts.  
• Dagbladet (30 May 25, Norway) – Mid-quality tabloid summarising U.S. coverage of a Mexican national’s threat to Trump; tangential, only repeats Comey story.  
• NBC News, BBC, Straight Arrow News (16 May 25) – Mainstream outlets; report shell-photo, official statements by DHS Sec. Noem, Secret Service, FBI Dir. Patel, Comey. Clear fact / opinion separation.  
• Rep. Ogles letter (15 May 25) – Primary document calling for investigation; partisan but authentic.  
• Washington Post (21 May 25) – High-quality; places Comey probe in pattern of Trump-era prosecutions; factual context, quotes legal scholars.  
Overall, only one line of relevant factual content repeats: a Secret Service / DHS “protective-intelligence” investigation was opened; Comey has already sat for an interview; no warrants, subpoenas or charges have surfaced as of 30 May 25.

b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence  
• Secret Service publicly confirms investigation; Comey interviewed, then allowed to leave (NBC, BBC, CBS).  ⇒ suggests low immediacy of arrest.  
• No public filing of criminal complaint / warrant two weeks after incident (PACER, media silence).  ⇒ historically, §871 arrests follow within hours–days when pursued.  
Moderate evidence  
• Trump-aligned officials (Noem, Patel, Ogles) openly demand arrest and highlight “copy-cat” threats.  ⇒ raises political pressure.  
• Recent pattern of unusually aggressive prosecutions of critics (judge Dugan, Rep. McIver) within current DOJ (WaPo).  ⇒ barrier to high-profile arrests lower than normal.  
Weak evidence  
• Media pundits (CNN’s Wackrow) call post “dangerous”.  • Speculation that new “evidence” might emerge.  

c) Timeframe analysis  
32 days remain. §871 threat cases that do lead to arrest usually do so inside two weeks of initial contact; probability thereafter decays rapidly. If the window were doubled (to 64 days) I would raise the estimate only slightly (from 2 %→3 %) because most incremental risk lies in the first few weeks. If halved (16 days) I would cut roughly in half (to ~1 %).

d) Justification / adjustment from outside view  
Outside-view one-month arrest rate for ex-FBI directors ≈0.1 %.  
Upward pressures:  (i) active investigation already open (×4),  (ii) visible political appetite for headline arrests (×3).  
Downward/offsetting:  (iii) elapsed two-week lull post-interview (÷2),  (iv) exceedingly high institutional/PR cost of bad-faith arrest of a well-lawyered former director (÷1.5).  
0.1 % ×4 ×3 ÷2 ÷1.5 ≈ 0.4 %.  To reflect model uncertainty and possibility of a last-minute, optics-driven move, I round up to a generous 2 % (i.e., one chance in fifty).

Probability calibration
I expect that about 2 out of 100 comparable situations would end with Comey (or an equivalent ex-FBI chief) actually being taken into custody within the next month; 98 would not.  My subjective 90 % confidence interval is 0.3 %-6 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will former FBI Director James Comey be taken into custody (anywhere, any charge) before 1 Jul 2025?”  
2. Base rate: ~0.1 % one-month arrest chance for former FBI directors.  
3. Consistency – “2 of 100 times, Comey would be arrested before 1 Jul 25.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • No warrant/complaint filed two weeks after incident.  
   • Secret Service interview concluded without detention.  
   • Trump-aligned officials openly urge arrest.  
   • Administration has recently charged other high-profile critics.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden leak of new incriminating communications (e-mails, DMs) proving explicit threat; would spike chance above 50 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: default outcome is no arrest; short window favours status quo.

Probability: 2%

Output:
Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**High-Quality Sources:**
- NBC News (May 16, 2025): Reliable reporting. **Factual**: Comey posted/deleted "8647" seashell Instagram photo, DHS/Secret Service investigating, official statements from Secretary Noem and Secret Service spokesperson. **Opinion**: Political reactions interpreting post as threat.
- BBC (May 16, 2025): Credible source. **Factual**: Same core facts, investigation ongoing. **Opinion**: Political characterizations of threat level.
- Washington Post (May 21, 2025): Established outlet. **Factual**: Pattern of law enforcement actions against Trump critics including Comey investigation. **Opinion**: Analysis about potential intimidation campaign.

**Recent Updates (May 29-30, 2025):**
- Multiple sources report **Factual**: Kash Patel confirms ongoing investigation, agents reassigned to copycat threats, Comey interviewed by Secret Service at his home. **Opinion**: Patel's criticism and political rhetoric.

**Political Sources:**
- Rep. Ogles letter: **Factual**: Congressman requested investigation. **Opinion**: His interpretation that "86 47" constitutes assassination threat.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple reliable sources confirm Comey was interviewed by Secret Service and NOT arrested (suggests insufficient evidence for immediate detention)
- 2+ weeks have elapsed since investigation began with no arrest despite active investigation
- Historical precedent: Essentially 0% arrest rate for former FBI Directors in modern era

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Ongoing investigation with FBI resources actively devoted
- Political pressure from multiple Trump administration officials calling for arrest
- Current FBI Director publicly criticizing Comey, indicating continued focus

**Weak Evidence:**
- Political rhetoric about what should happen (not predictive of actual law enforcement action)
- "Copycat threats" investigation tangentially related but unclear impact on Comey's legal status

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

32 days remaining (May 30 - July 1, 2025)

If halved (16 days): Probability would decrease to ~3% - insufficient time to build case if none exists
If doubled (64 days): Probability would increase to ~8% - more time for investigation development, but limited by weak underlying evidence

**(d) Justification:**

The outside view base rate of 7% already incorporated the extremely low historical precedent for arresting former FBI Directors. Current evidence suggests this should be adjusted downward:

**Key factors reducing probability:**
- Comey was interviewed and released - if they had strong evidence, arrest would have occurred then
- Two weeks have passed since investigation began with no arrest despite active political pressure
- The underlying evidence remains weak: ambiguous social media post with innocent explanation provided

**Factors maintaining some risk:**
- This is Trump's politicized DOJ with appointees potentially willing to arrest on weaker evidence than normal
- Intense political pressure continues
- Investigation remains active with resources devoted

However, prosecutors still need evidence that could survive court scrutiny. The fact that Comey was interviewed and walked free suggests the legal case remains weak.

**Probability Calibration:**

Adjusting outside view downward from 7% to 5% based on:
- Strong evidence that immediate arrest opportunity was passed up
- Time elapsed without action despite political pressure
- Continued weak underlying evidence
- But maintaining some probability due to political factors and remaining time

**Checklist:**
1. Paraphrase: Will James Comey be arrested (taken into custody against his will) before July 1, 2025 (32 days)?
2. Base rate: 7% outside view, adjusted to 5% based on current evidence
3. Consistency: "5 out of 100 times, James Comey gets arrested in next 32 days" - reasonable given weak evidence but political pressure
4. Key evidence: Already interviewed/not arrested (strong), 2+ weeks elapsed (strong), low historical base rate (strong), political pressure (moderate), ongoing investigation (moderate)
5. Blind spot: Political arrest on weak evidence or new incriminating evidence emerges
6. Status quo: No arrest despite 2+ weeks suggests trend toward no arrest

**Probability: 5%**
Predicted Probability: 5.0%

Output:
Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**High-quality mainstream sources (NBC, BBC, Washington Post):** These provide reliable reporting with direct official quotes. Facts include: DHS/Secret Service opened investigation into Comey's "8647" seashell Instagram post (May 15-16), Comey voluntarily interviewed by Secret Service, post was deleted. Opinions include political calls for arrest from Republican officials, but these are clearly labeled as political reactions, not legal determinations.

**Government sources (Rep. Ogles letter, official statements):** Primary sources showing real political pressure. Facts: formal congressional letter requesting investigation under 18 U.S.C. §§ 871, 875; confirmed statements from DHS Secretary Noem, FBI Director Patel. Opinions: Interpretations that "86 47" constitutes assassination threat.

**Recent reporting (Asknews articles, May 29-30):** Multiple sources confirming investigation ongoing but no charges filed. Facts: Comey interviewed at home, FBI Director Patel claiming resource reallocation to investigate "copycat threats." Key quote from Comey: he "doesn't expect the investigation to go anywhere."

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple independent sources confirm active Secret Service/DHS investigation (NBC, BBC, government statements)
- Direct confirmation from current officials (Noem, Patel, Guglielmi) of ongoing probe
- Comey's own acknowledgment of Secret Service interview

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Historical pattern of Trump administration pursuing investigations of critics (Washington Post chronology)
- Current political pressure from Republican officials demanding arrest
- FBI Director Patel's public criticism and claims about investigation impact

**Weak Evidence:**
- Anecdotal claims about "copycat threats" without independent verification
- Political rhetoric calling for arrest (opinions rather than legal analysis)
- No evidence of grand jury activity, subpoenas, or formal charging documents

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**
32 days remaining (May 30 to July 1, 2025). If halved to 16 days, arrest probability would decrease significantly due to insufficient time for legal processes. If doubled to 64 days, might marginally increase probability but investigation has shown no escalation beyond preliminary interview stage after 2+ weeks.

**(d) Justification:**
The outside view of 1% was based on zero historical arrests of former FBI Directors and preliminary investigation status. Current factors moderately increase this probability:

**Upward pressure:** Active confirmed investigation, significant political pressure from Trump administration, historical pattern of pursuing critics, current FBI Director's public criticism.

**Downward pressure:** No evidence of formal charges being prepared, voluntary rather than custodial interview, legal experts questioning threat threshold, extremely short timeframe for complex legal process.

The most compelling factor is that after 2+ weeks, this remains at preliminary investigation stage with no charging documents or grand jury activity—typical precursors to arrest. Comey's own assessment that he doesn't expect it to proceed carries weight given his legal background.

**Probability Calibration:**
Adjusting upward from 1% outside view to account for active investigation and political pressure, but constrained by lack of formal legal process indicators and short timeframe. The 32-day window makes a complex federal prosecution extremely unlikely without evidence of imminent charges.

**Checklist:**
1. **Criteria:** Will Comey be arrested anywhere, for any reason, before July 1, 2025 (32 days)?
2. **Base rate:** 1% (zero former FBI Director arrests historically)
3. **Consistency:** "4 out of 100 times, Comey gets arrested before July 1" - reasonable given investigation but no charges
4. **Key evidence:** Active Secret Service investigation confirmed; voluntary interview completed; no formal charges evident; 32-day legal process window very short; Comey expects no action
5. **Blind spot:** Surprise federal charges based on broader investigation beyond Instagram post
6. **Status quo:** Investigation continues without arrest or closes without charges

**Probability: 4%**
Predicted Probability: 4.0%

1. Paraphrase  
   Will former FBI Director James Comey be taken into custody (arrested anywhere in the world, for any reason) by credible sources before July 1, 2025?

2. Source analysis  
   a. NBC News (May 16): High-quality mainstream report on DHS/Secret Service protective-intelligence probe and a 90-minute interview. Factual; no charges filed.  
   b. BBC (May 16): Independent confirmation of the probe; similar details. Factual.  
   c. U.S. Department of Homeland Security & Secret Service statements: Official sources confirming the protective-intelligence investigation (moderate reliability for predicting prosecution decisions).  
   d. Rep. Andy Ogles letter & political reactions: Partisan calls for investigation; reflect political pressure but carry little legal weight (weak).  
   e. Historical cases (former FBI officials like Hanssen, Gray; Kerik as NYC Police Commissioner; broader law-enforcement leadership): Shows that arrests of ex-senior law-enforcement figures require clear evidence of grave wrongdoing and often take months or years (strong).

3. Evidence analysis  
   Strong evidence  
   – Historical base rate: Practically zero arrests of former FBI directors or equivalent for ambiguous conduct (e.g., posting seashells).
