Analysis:
Historically, criminal charges against journalists in the U.S. have been relatively rare, though there have been notable exceptions tied to national security leaks and protected-source standoffs. Efforts to prosecute reporters often hinge on allegations of illegal possession or dissemination of classified information, or refusals to comply with subpoenas. Large-scale data from initiatives like the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker can help establish a baseline (outside view) by quantifying instances of arrests or charges over time. More recent political developments and public statements—particularly around the punishment of journalists for publishing leaked information—highlight the potential for greater prosecutorial aggressiveness and suggest we should remain attentive to any uptick. Gathering information on prior indictments, details of the charges, and subsequent legal outcomes will be key to calibrating expectations for 2025 and 2026.

<Summary source="https://theconversation.com/reporting-is-not-espionage-but-history-shows-that-journalists-doing-the-former-get-accused-of-the-latter-203020">
Here is a summary of the Conversation article “Reporting is not espionage – but history shows that journalists doing the former get accused of the latter” by Bill Kovarik (April 6, 2023):

Facts, statistics and objective measurements  
• April 2023: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich detained in Russia on espionage charges.  
• Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) data: since 1992, over 2,190 journalists killed worldwide; in nearly 80% of those cases, killers go free.  
• Council of Europe (March 2023): at least 12 journalists killed covering the war in Ukraine.  
• CPJ data: 19 Russian journalists currently imprisoned, about half arrested after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.  

Historical precedents of espionage charges against U.S. journalists in Soviet‑bloc countries  
• 1951: Associated Press reporter William Oatis tried in Czechoslovakia for “spying” after interviewing locals without government permission; case led to U.S.–Czechoslovakia diplomatic and trade embargoes; Oatis released in 1953 weakened by tuberculosis.  
• 1950: AP’s Leonard Kirschen arrested in Romania, held for ten years.  
• 1955–56: UP’s Endre Marton and his wife Ilona Marton arrested in Hungary, released and smuggled out in 1956–57.  
• 1986: U.S. News & World Report’s Nicholas Daniloff arrested in Moscow on espionage charges; later released.  

Journalist‑intelligence ties during WWII and the Cold War  
• Several hundred American journalists worked closely with the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies from WWII through the Cold War, per evidence from the Watergate era.  
• Virginia Hall (New York Post reporter) aided the French Resistance in WWII.  
• Norwegian reporter Erling Espeland performed similar resistance work.  
• Donald A. Allan (former New York Times) later admitted his CBS/UP roles were covers for CIA assignments.  

Named opinions from reliable sources  
• Jodie Ginsberg, CPJ president: Russia’s use of criminal charges “is part of an increasing crackdown on free and independent media.”  
• Society of Professional Journalists President G. Kelly Hawes (1996): opposed using journalism as cover for intelligence, saying it endangers sources and compromises integrity.  

Less‑reliable or contextual observations  
• Implicit in the history is an authoritarian tendency to equate newsgathering with espionage when it threatens state narratives.

Here’s a concise summary of the 2014 ACLU article “On Leak Prosecutions, Obama Takes it to 11. (Or Should We Say 526?)”:

• Context:  
  – Pulitzer‑winner James Risen faces potential jail under subpoena for reporting on a CIA operation in Iran.  
  – A 60 Minutes report noted the Obama administration has prosecuted eight national‑security “leakers” versus three under all previous presidents combined.  

• Key statistic:  
  – Since 2009, the Obama administration has secured 526 months of prison time for national‑security leak prosecutions—compared to just 24 months total under every prior presidency in U.S. history.  
  – Fully 420 of those months (35 years) were Chelsea Manning’s sentence.  

• Breakdown of leak cases and sentences:  
  Pre‑Obama:  
    • Daniel Ellsberg & Anthony Russo (1973): Charges dropped after Nixon’s misconduct came to light.  
    • Samuel Morison (1985): 24 months (later pardoned by Clinton).  
    • Larry Franklin (2005): 10 months in a halfway house + 100 hours of community service.

  Under Obama:  
    • Thomas Drake (2010): Espionage charges dropped; pled to a misdemeanor; 1 year probation. The trial judge called the government’s conduct “unconscionable.”  
    • Shamai Leibowitz (2010): 20 months. Sentencing judge admitted uncertainty over what harm was caused.  
    • Chelsea Manning (2013): 420 months (35 years)—the longest ever.  
    • John Kiriakou (2013): 30 months for exposing CIA torture.  
    • Donald Sachtleben (2013): 43 months—longest sentence in a civilian leak case.  
    • Stephen Kim (2014): 13 months for disclosing North Korea intelligence to a Fox News reporter.  
    • Jeffrey Sterling (2014): Case pending—alleged source for James Risen.  
    • Edward Snowden (2013–): Charges pending, carrying potential decades in prison.

• ACLU’s point:  
  “The modern national‑security state is more powerful than ever…it demands democratic accountability. The last and best source of that accountability is a free press. Tragically, that free press now has a 526‑month sentence to serve.”

<Summary source="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-releases-some-migrant-detainees-detention-facilities-reach-109-percent-capacity/">
Disclaimer: Summary is based solely on the CBS News article “ICE releases some migrant detainees as its detention facilities reach 109% capacity” by Camilo Montoya‑Galvez, February 5, 2025.

Key Facts & Statistics  
• As of February 4, 2025, ICE held ≈42,000 migrants in custody—109% of its 38,521‑bed capacity (internal DHS data obtained by CBS News).  
• Over half of those detainees were initially arrested at the southern border.  
• On February 3, ICE released roughly 160 migrants, some fitted with ankle monitors under continued ICE supervision.  
• Under President Trump, ICE arrest operations have spiked to as many as 1,000 arrests on peak days, versus a 312‑per‑day average during Biden’s last year.  
• Customs and Border Protection, by contrast, held fewer than 2,000 migrants (≈9% of its 21,000‑bed capacity), reflecting a five‑year low in border crossings: January saw ≈30,000 illegal crossings (lowest since May 2020).

ICE Statements & Administration Plans (reliable, named sources)  
• ICE acknowledged its “enhanced” operations have driven “a significant number of arrests of criminal aliens that require greater detention capacity.”  
• The agency says it is “exploring every solution including…working with…CBP and our state and local law enforcement partners, asking Congress for increased funding, and scrutinizing case files to quickly remove criminal aliens with executable final orders of removal.”  
• NBC News corroborated that ICE has begun releasing some migrants arrested under the Trump administration.

Planned Detention Expansion (internal memos / officials)  
• ICE is eyeing 14 new sites (up to 1,000 beds each) and four larger facilities (10,000 beds each).  
• The Department of Defense has authorized use of a Space Force base in Colorado for ICE detention.  
• Guantánamo Bay Naval Base received its first group of migrant detainees after a Trump directive to convert the facility into an immigration center.  
• Officials familiar with the proposal say ICE is also considering “soft‑sided” tent facilities (originally built for short‑term Border Patrol processing), though operational and safety challenges remain.

Additional Reporting  
• Reuters reported that White House border czar Tom Homan asked county sheriffs to assist in ICE arrests and detentions.

# Historical Analysis of US Journalists Facing Criminal Charges: National Security, Source Confidentiality, and Legal Trends  

The prosecution of journalists in the United States has evolved significantly over the past two decades, with legal frameworks such as the Espionage Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), and Federal Wiretap Act increasingly weaponized against newsgathering activities. This report synthesizes historical cases, recent trends documented by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, and the broader implications for press freedom, particularly in national security reporting and source protection.  

---

## Historical Precedents: Espionage Act and Source Confidentiality Challenges  

### The Espionage Act as a Tool Against Journalism  
The Espionage Act of 1917 has been invoked in landmark cases targeting journalists and publishers. The prosecution of **Julian Assange**, founder of WikiLeaks, marked a turning point. Initiated under the Trump administration and continued under Biden, the case alleged that Assange’s publication of classified U.S. military documents violated §793(g) of the Espionage Act[1][9]. Legal experts and press freedom organizations warned that the government’s theory—criminalizing the solicitation, receipt, and publication of classified information—directly threatens conventional journalism[1][14]. Assange’s 2025 guilty plea, while not creating binding precedent, emboldens future administrations to test the law’s limits against mainstream outlets[1].  

Similarly, **Edward Snowden**’s 2013 charges under the Espionage Act for leaking NSA documents highlighted the law’s use against whistleblowers and those publishing classified material. Snowden faced three felony counts, including unauthorized communication of national defense information[12]. Congressional analyses noted the tension between national security claims and First Amendment protections, particularly when prosecutors bypass distinctions between leaking and journalistic publication[12].  

### Journalists Jailed for Protecting Sources  
The absence of a federal shield law has left journalists vulnerable to contempt charges for refusing to disclose sources. In 2005, **Judith Miller** of *The New York Times* spent 12 weeks in jail after declining to reveal her source in the Valerie Plame CIA leak investigation[10][16]. Similarly, freelance writer **Vanessa Leggett** served 168 days in 2001 for protecting sources in a Texas murder case[10][13]. These cases underscore the risks of relying on prosecutorial discretion rather than statutory protections.  

In 2023, **Catherine Herridge**, a veteran CBS journalist, faced contempt charges for refusing to identify sources in *Yanping Chen v. Federal Bureau of Investigation*, a Privacy Act lawsuit. Herridge argued that compelled disclosure would irreparably harm her credibility and chill national security reporting[4][8]. Fox News condemned the move, warning of a “chilling effect on journalism across the country”[8].  

---

## Legal Frameworks Enabling Criminalization of Newsgathering  

### Expansion of the CFAA and Wiretap Act  
The **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**, initially designed to combat hacking, has been reinterpreted to penalize journalists accessing publicly available information. The Biden Justice Department’s prosecution of **Tim Burke**, a Florida journalist, alleged that he “exceeded authorized access” by scraping live video streams and publishing unaired footage. Legal analysts warn that a conviction could criminalize standard digital newsgathering practices, such as using web scrapers or accessing unprotected data[1].  

Concurrently, the **Federal Wiretap Act** has been stretched to allege “interception” of public electronic communications. In Burke’s case, prosecutors argued that accessing live video feeds—even those streamed without encryption—constituted illegal interception under the 1968 statute[1]. This interpretation contradicts established precedent allowing journalists to record public events, such as police interactions[1][2].  

### State-Level Criminalization Tactics  
Local prosecutors have increasingly targeted journalists for covering protests or investigating public officials. In 2023, **Hank Sanders**, an Illinois reporter, received citations for “interfering with city employees” after repeatedly emailing a mayor for comment on flood responses[5]. Similarly, Arizona journalist **Camryn Sanchez** was served a restraining order by state Sen. Wendy Rogers for investigating her residency status[5]. These cases reflect a broader pattern of weaponizing minor charges to deter scrutiny.

## Recent Trends Documented by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker  

### Surge in Arrests and Assaults (2020–2025)  
The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker recorded **12 journalists arrested** and **44 assaulted** in 2023 alone, with most cases involving protest coverage[5][6]. During pro-Palestinian demonstrations in late 2023, three reporters faced charges of disorderly conduct, jaywalking, and trespassing[5]. Police raids, such as the 2023 search of the *Marion County Record* newsroom in Kansas, employed “Gestapo tactics” to seize equipment and files, according to the outlet[5][17].  

In 2024, **three journalists** covering Democratic National Committee protests in Chicago were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after nine hours in custody[18]. Such incidents align with a broader trend: over **30 reporters** were arrested at U.S. protests in 2024, per Tracker data[18].  

### Subpoenas and Prior Restraints  
Federal and state courts issued **30 subpoenas/legal orders** to journalists in 2023, often demanding source identities or unpublished materials[5][6]. The *Bakersfield Californian* was held in contempt for refusing to provide interview notes, while Alabama’s *Atmore News* faced felony charges for publishing a grand jury subpoena related to a school board investigation[5][17].  

Prior restraints—court orders blocking publication—rose to **11 incidents** in 2023, up from seven in 2019[5][16]. Most were quickly vacated, but their increased frequency signals judicial overreach into editorial decisions.  

---

## National Security Cases and Journalistic Ethics  

### The “New York Times Problem” and Its Legacy  
The Obama administration’s reluctance to prosecute Assange, termed the “New York Times problem,” acknowledged that Espionage Act theories could criminalize mainstream outlets[1][3]. This stance reversed under Trump, with Assange’s indictment creating a blueprint for future cases. Constitutional scholars argue that the Act’s broad language criminalizes not just leaks but the act of publishing itself, eroding the *Pentagon Papers* precedent[1][3][14].  

### Whistleblowers vs. “Insider Threat” Prosecutions  
The Biden administration continued Trump-era leak prosecutions, charging **eight individuals** from 2021 to 2025 under Espionage Act and bank secrecy laws[14][16]. While these targeted government employees, journalists face collateral risks. The 2024 indictment of a Substack journalist under Espionage Act provisions—for publishing emails about Trump-era deportation plans—signaled a direct threat to press freedom[9]. Acting Attorney General Mike Davis framed the case as analogous to prosecuting Julian Assange, blurring lines between journalism and espionage[9].  

---

## Impact Analysis: Chilling Effects and Legal Reforms  

### Erosion of Source Confidentiality  
Without federal shield laws, journalists in 49 states rely on patchwork protections, while national security reporters remain exposed. The **Herridge case** exemplifies how civil lawsuits can bypass media protections, forcing journalists to choose between jail and source betrayal[4][8]. Legal analysts warn that such precedents deter whistleblowers from coming forward, particularly in intelligence sectors[3][14].  

### Legislative and Judicial Responses  
Bills like the **PRESS Act**, introduced in 2023, aim to federalize reporter’s privilege but exclude national security contexts[4][10]. Meanwhile, courts increasingly defer to executive branch claims of “national security” to justify subpoenas, as seen in *Chen v. FBI*[4][8].  

---

## Conclusion: Press Freedom at a Crossroads  
The criminalization of journalism in the U.S. has escalated through novel legal theories, expanded statutes, and punitive prosecutions. While historical cases like *Branzburg v. Hayes* (1972) established narrow limits on reporter’s privilege, recent trends suggest a systemic erosion of First Amendment safeguards. Documented incidents from the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker reveal a 58% increase in journalist arrests from 2020 to 2023, with national security and protest coverage constituting high-risk categories[5][11][18].  

To mitigate these risks, policymakers must reconcile national security imperatives with constitutional protections, ensuring that laws like the Espionage Act are not weaponized against public interest journalism. Until then, journalists navigating this landscape will continue to face the specter of criminalization for routine newsgathering.

Analysis:
Given the historically rare but notable instances of journalists being charged in the U.S.—often linked to national security or refusal to reveal sources—there is particular interest in whether the recent political climate, especially statements from former President Trump regarding jailing journalists, could lead to more such incidents in 2025–2026. At this point, I want to collect current, April 2025 data on any reported arrests or criminal charges filed against journalists, as well as any recent legal or legislative developments that might signal a shift in the frequency of such charges. Ensuring coverage from both national and local sources will help in identifying any lesser-known cases or emerging trends, such as trespassing during newsgathering or charges under computer or wiretapping laws.

<Summary source="https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2025/03/letter-from-the-editor-ruling-in-nike-case-harmful-for-journalism-and-the-public.html">
The Oregonian’s editor Therese Bottomly warns that a recent 9th Circuit ruling in a lawsuit against Nike jeopardizes journalists’ First Amendment rights to intervene in court and unseal records. Key points:

1. Background on media intervention  
  • News outlets routinely ask courts to unseal records—e.g., sealed affidavits—so the public gets full context.  
  • In the Nike toxic‑culture case, The Oregonian/OregonLive joined the Portland Business Journal and Business Insider (represented by the Reporters Committee) to unseal internal “Starfish surveys” detailing employee complaints.  

2. Litigation timeline  
  • A federal magistrate judge ordered the documents unsealed.  
  • Nike appealed; District Judge Marco Hernandez remanded and Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo reaffirmed the press’s right to keep and report on improperly received but newsworthy materials.  
  • In February 2025, a three‑judge 9th Circuit panel reversed, declaring the media coalition a full “party” to the lawsuit—despite prior rulings—and did not address their First Amendment claims.  

3. Case specifics  
  • Reporter Matthew Kish was independently researching a former Nike employee (not a plaintiff) and briefly received similar sealed materials from plaintiffs’ lawyer Laura Salerno Owens, who has represented over 50 Nike employees. Owens said she sent them by mistake and later sought their return.  

4. Implications for journalism  
  • News organizations that intervene to protect the public’s right to know could be forced to return documents and barred from reporting on them.  
  • Independent reporters who never formally intervene might still publish such information, creating a disincentive for news outlets to join legal fights.  
  • Bottomly calls the ruling “a dark day for journalism in Oregon” and vows to continue challenging it to defend press freedom.

Summary:

On April 8, 2025, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) urged Zambian authorities to drop charges against Wave FM reporter Hope Chooma and to investigate those who attacked him and threatened Byta FM’s Robert Haloba. According to a police statement and Wave FM Zambia, on March 7 Chooma was covering a charity event in Mazabuka when supporters of the ruling United Party for National Development (UPND) assaulted him; police later arrested four suspects. On March 23, after one of those suspects filed a counter‑complaint, Chooma was arrested overnight on “assault occasioning actual bodily harm” charges—offenses carrying up to five years’ imprisonment—which he denies. CPJ Africa Program Coordinator Muthoki Mumo called the charges “an attempt to silence a journalist.” A medical report reviewed by CPJ documented a cut to Chooma’s neck and shoulder pain. Haloba told CPJ that assailants warned they could “do anything” to him because “they are the government.” Luckson Hamooya, president of the Mazabuka Press Club, said it was “strange” that a ruling‑party cadre claimed assault when in fact they were the aggressors. CPJ noted previous incidents of UPND supporters raiding newsrooms and reported that calls to UPND and government spokespeople went unanswered.

**Turkey: Students and Journalists on Trial for Istanbul Protests**
A trial began on Friday in Istanbul against nearly 200 people, including journalists and students, arrested during anti-government protests sparked by the detention of Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoğlu. The protesters are accused of participating in banned demonstrations and disobeying police orders to disperse. Imamoğlu, a key challenger to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's 22-year rule, was arrested on March 19 and jailed days later on corruption charges. His detention was widely seen as politically motivated and triggered nationwide protests. The government insists that Turkey's judiciary is independent and that courts operate freely. Derin Doga Kus, a student at Istanbul University, said, 'I spent 18 days in Silivri prison and was released a week ago. We all lost our exams. Some lost their jobs.' She added, 'This is not a legal process, it's a process where the law is trampled.' Avni Gundogan, father of another defendant, said, 'They exercised their constitutional and democratic rights. Their rights were violated. We demand an acquittal for our children.'

**Russia Sentences Four Journalists to Prison for Covering Navalny's Anti-Corruption Group**
A Moscow court sentenced four journalists, including two who worked for DW, to five and a half years in prison on charges of 'belonging to an extremist organization' for covering the activities of the anti-corruption group FBK founded by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. DW condemned the verdict and expressed solidarity with the imprisoned journalists and their families. The journalists, Antonina Vavilova, Konstantin Gatovsky, Sergei Karaylin, and Artem Krieger, were accused of being affiliated with FBK, despite their denial of the charges and insistence that they were simply doing their job as journalists. The case is notable because two of the defendants, Gatovsky and Karaylin, were part of DW's team in Moscow before the Russian authorities launched their campaign against foreign and domestic opposition media. During the closed-door trial, the journalists claimed that they were subjected to an unfair trial, with the authorities attempting to 'silence independent voices' by imprisoning them. The journalists have been subjected to harsh detention conditions since their arrest in the spring and summer of 2024, with Vavilova arrested in March, Gatovsky and Karaylin in April, and Krieger in June. In letters smuggled from inside Moscow's Matrosskaya Tishina prison, where they were transferred in October, Gatovsky and Karaylin described their dire situation, with overcrowding, sleeping on the floor, and a lack of basic human necessities. Gatovsky wrote, 'I feel like I'm living in a cellar with a small window that barely lets in any light. The cell is overcrowded, and I have to sleep on the floor next to another prisoner, with no comfort.' Karaylin described being placed in a cell with four beds for eight people, forcing them to sleep 'head to head' on a metal bed. His lawyer, Katerina Terentyeva, described the conditions as 'systematic torture,' saying that they deprived her client of a proper defense. 'I'm just an independent journalist,' said Artem Krieger before the verdict, describing the trial as 'pure madness,' and saying that the authorities are trying to portray him as a 'terrorist and a criminal who deserves to be in prison, just because he did his job as a journalist honestly.' DW's director-general, Peter Limbourg, condemned the verdict, calling it a 'new proof of Russia's disregard for the rule of law,' and saying that the Russian regime is doing everything it can to 'distort the truth' and treat brave journalists like 'dangerous criminals.' He added, 'Every day that Vavilova, Gatovsky, Karaylin, and Krieger spend behind bars is an extra day of unjust imprisonment.' Limbourg expressed DW's complete solidarity with the imprisoned journalists and their families. The case comes as freedom of the press in Russia continues to deteriorate, with Reporters Without Borders ranking Russia 162 out of 180 countries in its World Press Freedom Index, describing the situation as 'almost non-existent.' According to the organization's statistics, at least 37 journalists have been killed in Russia during President Vladimir Putin's rule due to their direct journalistic work. In the context of the ongoing campaign to tighten the noose on foreign media outlets, the Russian authorities banned DW's broadcasts and closed its Moscow office in February 2022, and blocked its website in all languages within the country. The Russian section of the channel has continued to operate from Riga, the capital of Latvia.

**Turkey Begins Mass Trial of Anti-Government Protesters**
Turkey has begun a mass trial of nearly 190 people, including journalists, students, and activists, who were arrested during anti-government protests. Eight journalists who were detained while covering the protests are among the defendants. One of the defense lawyers argued that the journalists were simply exercising their constitutional right to report. Outside the courthouse, a small group of family members and supporters of the detained students protested, holding signs and balloons. 'We release these balloons to symbolize the right to free expression, the right to education, and the right to live freely,' the group said in a statement. The Public Prosecutor's Office in Istanbul is prosecuting 819 people for their involvement in the protests, with sentences ranging from six months to five years. Hugh Williamson, the Europe director of Human Rights Watch, criticized the trials as 'a warning against the exercise of peaceful protest or freedom of expression' and urged prosecutors to drop charges without concrete evidence. Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent figure in the opposition and a potential presidential candidate in 2028, was arrested on March 19 and accused of leading a criminal organization, supervising a bribery and corruption scheme, and collaborating with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group considered terrorist by the Turkish government. Imamoglu denied the allegations, calling them 'unimaginable calumnies.' His arrest sparked the largest anti-government protests in Turkey in a decade, resulting in the detention of over 1,400 people.

**Sergey Karaylin's Sister Speaks Out About His Harsh Sentence and Conditions in Russian Prison**
Sergey Karaylin, a journalist for Associated Press, was arrested in April 2024 in Murmansk Oblast, Russia, along with three other journalists, Antonina Favorskaya, Artem Krigyer, and Konstantin Gabov. They were accused of participating in the activities of an 'extremist organization' (part 2 of article 282.1 of the Russian Criminal Code). The journalists denied the charges. A year later, they were sentenced to 5.5 years in a penal colony. Sergey's sister, Olga Karaylina, spoke with 'Bereg', a cooperative of independent journalists, about the events of the past year and how the inevitability of the harsh sentence has changed their family's life. Olga said that Sergey had the opportunity to leave Russia due to his Israeli citizenship, but he chose not to. She also mentioned that Sergey's wife and child did not want to leave Russia, and that Sergey was afraid of leaving them behind. Sergey's family was aware of the risks he was taking as a journalist, and they were worried about his safety. When Sergey was arrested, Olga was in shock and felt helpless. She said that Sergey was treated relatively well in the SIZO-5 'Vodnik' prison, but the conditions in the 'Matrosskaya Tishina' prison were harsh. The prison authorities censored Sergey's letters and did not allow him to receive certain food items. Olga has been trying to support Sergey by sending him food and vitamins, but it has been difficult due to the prison's restrictions. Sergey's health has suffered due to the harsh conditions in the prison, and he has developed dental problems. Olga is worried about Sergey's future and the possibility of him being transferred to a penal colony. She is trying to stay positive and support Sergey as much as possible.

**Venezuela: Journalist Gabriel González Detained for 10 Months, NGOs Demand Immediate Release**
The NGO Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón has demanded the immediate release of Gabriel González, a journalist who has been detained for 10 months in Venezuela. González was arrested arbitrarily on June 17, 2024, before the presidential elections in Venezuela. The organization stated, 'We reiterate our demand for immediate freedom. The arrest of Gabriel González constitutes a grave violation of his human rights and the free exercise of journalism.' The NGO also denounced a pattern of persecution against journalists in the country. According to the National College of Journalists (CNP), 13 journalists are currently detained in Venezuela, with at least 8 being arrested after the July 2024 elections. The organization urged respect for fundamental guarantees, due process, and an end to the criminalization of journalism. They also called for the urgent truth and justice for journalist Rory Daniel Branker, who has been missing since his arrest in late February. The CNP has described Venezuela as a 'hostile place' for journalists, citing 'arbitrary detentions, closures of media outlets, and systematic persecution' in recent years.

**Journalists Detained for Doing Their Job: 'We Were Forced to Prove Our Profession'**
Journalists who were detained and later released after covering protests in Saraçhane, Istanbul, spoke out after their first court hearing. They stated that the charges brought against them targeted their professional activities and that the indictment lacked any legal basis. The journalists emphasized that they were detained while on duty and were being tried for doing their job. Photojournalist Bülent Kılıç said, 'The indictment is really comical. It would be better if it were written for a primary school student. Our camera footage has been edited to only show us from the waist up, and our cameras, which are proof of our profession, are not visible.' Kılıç also mentioned that the prosecution had doubts about their journalist IDs and that they had to make a public call on social media to provide evidence. Hayri Tunç, another journalist, said, 'Today, it was not us who were on trial, but journalism. We were just doing our job, following the events. We were detained while covering the protests, and we were charged with 'misdemeanor of resisting the law' under the 2911 Law on Meetings and Demonstrations. However, we were there to do our job, not as protesters.' The journalists received great support during the trial and expressed their gratitude to their colleagues and international press organizations. They also called on the public to support them, stating that 'journalism is a public duty' and that 'the right to gather information is a constitutional right.'

**Journalist Alfousseini Togo's Arrest Condemned by Press Organizations**
The professional organizations of the press have condemned the arrest of journalist Alfousseini Togo, who was detained by the National Cybercrime Unit on April 9, 2025. The organizations, including the UNAJEP, Appel Mali, URTEL, and MPV-MALI, held a press conference at the Maison de la Presse on April 11, 2025, where they denounced the violation of the law and called for the journalist's release before his scheduled trial on June 12. The President of the Maison de la Presse, Bandiougou Danté, explained that the arrest was based on the revised code of criminal procedure, the press law, and the cybercrime law, but the organizations argue that these laws were not applicable in this case. The presidents of the organizations expressed their concern about the future of the profession and the danger of imprisoning journalists for acts related to their work. The attendees unanimously condemned the arrest, demanded the journalist's release, and called for unity within the profession. The President of the Maison de la Presse assured that the organization and the professional organizations of the media will take all necessary steps to secure the journalist's release before his trial.

**Two Journalists Detained in Suspicious Operation**
Two journalists, Timur Soykan and Murat Ağırel, who have been symbols of the fight against gangs and money laundering, were detained in a morning operation. They were accused of 'threatening and blackmailing' a person who was previously arrested for 'unlawful betting, money laundering, and forming a criminal organization.' The two journalists were called to give a statement at the prosecutor's office, but instead, they were detained. This has raised suspicions that the operation was a 'show of force' and an investigation into the source of the information they had obtained. Soykan and Ağırel have been investigating corruption and gangs for years, and their work has been crucial in exposing many scandals. They are known for their meticulous research and attention to detail. The two journalists are doing their job with integrity, and despite the risks, they continue to pursue the truth. Their recent work has focused on the case of Ekrem İmamoğlu's arrest and the use of secret witnesses. They have also highlighted the inconsistencies in the prosecutor's questions and the charges. The detention of the two journalists has raised concerns about the true motives and intentions behind the operation. As one commentator noted, 'the timing of the accusations is suspicious, especially given the fact that the two journalists had been investigating the case of Ekrem İmamoğlu.' The journalist's work is essential in exposing the truth and holding those in power accountable. As one of the journalists noted, 'we are not just investigating a simple case, but one that affects the entire society and economy.' The detention of the two journalists is a clear attempt to silence them and intimidate them into stopping their work. As one commentator noted, 'the current system is causing harm to the most vulnerable members of society, including workers and pensioners. It is essential that the business community also speaks out against this trend and recognizes the importance of a free and independent press.'

**Two prominent Turkish journalists detained over their work; newspaper cite it as false charges - The Times of India**
Two prominent Turkish journalists, Timur Soykan and Murat Agirel, were detained on Thursday on what their newspapers said were false charges stemming from their work. The journalists, who have been critical of the government and its recent actions, are accused of blackmail related to the sale of a TV channel. However, their supporters claim the real motive is to silence dissenting voices and suppress investigative journalism. Enes Ermaner, the lawyer for both men, said the detention was 'unlawful' and 'clearly shows that Enemy Criminal Law is being applied.' The prosecutor's office said the arrests were related to the sale of a television news channel called Flash Haber, but the journalists' newspapers assert that the main reason for the detention is their critical coverage of the government and recent protests. 'No matter what excuses the official authorities use, we know that the main reason for the detention of our friends is that they have revealed one by one the unlawful acts in all the judicial processes carried out since March 19 and have resolutely pursued the system of lies and plunder into which they are trying to drag the country,' BirGun said in a statement. The Contemporary Journalists' Association posted on X: 'Even if the news about the illegalities in the recent operations and the news they wrote against gangs and sects disturb some people, we will continue to say: Journalism is not a crime! Our colleagues must be released as soon as possible.'

**Seven Journalists Arrested and Charged with Terrorism in Ethiopia**
At least seven journalists have been arrested and charged with terrorism in Ethiopia after a news report about alleged rape by men in military uniforms. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the journalists were arrested in late March. The news report, which aired on EBS, claimed that men in military uniforms had kidnapped and raped a woman in 2020. However, the woman at the center of the case has since stated on state TV that the allegations were unfounded, and the founder of EBS has apologized for the report. The journalists and the woman are being held in pre-trial detention. According to court documents, the police claim that the journalists attempted to incite conflict and undermine the government in collaboration with extremist groups. Ethiopia is ranked 141 out of 180 countries on Reporters Without Borders' press freedom index for 2024, and the country has been regularly criticized for suppressing dissenting opinions.

**Azerbaijani Journalists on Trial for 'Smuggling News'**
Six employees of the Azerbaijani online media outlet Abzas Media, including director Uli Ghasanli, chief editor Sevinj Vagifgizi, journalists Narmina Abbasova, Hafiz Babayev, Elnara Gasimova, and translator Muhammad Kekalov, are on trial in Baku. They were arrested in November 2023 on charges of currency smuggling, and later in August 2024, they were charged with seven economic crimes under the Azerbaijani Criminal Code. The journalists claim they are being persecuted for their journalistic activities and exposing corruption among high-ranking officials. Narmina Abbasova said, 'I was arrested for preparing a report on the protests in the village of Suyudlu. The police blocked the village, but we brought the truth about what was happening there to light. If we are 'smugglers', then we are 'smugglers of news''. Hafiz Babayev compared the trial to Stalin-era show trials, saying, 'Today, after a staged investigation based on fabricated charges, the 'troika' has been presented.' Muhammad Kekalov, who was initially accused of being the deputy director, stated that he actually worked as a translator and gave his initial testimony under pressure. He denied the charges against him, saying he did not participate in communication between alleged donors and the management of the outlet. The trial began on December 17, 2024, and the journalists and their lawyers were allowed to attend the proceedings on December 28. However, in February, the defendants refused to participate in the hearings in protest against the inhumane treatment they received. The trial will continue on April 8.

**Azerbaijani Journalist Akif Qurbanov Writes Letter from Prison as Trial Looms**
Azerbaijani journalist Akif Qurbanov, who was arrested on charges of 'group incitement to hooliganism' in 2023, has written a letter from prison. The trial of Qurbanov and other journalists, including Ramil Babayev, Ruslan Izzetli, and Ilkin Amrahov, is set to begin on April 2. The journalists were initially charged under Article 206.3.2 of the Criminal Code, but new charges were brought under Articles 162-1.1, 192.3.2, 193-1.3.1, 193-1.3.2, 206.4, and 213.2.1. None of the journalists have accepted the charges. The trial is part of a wider crackdown on journalists and activists in Azerbaijan, with over 350 people currently imprisoned. The government claims that they are being held for 'crimes committed', but human rights groups say that they are being persecuted for their work. Meanwhile, a new case has been opened against Ali Kerimli's bodyguard, Kanan Basqal, who is accused of stabbing a man. Basqal has been held in pre-trial detention for four months. The case is part of a wider pattern of persecution of opposition activists in Azerbaijan. The country's human rights record has been criticized by international organizations, and the government has been accused of using 'group incitement to hooliganism' charges to silence critics. In other news, Azerbaijan is celebrating the Nowruz holiday, which marks the beginning of spring. The holiday is celebrated on March 20-21, and is a time for renewal and new beginnings. However, the celebrations have been marred by reports of police brutality and harassment of opposition activists. In a separate incident, two Azerbaijani soldiers were reported missing after a snowstorm in the country's mountains. The soldiers, Ruslan Həmidov and Əli İmanov, were on a training exercise when they were swept away by the storm. A search and rescue operation is underway, but so far, no bodies have been found. The incident is the latest in a series of accidents and incidents involving Azerbaijani soldiers. In another incident, a crane fell into the Caspian Sea during maintenance work at the 'Neft Daşları' oil platform. The incident resulted in the death of one worker, who was trapped inside the crane. The incident is the latest in a series of accidents and incidents involving Azerbaijani oil workers. In a separate development, journalist Ələsgər Məmmədli has been denied early release from prison. Məmmədli has been in prison since 2023, and has been accused of 'group incitement to hooliganism'. However, his lawyers say that there is no evidence to support the charges, and that he should be released. The case is part of a wider crackdown on journalists and activists in Azerbaijan.

**RFI Concerned About Detention of Chadian Correspondent Olivier Monodji**
RFI is concerned about the detention of its Chadian correspondent Olivier Monodji. The Chadian judiciary had originally scheduled Olivier Monodji's court appearance for last Thursday (March 13, 2025), but it has been postponed, and the new date is unknown. Olivier Monodji, along with two other journalists, is facing charges of undermining national security, punishable by 20 to 30 years in prison. RFI's leadership has expressed concern for Olivier Monodji's rights and has been in daily contact with his lawyers to follow the developments in his case. RFI's leadership has reaffirmed its commitment to respecting Olivier Monodji's rights and defense. The RFI Journalists' Association has stated that Olivier Monodji is being charged with 'collusion with foreign powers and undermining national security', a very serious offense. However, his lawyers have stated that the case files are empty and do not match the charges. The RFI Journalists' Association has updated its support for Olivier Monodji, calling on the Chadian authorities to respect the criminal procedure, defense rights, and the rights of journalists. The RFI Journalists' Association has also called on RFI's leadership to continue its efforts to assist this colleague. The SNJ-CGT union has expressed its concern for Olivier Monodji's situation and has strongly condemned the wave of arrests targeting journalists. Sadibou Marong, the Africa director of Reporters Without Borders, has expressed his concern, stating that they are worried about Olivier Monodji's situation. He believes that Olivier Monodji is a balanced journalist and that his publication, 'Le Pays', is also balanced. Reporters Without Borders hopes that Olivier Monodji will be released. The president of the Chadian Media Employers' Association has also expressed his concern about the future of press freedom in Chad. This interview was broadcast on March 15, 2025.

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis

1. **The Conversation (April 6, 2023)**: Focuses on journalists accused of espionage internationally, particularly Evan Gershkovich's detention in Russia. Provides factual data from the Committee to Protect Journalists on journalist killings and imprisonments worldwide. While academically credible, it doesn't directly address U.S. journalists facing criminal charges.

2. **ACLU Article (2014)**: Examines leak prosecutions under the Obama administration, noting a dramatic increase compared to previous administrations (526 months of prison time vs. 24 months total under all prior presidents). While from a reputable civil liberties organization, this source is significantly outdated for predicting 2025-2026 trends.

3. **WOLA Weekly Border Update (March 2025)**: Recent source detailing immigration enforcement changes in early 2025. Provides factual context about the current political climate but isn't directly relevant to journalist arrests.

4. **CBS News (February 5, 2025)**: Recent reporting on immigration enforcement and detention facilities. Provides factual information about current enforcement priorities but doesn't address journalist arrests.

5. **Perplexity Report (2025)**: Most directly relevant source, analyzing historical data on U.S. journalists facing criminal charges through early 2025. Includes specific cases and statistics from the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker (the resolution source). Notable factual information includes: 12 journalists arrested in 2023, over 30 reporters arrested at U.S. protests in 2024, and a 58% increase in journalist arrests from 2020-2023.

## Reference Class Analysis

Several possible reference classes emerge:

1. **U.S. Press Freedom Tracker data (2017-2025)**: Most directly relevant as this matches the resolution criteria. Shows an accelerating trend, with 12 arrests in 2023 increasing to over 30 in 2024.

2. **Prosecutions under specific laws affecting journalists**: The Perplexity report details cases under the Espionage Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and Federal Wiretap Act. While narrower than our question, this provides insight into more serious federal charges.

3. **Journalist arrests during protest coverage**: The data shows many arrests occur during protests (e.g., 3 journalists at DNC protests in 2024). This could be predictive if we anticipate significant protest activity during 2025-2026.

4. **Administration-specific enforcement patterns**: Different administrations show varying approaches to press freedom and prosecution, which could affect the outcome.

The most suitable reference class is the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker data, supplemented by contextual information about the current political climate and anticipated protest events.

## Timeframe Analysis

We're forecasting approximately 20 months: from April 20, 2025, through December 31, 2026. The historical data shows:
- A 58% increase in journalist arrests from 2020 to 2023
- A jump from 12 arrests in 2023 to over 30 in 2024
- This acceleration appears to coincide with increased political polarization and protest activity

The 2026 midterm elections will occur within our timeframe, potentially generating protest activity and related journalist arrests. The current administration (as of 2025) appears to be taking a harder enforcement stance generally, which could affect press interactions.

## Justification

Based on the reference class data and contextual factors:

1. **Baseline trend**: Taking the 30+ arrests in 2024 as a baseline and extrapolating over 20 months suggests approximately 50-60 cases through the end of 2026.

2. **Legal precedents**: Recent cases mentioned in the Perplexity report, such as Julian Assange's guilty plea in 2025, may "embolden future administrations to test the law's limits against mainstream outlets."

3. **Political factors**: The current administration (as of 2025) has demonstrated stricter enforcement in areas like immigration, which could extend to press interactions.

4. **Upcoming events**: The 2026 midterm elections and associated political activity may generate protests where journalists face arrest while reporting.

5. **Types of charges**: Most arrests involve relatively minor charges (disorderly conduct, trespassing) during protest coverage, rather than major federal charges, which means the threshold for inclusion is relatively low.

Considering these factors, a reasonable outside view would project between 40-80 journalists facing criminal charges during the remainder of 2025 and all of 2026, with significant uncertainty due to the potential for major protest movements or changes in enforcement priorities.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my distribution, I'll consider:

1. The historical trend shows significant acceleration (58% increase from 2020-2023, then more than doubling from 2023 to 2024).

2. The distribution is likely right-skewed, as there's more potential for extreme high values (if major national protests occur) than extreme low values (the minimum is 1).

3. Political factors create significant uncertainty, with potential for both intensification of current trends or moderation.

4. The 2026 midterms could generate substantial protest activity, potentially increasing the number of journalist arrests.

5. For my 90% confidence interval, I need a wide range to account for significant unknowns, including potential shifts in enforcement priorities or major social movements.

6. The median should reflect the current trajectory while the tails should accommodate reasonable extreme scenarios.

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:

1. **The Conversation article (April 6, 2023)** - This academic article provides historical context on how journalists have been charged with espionage, particularly in authoritarian regimes. While credible, it focuses primarily on international cases rather than U.S. prosecutions, making it tangentially relevant to our forecast.

2. **ACLU article (2014)** - Though dated, this source offers valuable historical perspective on the Obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers, noting 526 months of total prison time for national security leakers versus just 24 months under all previous presidents combined. This establishes a trend of increasing legal action against those who disclose classified information but focuses on leakers rather than journalists.

3. **WOLA Weekly Border Update (March 2025)** - A recent source focused on immigration enforcement with no direct relevance to journalist prosecutions. Not applicable to our forecast.

4. **CBS News article (February 5, 2025)** - Similar to the WOLA update, this recent article on ICE detention has minimal relevance to our question.

5. **Perplexity Report** - This comprehensive analysis directly addresses our question with data from the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker (our resolution source). It documents recent journalist arrests (12 in 2023, over 30 in 2024 during protests) and details legal frameworks increasingly used against journalists, including the Espionage Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and Federal Wiretap Act. The report identifies a 58% increase in journalist arrests from 2020-2023, making it highly relevant to our forecast.

## Reference Class Analysis:

Several potential reference classes emerge:

1. **Recent U.S. Press Freedom Tracker arrest data (2023-2025)** - Most directly relevant as it aligns with our resolution source, showing 12 journalists arrested in 2023 and over 30 in 2024 (protest-heavy election year).

2. **National security journalist prosecutions** - A narrower subset focusing on Espionage Act cases against journalists covering classified information.

3. **Source protection cases** - Instances where journalists face contempt charges for refusing to reveal sources.

The first reference class (recent Tracker data) is most suitable as it:
- Directly aligns with our resolution source
- Provides the most recent data
- Captures the full spectrum of journalist criminal charges

## Timeframe Analysis:

With today being April 20, 2025, we're forecasting approximately 20 months (remainder of 2025 plus all of 2026). Key temporal considerations:

- 2026 is a presidential election year, which historically correlates with increased protests and journalist arrests
- The observed increase (58%) in journalist arrests from 2020-2023 suggests an upward trend
- Not all arrests lead to criminal charges, suggesting a conversion rate we must estimate

## Additional Relevant Factors:

1. **Legal Framework Expansion** - The Perplexity report notes increasing use of the CFAA and Wiretap Act against standard journalistic practices like web scraping and accessing publicly available information.

2. **State-Level Prosecutions** - Local officials are increasingly bringing minor charges against journalists investigating public officials or covering protests.

3. **Political Climate** - The apparent reference to Trump-era policies suggests potential continuity in approaches to national security journalism and press freedom.

4. **Protest Coverage Risk** - A significant portion of journalist arrests occurs during protest coverage, with election years typically seeing more demonstrations.

## Justification:

Based on recent Press Freedom Tracker data (12 journalists arrested in 2023, 30+ in 2024), and considering that not all arrests result in criminal charges, we can establish a baseline of approximately 6-15 journalists facing charges annually. With 2026 being an election year, we should anticipate elevated numbers similar to 2024 rather than the lower 2023 figures.

For our 20-month forecast period, this suggests approximately 20-25 journalists will face criminal charges, with significant uncertainty. The upward trend in prosecutions, expansion of legal theories applied to journalism, and the election-year effect in 2026 all point toward numbers at least matching recent years, if not exceeding them.

# Outside view calibration:

To develop a probability distribution, I'll start with our baseline estimate (20-25 journalists) and adjust for uncertainty factors:

- Low end (10th percentile): If political tensions ease and fewer protests occur, we might see only ~10 journalists charged
- Middle range (40-60th percentile): Our baseline of 20-25 journalists represents the most likely outcome
- High end (90th percentile): If political tensions escalate significantly, major protests occur throughout 2026, and legal theories continue to expand, we could see 40+ journalists charged

The distribution should be right-skewed to account for the possibility of "black swan" events like mass arrests during significant civil unrest. I'll also incorporate wider uncertainty in the upper percentiles to reflect the potential for significant spikes in prosecutions during the election year.

Analysis:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(a) Source Analysis  
1) Conversation article (April 6, 2023) by Bill Kovarik  
   • Summary: Focuses largely on historical patterns of accusing journalists of espionage in Soviet‑bloc contexts, and the contemporary detention of Evan Gershkovich in Russia.  
   • Evaluation/Date: This is a reputable academic media outlet (The Conversation), but most facts and opinions concern non‑US scenarios (Russia, Central Europe). Hence, the direct relevance to forecasting US arrests or charges is limited. Factual data about US arrests is absent or only tangential.  

2) 2014 ACLU article on Leak Prosecutions under Obama  
   • Summary: Sets out how often the Espionage Act was used against alleged leakers, comparing them to prior presidencies (e.g., Manning, Drake, Kiriakou, etc.). Discusses the general chilling effect on journalists who receive leaked info.  
   • Evaluation/Date: ACLU is a credible advocacy organization. The article is nine years old, so it predates the Press Freedom Tracker’s standardization of data (launched in 2017) and does not speak directly to arrests or charges of journalists in the US, only of sources or whistleblowers.  

3) WOLA (Washington Office on Latin America) Weekly US–Mexico Border Update (February 2025)  
   • Summary: Immigration and enforcement statistics from early 2025, focusing on CBP and ICE data, border crossings, and deportations.  
   • Evaluation/Date: WOLA is a recognized NGO focusing on the Americas. However, these data have little direct relevance to US journalist arrests, as they relate primarily to migrants, deportation, and border enforcement, not press issues.  

4) CBS News (February 5, 2025) article on ICE releases amid overcapacity  
   • Summary: Includes ICE detention figures, capacity issues; details stepped‑up enforcement under the Trump administration.  
   • Evaluation/Date: CBS is a well‑known media outlet, and these data points are fairly reliable. However, like the WOLA update, this coverage concerns immigration enforcement, not arrests of journalists.  

5) Perplexity Report on historical data of US journalists facing charges  
   • Summary: Discusses a variety of cases where journalists were charged or threatened with charges, including usage of the Espionage Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or contempt of court for protecting sources. It references the US Press Freedom Tracker’s tally of arrests over recent years, especially around 2020–2023.  
   • Evaluation/Date: The aggregator cites multiple sources (RCFP, CPJ, VOA, etc.), many considered reputable. However, exact numbers for 2025 onward are necessarily speculative. Still, the references to protests in 2020–2023, or leak cases, give us a ballpark sense of how frequently journalists could be arrested or charged in the US.

(b) Reference Class Analysis  
Potential reference classes for forecasting the number of US journalists arrested/charged in 2025–2026:  
1) Recent Protest Coverage Arrests (e.g., 2020 and 2021)  
   • During major protests in 2020, over 100 journalist detentions or arrests occurred, but that exceptional surge reflected intense, widespread demonstrations (particularly anti–police violence and BLM events).  
2) “Typical” Non‑Protest Years (e.g., 2022, 2023)  
   • After 2020, fewer large‑scale protests yielded a lower incidence of arrests—some data indicate numbers dropped into a range of ~10–40 per year.  
3) Leak/Espionage/Criminal Charges in a National Security Context  
   • Far rarer than protest‑related arrests, though high‑profile cases (e.g., the “Marion County Record” newsroom raid, or contempt of court incidents) do happen.  

Most relevant reference class:  
• Since the question is broad—any criminal charge for conducting journalism—the major share historically has come from on‑the‑ground coverage of protests (with secondary reasons being refusal to reveal sources, or questionable applications of espionage laws). A “typical” or moderate protest environment from 2022–2023 seems more pertinent than the outlier year of 2020.

(c) Timeframe Analysis  
• We are forecasting for 2025 and 2026—roughly 20 months remain in 2025 plus all of 2026. Historical short‑term fluctuations can be large if national protests erupt or if controversies lead prosecutors to target journalists.  
• Data from the Press Freedom Tracker for 2021–2023 suggests a downward trend from the 2020 peak. For example, there were dozens of journalist arrests each year 2021–2023, but typically fewer than 2020’s triple‑digit figure.  

(d) Justification (Outside View)  
• Historically, US journalist arrests have varied from a few dozen in calmer years to over 100 in tumultuous protest periods.  
• Leak‑based or source‑protection indictments exist but remain scarce.  
• Given the current environment (as of April 2025), no major mass protests or crackdowns are reported. However, the political climate can shift quickly (e.g., election cycles, large demonstrations).  
• Thus, for 2025–2026 combined, the most likely count under current conditions might be in the low double digits or possibly under 20. We should, however, stay open to the possibility of either sporadic occurrences (small single digits) or a surge if prolonged protests eventuate.  

Outside view calibration:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• We aim for a realistic probability distribution that accounts for “normal” years (where arrests might be under 10) and the tail risk of large protests or targeted prosecutions.  
• Historically, mindful that even in “quiet” years, a handful of arrests for disorderly conduct, trespassing, or covering police activity is quite possible.  
• The Press Freedom Tracker enumerations from 2020 onward suggest that an absolute zero or near‑zero count is virtually impossible; at least a few arrests or charges happen each year.  
• We create broad percentile intervals to hedge against major unpredictabilities.

Forecaster_4 Step 1 Output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• “Reporting is not espionage” (The Conversation, Apr 6, 2023): Discusses historical (mostly overseas) cases of journalists accused of spying, including William Oatis, Leonard Kirschen, etc. The article focuses mainly on Russia/Soviet‑bloc allegations. Credible for historical context but less pertinent to domestic U.S. arrests.  
• ACLU “On Leak Prosecutions” (2014): Summarizes federal leak prosecutions in the Obama era, highlighting Espionage Act usage. Core data (number of months sentenced, number of individuals prosecuted) is factual; commentary on “chilling effect” is ACLU’s opinion.  
• WOLA border update (Feb 2025): Provides factual data on migrant arrests and border enforcement. Little direct mention of journalists, so minimal direct relevance for journos arrested in the U.S.  
• CBS News piece on ICE releases (Feb 2025): Factual reporting on migrant detention. No mention of journalists.  
• Perplexity report (undated, but references data up to 2024):  
   – Documents an uptick in U.S. journalists arrested, particularly at protests or on national security–-related grounds.  
   – Cites U.S. Press Freedom Tracker: 12 journalists arrested in 2023, “over 30” arrested in 2024.  
   – Discusses specific arrests at protests, subpoenas, and legal frameworks (Espionage Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act).  
   – Most of the factual data (counts of journalists arrested) likely sourced from the Press Freedom Tracker. Legal analysis or conclusions about “chilling effect” or “weaponization” are commentary.

In sum, the Perplexity report’s numeric data from the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker (12 arrests in 2023, 30+ in 2024) is the most relevant factual reference for forecasting 2025–2026 arrests/charges.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
• One reference class: prior annual counts of U.S. journalists arrested (2020–2024). We have partial numbers:  
   – 2023: 12 arrests.  
   – 2024: “over 30” arrests.  
• Another reference class: protests specifically. Many journalist arrests in recent years occurred when covering large demonstrations (e.g., 2020’s racial justice protests). The baseline thus varies with protest frequency.  
• A third reference class: Distinct national security/espionage charges. Historically, few actual criminal charges against journalists themselves. More typically, it’s government whistleblowers who are indicted.  

For this question, the most suitable reference class appears to be direct Press Freedom Tracker counts of arrests/charges for journalists in the U.S. That lumps together protest arrests (the most common in recent years) plus possible source‑protection or leak‑related charges.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• The time window is from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2026—about 1.75 years remaining from our vantage (April 20, 2025).  
• Historically, from 2020 onward, arrest counts per year have oscillated depending on major protest events or legal crackdowns. In calmer years, arrests can be <15; in more tumultuous times, they can exceed 30–40.

(d) Justification for outside view prediction  
• Historical data suggests the median annual number of journalists arrested or charged in the U.S. might range roughly from 10 up to 30, but it can surge higher with widespread protests.  
• Given a potentially more confrontational political climate, plus the possibility of large‑scale demonstrations ahead of the 2026 midterms or other events, we incorporate uncertainty that arrests could spike into the dozens each year.  
• However, it is rarer (though not impossible) for journalists to be criminally prosecuted under espionage or “leak” statutes. Most typical arrests are lower‑level charges (trespassing, disturbing the peace), often dismissed later.  

Outside view calibration:
• The two‑year combined total (2025–2026) is unlikely to drop below single digits, given the prior Press Freedom Tracker data.  
• Yet an extreme spike (e.g. >80) would probably require large national unrest or systematic crackdowns.  
• A reasonable baseline, using 2023–2024 data as anchors, might place the median or “most likely” range between 20 and 40 total arrests or charges over the full two‑year period.  
• We expand probabilities in the tails to account for possible spikes in protest activity or major changes in law enforcement approach.

Forecaster_5 Step 1 Output:
Analysis:
(a) Source Analysis  
• Conversation article (April 2023) by Bill Kovarik – The factual content concerns espionage accusations against journalists, mainly outside the U.S. (historical Soviet‑bloc arrests). The article offers less direct insight into arrests of journalists in the United States for their work. It does cite identifiable experts from the Committee to Protect Journalists and Society of Professional Journalists, but again, most of its detail involves foreign arrests rather than U.S. charges.  
• 2014 ACLU article on leaks under Obama (summarized) – The data are factual (e.g., the number of leak prosecutions and sentences), but relate more to whistleblowers and national‑security leak prosecutions than arrests of working journalists on U.S. soil. Still, these show expansions of legal mechanisms used to criminalize newsgathering or publishing.  
• WOLA Weekly U.S.–Mexico Border Update (February 2025) – This focuses overwhelmingly on CBP and ICE enforcement data, migrant flows, and detention capacity. No direct evidence that journalists were arrested or charged. It is a well‑known NGO source for border and migration developments but does not contain direct press freedom content.  
• CBS News article (February 2025) on ICE releases – Similar to the WOLA update, it details migrant detentions, capacity, and deportations. It does not directly address journalists facing charges.  
• Perplexity report – This is the key source summarizing historical data about journalists in the United States facing criminal charges (arrests while covering protests, potential misuse of the Espionage Act, subpoenas, etc.). It cites the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker’s documented arrests in 2023 and 2024 and references both recognized experts (Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press) and official data.  

In short, only the Perplexity report offers direct reference points on U.S.‑based journalist arrests or charges. Other sources are interesting context, but they contain fewer directly actionable facts for this forecast.  

(b) Reference Class Analysis  
• Possible reference classes include:  
  1) “Journalists arrested in the United States per year,” as tallied by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker in recent years.  
  2) “Number of national-security leak prosecutions,” which includes some journalists but mostly whistleblowers and leakers.  
  3) “Historic arrests of reporters covering high‑profile protests.”  

The second class (leak prosecutions) risks mixing those who leak information (often government employees) with journalists who simply publish. The third might omit arrests outside protests. The first—“annual incidents of journalists arrested while doing their jobs in the U.S.”—is likely the most relevant and best matches the question’s resolution criteria (the Press Freedom Tracker’s methodology).  

(c) Timeframe Analysis  
We are forecasting the total from 2025 through the end of 2026, i.e. about 20 months from now (April 2025) until December 31, 2026. Historically (from Perplexity data), annual arrests in the U.S. have varied: in 2023, around a dozen arrests; in 2024, around 30. Over two years, that can add to 20–40 if recent patterns hold. The question is how 2025–2026 will compare.  

(d) Justification for Outside View Prediction  
• The environment for press freedom in the U.S. has seen fluctuations: in protest‑heavy years, arrests increase. Some arrests have occurred for coverage of pipeline protests, racial justice demonstrations, or election‑related unrest.  
• The press freedom climate in the U.S. remains somewhat volatile; though no large new protest wave is confirmed for 2025–2026, continued tension between law enforcement and the press can yield new arrests.  
• The Press Freedom Tracker’s data (double‑digit arrests in a year, sometimes above 30) provides a plausible baseline range.  
• Because we lack direct signals of an imminent major crackdown or a major relaxation, continuing the recent average is our best “outside view” estimate.

Outside view calibration:
• We expect a distribution that reflects uncertainty. Very low values (e.g., under 5 total incidents over two full years) appear less likely, given typical annual tallies of at least 10–15 arrests. Very high levels (e.g., 80–100) are possible if massive unrest occurs but remain in the upper tail.  
• A reasonable midpoint might be in the 20–40 range, with tails accommodating lower or higher volatility.

## Source Analysis

1. **Press.org articles (January 27, 2025)**:
   - Content: Reports journalist arrests "surged" in 2024, exceeding combined totals of 2022-2023
   - Quality: National Press Club is credible on press freedom issues
   - Factual info: Arrests clustered in specific jurisdictions with aggressive protest policing
   - Recency: Very recent (3 months old)

2. **The Oregonian article (March 2025)**:
   - Content: 9th Circuit ruling potentially restricting journalists' rights to court intervention
   - Quality: Established newspaper, authored by editor (expert opinion)
   - Factual info: Court ruling creates new precedent affecting press legal standing
   - Recency: Recent (1-2 months old)

3. **Asknews query results**:
   - Notably lacking US-specific journalist arrest cases in early 2025
   - Most results cover international cases (Turkey, Russia, Venezuela)
   - This absence suggests possibly lower US arrest numbers in Q1 2025

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence**:
- The documented "surge" in 2024 arrests exceeding 2022-2023 combined indicates a clear acceleration trend with institutional momentum (Press.org)
- Historical pattern showing correlation between protest events and journalist arrests (Press.org)

**Moderate evidence**:
- 9th Circuit ruling creating less favorable legal environment for press freedoms (Oregonian)
- Concentration of arrests in jurisdictions with aggressive protest policing suggests structural factors

**Weak evidence**:
- Lack of prominent US journalist arrest cases in Q1 2025 news results (could be reporting bias)

## Timeframe Analysis

The forecast covers approximately 20 months (April 20, 2025 through December 31, 2026):
- Remaining ~8 months of 2025
- All 12 months of 2026

If the timeframe were halved (~10 months), I would expect ~50% fewer arrests, as we would miss the 2026 midterm election period entirely, which is likely to generate significant protest activity.

If doubled (~40 months), I would expect more than double (perhaps 2.5x) my prediction, as we would capture additional major political events (like campaign season for the 2028 presidential election).

## Justification

1. **Baseline trend extrapolation**: If 2024 experienced a "surge" exceeding 2022+2023 combined (conservatively estimated at 25-30 journalists over 12 months), a similar rate over 20 months would suggest approximately 40-50 journalists.

2. **Political event amplification**: The 2026 midterm elections will likely generate increased protest activity nationwide, creating more situations where journalists could face arrest while covering demonstrations.

3. **Legal environment deterioration**: The 9th Circuit ruling mentioned in the Oregonian represents a potential erosion of press protections that could embolden authorities to take more aggressive action against journalists.

4. **Jurisdictional concentration effect**: The Press.org report notes that arrests clustered in specific jurisdictions with aggressive policing approaches to demonstrations. If these policies spread or intensify, arrest numbers could increase.

5. **First quarter 2025 data point**: The relative absence of prominent US journalist arrest cases in early 2025 news suggests Q1 may have had fewer arrests than the 2024 average, potentially indicating some regression to the mean.

## Probability Calibration

For my distribution, I need to account for:

- **Base rate**: 2024 showed a significant increase over previous years
- **Right-skewed distribution**: Potential for extreme high values (widespread civil unrest, aggressive enforcement) is greater than for extreme low values (minimum outcome is 1)
- **Known events**: 2026 midterms virtually guarantee some protest activity
- **Timeframe**: 20 months provides ample opportunity for multiple protest cycles

The distribution reflects:
- Lower bound (10th percentile): 18 journalists - represents significant decrease from 2024 trend
- Median: 42 journalists - represents continuation of 2024 trend
- Upper bound (90th percentile): 90 journalists - represents acceleration of trend plus major protest movements

## Checklist:
1. Target: Number of US journalists criminally charged for work during April 2025-December 2026.
2. Outside view: 2024 saw surge exceeding previous two years combined; ~2+ arrests/month.
3. Consistency: Median=42, mean=~57; right-skewed due to greater upside risk potential.
4. Key evidence: 2024 acceleration trend, 2026 midterms, protest-arrest correlation, unfavorable court ruling.
5. Blind spot: Major federal press protection policy implementation would push numbers lower.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **National Press Club articles (January 2025)**: Reports a "surge" in US journalist arrests in 2024 that exceeded the combined total from 2022-2023. Source is reputable and relevant, citing data from Freedom of the Press Foundation's U.S. Press Freedom Tracker (our resolution source).

2. **The Oregonian editorial (March 2025)**: Details a concerning 9th Circuit ruling that could force journalists to return leaked documents and limit media interventions in court cases. Source is from a major newspaper's editor with direct stake in the issue; the factual elements about the court case appear reliable.

3. **AskNews articles (March-April 2025)**: Predominantly cover international journalist arrests (Turkey, Russia, Venezuela, etc.). No specific US journalist arrests in 2025 are mentioned, suggesting potentially low recent numbers. Sources include reputable outlets (Deutsche Welle, Times of India, RFI) but have limited direct US relevance.

4. **CPJ Report on Zambia (April 2025)**: While from a credible press freedom organization, this concerns Zambia and has minimal US applicability.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
- **2024 arrest surge data**: The National Press Club report indicating 2024 journalist arrests exceeded 2022+2023 combined establishes a critical recent baseline from our resolution source.
- **Press Freedom Tracker methodology**: The source has a functional definition of journalists that includes both traditional and non-traditional media workers performing acts of journalism.

### Moderate Evidence
- **9th Circuit Nike ruling**: Creates a new potential legal vulnerability for journalists who intervene in court cases, possibly increasing the risk profile.
- **Upcoming 2026 election cycle**: Historical patterns show that election years, particularly presidential elections, often correlate with increased protests and journalist arrests.

### Weak Evidence
- **Global press freedom deterioration**: While international cases show worsening conditions globally, they don't necessarily translate directly to US conditions.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction covers approximately 20 months (from April 2025 through December 2026).

If the timeframe were halved (10 months), I would expect roughly 40-50% fewer cases rather than exactly half, because the second half of our timeframe includes the 2026 election period, which likely poses higher risk for journalist arrests during protests.

If doubled (40 months), I would expect more than double the cases, as it would include the full 2028 election cycle, which historically presents elevated risks for press freedom incidents.

## (d) Justification

To establish a baseline, the "surge" in 2024 exceeding 2022+2023 combined suggests a significant uptick. If we conservatively estimate that 2022+2023 had 25-35 combined incidents (based on historical patterns), then 2024 likely saw 40+ incidents.

For 2025-2026, several factors will influence the outcome:

1. **Heightened legal risk**: The 9th Circuit ruling creates new legal vulnerabilities for journalists intervening in court cases.

2. **2026 Election cycle**: Presidential elections typically generate protests where journalists are at risk of arrest while covering events. The 2020 cycle saw over 100 journalist arrests during protests.

3. **Extended timeframe**: With 20 months remaining in our forecast period, we're covering most of 2025 and all of 2026.

4. **Current political climate**: While specific US arrests in early 2025 aren't mentioned in our sources, the National Press Club data indicates an upward trend in journalist legal jeopardy.

Given these factors, I expect the total for 2025-2026 to be moderately higher than just the 2024 number alone, with a right-skewed distribution to account for the possibility of major protest events.

## Probability Calibration

Based on the 2024 data point (40+ incidents) and the 20-month timeframe that includes the 2026 election, I expect:

- A minimum of several incidents even in the most press-friendly scenario
- A median in the 50-60 range (somewhat higher than a single year's 2024 total)
- A right-skewed distribution with significant potential for higher numbers if major protests occur
- A remote possibility of numbers exceeding 150+ if widespread civil unrest similar to 2020 occurs

## Checklist:
1. Target: Number of US journalists criminally charged for their work in 2025-2026 per Press Freedom Tracker
2. Outside view: 2024 saw 40+ journalist arrests (exceeding 2022+2023 combined)
3. Implied median ~57; mean ~65 due to right skew; aligns with justification
4. Key evidence: 2024 surge data; 9th Circuit ruling increasing legal vulnerability; 2026 election protest risk
5. Blind spot: Widespread sustained civil unrest could push numbers well above 90th percentile

Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis  
Below are the primary pieces of information consulted, focusing on their relevance to U.S. journalists arrested or charged in 2025–2026:

1) National Press Club Article (Jan 27, 2025)  
   • Summary: States that in 2024, journalist arrests in the U.S. “surged,” exceeding the combined totals for 2022 and 2023.  
   • Date & Quality: Recent, from a reputable press organization. Factual claims anchored in U.S. Press Freedom Tracker data. Credible as an overview, though it lacks precise numerical counts.

2) Oregonian Opinion (Mar 2025)  
   • Summary: Criticizes a 9th Circuit ruling limiting unsealing of records, warning of negative implications for press freedom.  
   • Date & Quality: Reputable local media source providing an informed editorial. This is expert-opinion regarding free-press legal trends, but not direct data on arrest statistics.

3) Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) Africa-related content (Apr 2025)  
   • Summary: CPJ calling on Zambian authorities to drop criminal charges against a journalist.  
   • Date & Quality: CPJ is authoritative on press-freedom issues, but these incidents are outside the U.S. Not directly relevant for our numerical forecast on U.S. arrests.

4) “Asknews” Articles (various, 2025)  
   • Summary: A compilation covering arrests, charges, or convictions of journalists globally (Turkey, Russia, Ethiopia, etc.).  
   • Date & Quality: Timely and from multiple international news sources. However, these primarily discuss foreign contexts. Only tangentially relevant to U.S. statistics since they reveal a broader global pattern of press harassment. Still, none references current U.S. arrests specifically.

Conclusion on Sources:  
• Strongest U.S.-specific factual content is the National Press Club article referencing the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.  
• The rest mostly describes non-U.S. incidents or offers editorial perspective. Their direct numerical relevance to U.S. arrests in 2025–2026 is limited.

(b) Evidence Analysis  
• Strong Evidence:  
  – The National Press Club piece citing the Press Freedom Tracker for a “surge” in 2024 arrests. Consistent with known press-freedom monitoring.  
  – Historical patterns in the U.S. that pinpoint spikes in journalist arrests during periods of heightened protest/political tension.

• Moderate Evidence:  
  – Editorial/legal commentary on press freedom crackdowns (Oregonian editorial). Indicates institutional challenges but does not quantify arrests.

• Weak Evidence:  
  – Non-U.S. arrests from “Asknews.” Shows a global pattern of clampdowns but directly extrapolating to the U.S. is speculative.

(c) Timeframe Analysis  
• Forecast Window: Entirety of 2025 and 2026 (about 20 months from now, April 20, 2025).  
• If the horizon were halved (only mid-2025 to mid-2026), the arrest count might be somewhat lower, as part of the forecast includes midterm-year protests in late 2026.  
• Doubling the horizon (through 2027–2028) could see major political shifts increasing or decreasing arrests. For now, we limit ourselves to the actual 2025–2026 resolution window.

(d) Justification  
Outside-View Base Rate:  
• The Press Freedom Tracker recorded relatively modest U.S. journalist arrests in mid-2010s. Then 2020 saw a large spike (mostly protest coverage). In subsequent years, 2022–2023 tallied lower but still non-negligible arrests. By 2024, arrests surged again, outpacing the prior two-year total.  
• Extrapolation suggests that 2025–2026 combined could match or modestly exceed recent multi-year totals—particularly if 2026 yields significant protest activity.  
• Therefore, a plausible baseline might be in the range of 20–40 journalists arrested and charged over 2025–2026. But to capture tails, we widen the range considerably, acknowledging uncertainty—some years have had as few as 10–15 arrests, while surge years can see 50+.

Probability calibration

• Given the upward trend in 2024, plus ongoing protest patterns, I center the median around 30–35.  
• A relatively calm 2025 would bring it down toward ~20, whereas a tumultuous 2026 could raise the total near 50 or more.  
• My distribution below leans right-skewed to allow for a surge scenario.

Checklist:
1) Target variable <20 words: “Total U.S. journalists arrested/charged in 2025–26, per U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.”  
2) Outside view base rate: ~20–40 based on historical Tracker data and known protest-driven surges.  
3) Consistency check:  
   • Implied median ≈ 35; mean in the high 30s. This aligns with the justification that 2024’s surge might continue.  
4) Top Evidence:  
   (1) Surge of 2024 arrests, surpassing 2022+2023 combined.  
   (2) Historical protest-driven arrest spikes.  
   (3) Press Freedom Tracker’s documented multi-year upward trend.  
   (4) Midterm year 2026 can increase protest coverage risk.  
5) Blind-spot scenario:  
   • If 2026 remains unexpectedly calm, overall arrests might be much lower (under 15). Alternatively, a new wave of civil unrest could double or triple typical counts.

Analysis:
(a) Source Analysis

• National Press Club (NPC) article (Jan 27, 2025) – Mentions “surge” of U.S. journalist arrests in 2024, exceeding previous two years combined.  
  – Date/Quality: Recently published, quoting Freedom of the Press Foundation’s U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. Reliable factual base: it cites data from a well‑known tracker. Opinion from Kirstin McCudden about “threat” to First Amendment is an informed viewpoint.  
• Oregonian editorial (Mar 2025) – Focuses on First Amendment implications of an unsealing court case.  
  – Date/Quality: Reputable local outlet. However, it lacks direct data on U.S. journalist arrests. Mostly commentary on press freedoms, so limited direct quantitative usage.  
• CPJ article on Zambia (Apr 2025) – Unrelated to U.S. arrests.  
• Asknews article set – Largely covers arrests/detentions of journalists in Russia, Turkey, Ethiopia, etc.  
  – Many revolve around large protest crackdowns or state hostility to press, but all outside the U.S. No direct numeric input on U.S. arrests.  
• Perplexity reference (cited in the instructions) – Summarizes U.S. Press Freedom Tracker data indicating about 12 arrests in 2023, “over 30” in 2024.  
  – Date/Quality: Not shown in detail here, but presumably from a recognized aggregator (Press Freedom Tracker). Likely the best numeric reference for 2023–24.  

Overall, the best factual anchor for U.S. arrests is the Press Freedom Tracker data as cited by the NPC and the Perplexity summary. Everything else is mainly tangential or focuses overseas.

(b) Evidence Analysis

• Strong Evidence:  
  – “Over 30” U.S. journalist arrests in 2024 (NPC citing Press Freedom Tracker, confirmed by multiple references). This implies arrests in 2024 exceeded the total of the two previous years.  
  – Historical pattern (2020–2024) that protest coverage often correlates with journalist arrests. The Press Freedom Tracker is well known for systematically counting these incidents.  
• Moderate Evidence:  
  – Commentary that the 2024 surge was protest-driven, suggesting future spikes could hinge on large-scale demonstrations.  
• Weak Evidence:  
  – Opinion pieces (Oregonian editorial). Less direct bearing on the numeric count of arrests.  
  – Foreign country examples of journalist arrests (Turkey, Russia, Ethiopia) are not directly applicable to the U.S.  

(c) Timeframe Analysis

• Prediction covers 2025–2026, i.e. from now (~Apr 2025) to Dec 31, 2026 (about 20 months).  
• If we halved the timeframe to just 2025, the forecast range might drop ~50%. If doubled to four years, we could see a more substantial total. Because arrests often spike unpredictably (e.g. major protests), the longer the horizon, the higher the total.

(d) Justification

Outside View Base Rate:  
• 2023: ~12 arrests.  
• 2024: “Over 30” arrests. If 2024 ended around 35 arrests, that’s nearly triple 2023. Historically, protest surges can quickly increase arrests.

Inside View Adjustments:  
• Potential for 2025–2026 to replicate or moderately exceed 2024, especially if large demonstrations occur.  
• No guarantee 2025–26 will see the same protest intensity.  
• Likely that at least ~20–25 total arrests will happen over two years, given the prior trend; upper tail could exceed 70+ if widespread unrest or crackdown occurs.  
• Weighted reasoning yields a central range near 30–60, with a midpoint ~40–45.

Probability calibration
I form a wide distribution to encompass the possibility of calm periods (fewer than 20 arrests) vs. heightened civil unrest (70+). My best guess for a two‑year total is in the 30–50 corridor. Below is a more fine‑grained set of percentiles.

Checklist:
1) Target variable in <20 words: “Number of U.S. journalists arrested/charged in 2025–2026 per U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.”  
2) Outside view base rate: historically 12 in 2023, ~35 in 2024 → ~47 total across 2023–2024.  
3) Consistency check: Implied median ~45; mean likely near 50–55. It appears consistent with the justification.  
4) Main evidence factors:  
   • 2024 “surge” (strong)  
   • Press Freedom Tracker data (strong)  
   • Protest coverage link (moderate)  
   • 2023 base of 12 arrests was overshadowed by 2024 (surge)  
5) Blind spot scenario: Large national protests drive total well above 80. That would push the outcome upward.

Output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• National Press Club (NPC) pieces (Jan. 27, 2025) – Summaries indicate that 2024 arrests of U.S. journalists surged, exceeding the combined totals of 2022 and 2023. Exact figures not provided. These accounts come from the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, typically considered reliable. Opinions were voiced about law enforcement’s potentially chilling effect on press coverage.  
• Oregonian article (March 2025) – Warns of mounting judicial restrictions on journalists’ First Amendment rights (e.g., disincentives to unseal court documents). Source is The Oregonian’s editor, an informed stakeholder but not providing direct arrest figures.  
• CPJ, overseas developments (Zambia, Turkey, Russia, etc.) – These references center on charges/arrests of journalists abroad, thus less relevant to the specific U.S. question. Nonetheless, they confirm the trend that journalists worldwide face legal challenges.  
• No direct new data on arrests or charges of journalists inside the U.S. so far in 2025 is detailed. However, the hints of “surge” continuing from 2024 can matter.  
• Reliability: The Freedom of the Press Foundation (via the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker) is typically strong. The NPC cites that tracker’s data. Editorials reflect reasoned expert opinions but are not direct numeric data.

(b) Evidence analysis  
• Strong evidence:  
  – U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is a direct data source for the question’s resolution. Its multi-year tallies show recurring arrests, often during protests or civil disruptions.  
  – Historically, arrests have tended to spike in periods of heightened protest or unrest. The 2024 surge suggests a structural factor: protest coverage often leads to direct confrontation with law enforcement.  
• Moderate evidence:  
  – Opinion-based warnings from editors and press-freedom groups that arrests of U.S. journalists might remain elevated if policing practices do not change.  
• Weak evidence:  
  – Overseas arrests (Russia, Turkey, Zambia) do not directly predict U.S. arrests, though they illustrate a worldwide climate of heightened legal threats to journalists.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• The question covers arrests/charges of journalists in the U.S. from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2026 (two full calendar years). Currently, it’s April 20, 2025, so ~20 months remain.  
• If the timeframe were halved (only to December 2025), the historical annual rates suggest we might see about half of the eventual total. If doubled (four years), structural changes in U.S. policing or legislation might produce higher or more uncertain totals.

(d) Justification  
• Outside view base rates indicate the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has documented double-digit annual arrests in recent years. In 2024, arrests “surged” above 2022–2023 combined. A plausible average annual baseline might be around 15–25 arrests historically, with spikes to 30+ in heightened protest years. Over two years, that can aggregate into a wide range (20 to 60+).  
• 2024’s higher total suggests the chance of continuation into 2025–2026, given ongoing protest potential and tense policing environment.  
• We therefore center around a mid- to high-20s annual average for 2025–2026, with uncertain protest cycles possibly pushing totals into the 40s or more.  

Probability calibration
• Outside view anchor: ~15–25 arrests per year historically. Over two years, 30–50 is plausible as a baseline.  
• Inside view factors: The 2024 surge implies this might remain elevated, so a center near ~35–40 is justified, but with a wide tail for large-scale protests or an abatement if policing changes.  

Checklist:
1. Target variable in <20 words: “Number of journalists charged or arrested in the U.S. for their work in 2025–26 (per Press Freedom Tracker).”  
2. Outside view base rate: ~30–50 total over two years, historically.  
3. Consistency check: “Implied median ≈ 35; mean ≈ ~38; consistent with prior surges and uncertain protest environment.”  
4. Biggest evidence factors: (1) 2024 surge outstripping 2022–23 combined. (2) Press Freedom Tracker’s documented multi-year pattern. (3) Ongoing friction between law enforcement and journalists covering protests. (4) Regular spiking around elections or civil unrest.  
5. Blind-spot scenario: Sudden major wave of large-scale protests in 2025–26 (or a major crackdown) could yield very high numbers, making our central estimate too low.
