Analysis:
This question hinges on the historical frequency and context of direct phone calls between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin—both during Trump’s presidency and afterward—as well as any calls since Trump left office. Establishing a baseline (“out-view”) involves cataloging known Trump–Putin calls, their timing relative to major events, and any precedent for ex-presidents maintaining direct lines to foreign leaders. We also need to surface news on the February 2025 call (per Wikipedia), plus any reporting on talks or planned calls since then, to inform an “inside view” adjustment.

Analysis:
The core issue is whether the Trump campaign or post-presidential political apparatus and the Kremlin will arrange a bilateral call in the five-week window from May 12 to June 15, 2025. Key factors:
• Time left: One week until the window opens, then just over a month. Any signals now are likely final.
• Status quo: No routine Trump–Putin calls have occurred since Trump left office, unlike sitting presidents.
• Catalysts for a call:
  – Trump campaign foreign-policy rollout (e.g., meetings with advisors like Pompeo, Bolton) signaling outreach.
  – Kremlin’s interest: Russia’s domestic political calendar (post–March 2025 election) and need for legitimacy.
  – External crises (Ukraine, Middle East) creating impetus for direct communications.
• Sub-factors for a “Yes” outcome:
  – Public/unpublished overtures by Trump or his team requesting contact.
  – Kremlin acknowledgments (e.g., Peskov confirming call plans).
  – Media leaks from US or Russian diplomatic channels.
• Sub-factors for a “No” outcome:
  – Trump focuses on domestic campaign free of foreign entanglements.
  – Kremlin avoids optics of dealing with a non-officeholder.
  – US establishment pushback on unauthorized outreach.
• Experts’ expectations: So far no major reporting of efforts underway; experts view a call as low probability absent a crisis.
To get a better inside view, I need the latest statements from Trump or his advisors about contacting Putin, any Kremlin press-office remarks on readiness for a call, and analysis of campaign/diplomatic signals in the run-up to our window.

<Summary source="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-putin-talked-many-7-2021-new-book-claims-rcna174528">
Below is a summary of the NBC News article “Trump and Putin have talked as many as 7 times since 2021, new book claims” (Oct. 8, 2024). Reliable sources are named; anonymous or less-verifiable claims are so noted.

1. Reported phone calls  
   – According to journalist Bob Woodward’s new book, former President Trump and President Putin have spoken by phone “maybe as many as seven” times since Trump left office in 2021.  
   – Woodward recounts one instance this year at Mar-a-Lago when Trump told a senior aide to leave his private office so he could have “a private phone call” with Putin.  
   – Source: a single anonymous aide who “loitered in a hallway” during that call (less-reliable, unnamed).

2. Campaign response  
   – Trump’s campaign did not confirm or deny the calls when asked by NBC News.  
   – Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director, emailed NBC to call Woodward’s book “made-up stories.”  
   – Trump told ABC News the Putin-call report was “false” and that Woodward had “lost his marbles.”  

3. Comments from Trump allies  
   – Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Trump’s running mate, said he was surprised Woodward is still alive, labeled him a “hack,” and argued that “there’s nothing wrong with engaging in diplomacy” even if the calls occurred.  

4. Historical context in Woodward’s book  
   – Woodward also describes a White House episode in early 2020 when Trump sent COVID-19 testing equipment to Russia.  
   – Woodward quotes senior adviser Jason Miller in July (2024) saying he was “not aware” of any Trump–Putin talks but that “they’d know how to get in touch with each other” if needed. Miller added that any formal peace-negotiation call wouldn’t happen until after a Trump election victory.  

5. Broader implications  
   – The book raises questions about how a second Trump term might affect U.S. policy on the war in Ukraine and whether Trump, as a private citizen, had authority to engage Putin without White House approval.  
   – Trump has publicly called his relationship with Putin “very good” and said he could broker a “deal… good for both sides.”  
   – On “The Howard Stern Show,” Vice President Harris criticized Trump for “secretly helping out an adversary” by sending COVID tests to Russia.  
   – In an interview with Ben Shapiro, Trump defended his rapport with Putin as “a great thing.”  

Note: NBC News obtained a copy of Woodward’s book but neither Trump nor Putin has publicly confirmed the reported calls beyond the anonymous aide’s account.

<Summary source="https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-trump-may-have-spoken-more-than-twice-kremlin-says-2025-03-23/">
Here’s a concise extraction of the key points from the Reuters article “Putin and Trump may have spoken more than twice, Kremlin says” (March 23, 2025):

1. Objective facts and measurements  
   • Two publicly announced phone calls between Putin and Trump in 2025: February 12 and March 18.  
   • Reports (Reuters, The Washington Post, Axios) of an additional early-November call; Kremlin denies these reports.  
   • Bob Woodward’s 2024 book War claims up to seven direct conversations between Trump and Putin after January 2021; the Kremlin denies Woodward’s account.

2. Opinions and statements from named, generally reliable sources  
   • Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov:  
     – “We inform you about the conversations that we are aware of. But we can’t rule out everything else.”  
     – On whether Ukraine’s continued strikes on Russian energy infrastructure could prompt another call: “Absolutely. The presidents confirmed their intention to continue contacts as necessary.”  
     – Describing the latest call as “a step towards a face-to-face meeting.”  
   • Donald Trump:  
     – To the Washington Examiner: he “had been speaking to the Russian leader for weeks.”  
     – To Bloomberg (on Woodward’s claim of seven calls): “If I did, it’s a smart thing.”  
   • European leaders (unnamed): reportedly “spooked” by the possibility that the U.S. might prioritize a broad “grand bargain” with Russia—covering oil prices, the Middle East and China competition—over European security.

3. Potentially useful views from less-reliable or unnamed sources  
   • State television correspondent Pavel Zarubin (via a Kremlin video clip) asked about “all sorts of nuances” in unreported contacts—Peskov’s equivocal reply suggested more calls “are possible.”  
   • Kyiv’s government (unnamed officials) says it’s open to a partial ceasefire if Russia agrees to written terms; accuses Moscow of violating Putin’s own suspension of attacks, which Russia denies.

4. Other relevant context  
   • Trump casts himself as a peacemaker keen to end the Ukraine war and avert a wider U.S.–Russia conflict.  
   • In their most recent exchange, Putin agreed to suspend strikes on Russian energy facilities; Kyiv denies compliance, Russia warns of “symmetrical response.”  
   • Russia-U.S. talks scheduled in Riyadh are also framed by Peskov as steps toward a possible face-to-face meeting between the presidents.

No further calls have been officially confirmed beyond Feb. 12 and Mar. 18, 2025, but both Kremlin sources and Trump himself suggest additional contacts cannot be ruled out.

Russia Matters (Russiamatters) – Summary of the March 18, 2025 Trump–Putin Call

Disclaimer: summary is based solely on the provided Russia Matters article.

1. Call Overview  
  • Date and duration: March 18, 2025; two‐and-a-half hours.  
  • Main U.S. objective: secure a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine.  
  • Putin’s concession: agreed only to “suspend strikes on energy infrastructure” for 30 days; did not agree to a full ceasefire.

2. Divergent Readouts  
  – Length and detail: Kremlin’s readout is more than twice as long as the White House’s.  
  – Agreed terms  
    • White House: “movement to peace will begin with a 30-day energy and infrastructure ceasefire” and technical negotiations on Black Sea navigation safety.  
    • Kremlin: “mutually refrain from strikes on energy infrastructure for 30 days” and further talks on a “well-known proposal” for Black Sea navigation safety.  
  – Kremlin‐only items  
    • Discussion of “complete cessation of providing Kyiv with foreign military aid.”  
    • Praise of Trump for “striving to achieve the noble goal of ending the hostilities.”  
    • Formation of U.S.-Russian expert task forces to work on a Ukrainian settlement.  
    • Detailed Russian conditions for ceasefire: control mechanisms, halting forced mobilization in Ukraine, stopping re-arming of Ukrainian forces, and citing alleged “barbaric acts of terrorism” by Ukrainian militants in Russia’s Kursk Region.  
  – White House omissions: no mention of foreign-aid halt, expert task forces, or Putin’s list of ceasefire conditions.

3. Interpretations and Implications  
  • Kremlin’s verbosity and added content signal Putin’s desire to portray the bilateral relationship as normalizing now that the U.S. “no longer treats him as a pariah.”  
  • Underlying strategic gap: Trump pressed for a full ceasefire as a first step toward a broader peace deal; Putin insists on security guarantees (Ukraine’s demilitarization/neutrality, a rollback or freeze of NATO deployments, lifting of Western sanctions) before halting all hostilities.  
  • Achieving any comprehensive agreement will require not only U.S. and Ukrainian buy-in but also consent from the EU and U.K., each with its own conditions for peace.

4. Key Quotes (Kremlin Readout)  
  • On energy ceasefire: “Donald Trump put forward a proposal for the parties to mutually refrain from strikes on energy infrastructure for 30 days. Vladimir Putin responded favorably… and immediately gave the relevant order to the Russian troops.”  
  • On peace‐settlement negotiations: “Confirming his fundamental commitment to finding a peaceful resolution… the President of Russia expressed willingness to thoroughly work out possible solutions in cooperation with the American partners… take into account… Russia’s legitimate security interests.”

<Summary source="https://abcnews.go.com/International/trump-putin-call-means-ukraine-analysis/story?id=118788646">
Here is a summary of the ABC News analysis “What the Trump-Putin call means for Ukraine” (no injection of outside knowledge):

• Context and impact  
  – On Wednesday, President Donald Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin—the first direct U.S. presidential call with Putin in three years.  
  – Trump’s outreach effectively ends Putin’s pariah status in U.S. diplomacy and signals a U.S. willingness to “welcome him back,” a move celebrated in Moscow.  
  – Putin’s long-standing goal has been to negotiate directly with Washington “over the head” of Kyiv; the call risks realizing that objective.

• Ukrainian reactions  
  – A former senior Ukrainian official (anonymous) told ABC News they were baffled that Trump publicly conceded on two major items—NATO membership and territorial integrity—“without any negotiations,” characterizing it as “two gifts straight on the table.”  
  – The source warned that Trump appears to value U.S.–Russia rapport over Ukraine’s interests and fears any patched-up peace “is not going to hold for like 10 minutes.”

• Russian signals  
  – Tatiana Stanovaya (founder, R. Politik; senior fellow, Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center) wrote on X that Putin “is fully prepared for these talks to fail,” will “flatter and appease Trump” with cosmetic concessions (e.g. a ceasefire) that mask Russia’s ultimate aim: a disarmed, subordinated Ukraine.

• Trump-Zelensky exchange  
  – Trump later spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who warned against sidelining Ukraine and insisted no deal with Russia be made before direct U.S.–Ukraine consultations.  
  – Zelenskyy: “We…will not be able to accept any agreements without us…meetings are our priority. Ukraine, America, and only after those meetings…then Russians.”

• European reactions  
  – German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius called it “regrettable” the U.S. “made public concessions to Putin before negotiations have even begun.”  
  – Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur agreed: “We must not hand Russia any advantage before negotiations even begin.”

• U.S. defense position remains steady  
  – U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, at a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders and NATO membership are “unrealistic objectives” and that pursuing them “will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.”  
  – He reiterated that continued weapons and support post-ceasefire—and ultimately Ukraine’s own strong military—constitute its best security guarantees. Trump added he would keep aiding Ukraine “to stop Putin from saying he won.”

• Zelensky’s “Plan B” and security proposals  
  – Zelenskyy outlined “Plan B” should NATO membership be blocked: “build NATO” on Ukrainian soil via a heavily armed Ukrainian military plus European peacekeepers.  
  – Hegseth floated the idea of European/non-European troops policing a demilitarized zone—requiring a force (Zelenskyy estimated ~100,000 troops) likely beyond European capacity and potentially unacceptable to Putin.

• Next steps and stakes  
  – At the upcoming Munich Security Conference, Vice President J.D. Vance will meet Zelenskyy; Ukraine aims to cement its minimum demands.  
  – Overall, ABC News concludes the Trump-Putin call marks a major diplomatic victory for Putin and brings the U.S. significantly closer to Russia’s position on the Ukraine war.

<Summary source="https://theconversation.com/what-we-learned-from-trump-and-putins-phone-call-editors-briefing-249902">
Here’s a concise summary of the Conversation briefing by Jonathan Este (Feb 13, 2025):

• European reactions  
  – German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock: “This is the way the Trump administration operates… This is not how others do foreign policy, but this is now the reality.”  
  – German defence minister Boris Pistorius: Trump “has already made public concessions to Putin before negotiations have even begun.”  

• U.S. and Western media  
  – New York Times headline: “Putin Scores a Big Victory, and Not on the Battlefield,” arguing Trump’s call ended three years of Russian isolation.  

• Russian media and market response  
  – Commentators claimed the call “broke the west’s blockade.”  
  – Russian stock market rose 5%; rouble strengthened against the dollar.  

• Kremlin spin  
  – Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov compared Trump favorably to Joe Biden:  
    • Said the previous U.S. administration “held the view that everything needed to be done to keep the war going.”  
    • Described the Trump administration as committed to “stopping the war and for peace to prevail,” and said “we are open to dialogue.”  

• Context in Brussels  
  – Call coincided with a meeting of senior European defence officials in Brussels.  
  – U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth outlined Trump’s new European‐security stance:  
    1. Europe’s security “isn’t really America’s problem any more.”  
    2. NATO membership for Ukraine “off the table.”  
    3. Ukraine regaining its 2014 borders “unrealistic.”  
    4. Any peacekeeping force would be European‐led, without U.S. troops or NATO collective‐defense guarantees.

<Summary source="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/19/trump-putin-call-what-they-agreed-to-and-whats-next-for-ukraine-war">
Here is a concise summary of the Al Jazeera article “Trump-Putin call: What they agreed to and what’s next for Ukraine war,” published by Al Jazeera Staff:

• Phone call and 30-day halt  
  – On “Tuesday” President Trump and President Putin held a lengthy telephone call about the war in Ukraine.  
  – Both the White House and the Kremlin announced they had agreed to a 30-day pause on attacks on energy-infrastructure targets in Ukraine and Russia.  
  – Putin did not agree to suspend missile, drone or bomb attacks on the Black Sea or front-line battlefields.  

• Follow-up by Ukraine and next steps  
  – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accepted Trump’s 30-day ceasefire proposal on March 11 and said Kyiv is “ready to talk through further steps,” though he wants full details from Trump.  
  – The US and Russia plan to begin talks on terms for a Black Sea ceasefire.  

• Disagreement in official statements  
  – Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera: “There is a lot we don’t know because there’s a difference between what the White House and Kremlin have reported from this call,” adding that Russia’s extra demands make peace “seem further away.”  
  – The Kremlin statement lists conditions for a full ceasefire across the front line:  
    • Lift all sanctions imposed since February 2022 (including G7/EU measures)  
    • Halt deliveries of cluster munitions to Ukraine  
    • End military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine  
    • Provide mutual security guarantees  
    • Recognize Russia’s claims to Crimea and other occupied territories  
  – The White House statement is notably shorter and does not mention these conditions.  

• Kyiv’s response and aid dynamics  
  – After a fraught Oval Office meeting on February 28—when Trump paused US military aid and intelligence sharing to “teach” Zelenskyy gratitude—Washington restored that assistance upon Kyiv’s agreement to the ceasefire terms on March 11.  
  – Experts say US aid is crucial to Kyiv and its temporary suspension created an unfillable gap.  

• Ongoing attacks on energy infrastructure  
  – Ukraine has increasingly struck Russian oil refineries, pipelines and pumping stations, with Reuters reporting February attacks cut about 10 percent of Russia’s refining capacity.  
  – On Wednesday, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said Ukraine hit an energy facility in the Krasnodar region.  
  – Zelenskyy posted on X that Russian nighttime drone strikes destroyed civilian energy infrastructure—including a hospital in Sumy and sites in Donetsk—and urged the world to reject any attempt by Putin “to prolong the war.”  

• Nuclear plant background  
  – Since early March 2022, Russian forces have occupied Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (six reactors of 1 GW each). Hostilities led Energoatom to shut down the final reactor in September 2022.  

• Expert takeaway  
  – “It is clear the damage that Ukraine has been doing to Russia’s energy infrastructure is something Russia wants to stop,” Giles said.

# Timeline of Phone Communications Between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin: Contexts, Purposes, and Post-Presidential Precedents  

The diplomatic relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has been characterized by frequent direct communication, spanning two U.S. presidential terms and extending into Trump’s post-presidency. This report synthesizes documented phone calls between the two leaders since 2016, analyzes their geopolitical implications, and examines historical precedents for ex-presidents engaging foreign heads of state.  

---

## First Term Communications (2016–2021)  

### November 14, 2016: Post-Election Congratulatory Call  
Trump’s first conversation with Putin occurred days after his 2016 electoral victory. The Kremlin described the discussion as focusing on the “highly unsatisfactory” state of bilateral relations and a mutual desire to restore cooperation on counterterrorism, economic issues, and regional conflicts[9][10]. Trump’s transition team emphasized his intent to forge a “strong and enduring relationship” with Russia, while Putin proposed a face-to-face meeting[10]. This call set the tone for Trump’s unconventional approach to U.S.-Russia diplomacy, bypassing traditional State Department protocols[6].  

### January 28, 2017: Post-Inauguration Strategy Session  
Following Trump’s inauguration, the leaders discussed Ukraine, counterterrorism efforts in Syria, Iran’s nuclear program, and North Korea[11]. Notably, Trump’s willingness to engage Putin on these issues contrasted with bipartisan skepticism in Congress about Russia’s geopolitical intentions, particularly its annexation of Crimea in 2014[1][11].  

### April 4, 2017: Condolences for St. Petersburg Attack  
Trump called Putin to express sympathy after a terrorist attack in the St. Petersburg metro, highlighting a rare moment of humanitarian coordination[11].  

### May 2, November 21, and December 15, 2017: Recurring Diplomatic Coordination  
Three calls in 2017 reinforced discussions on Ukraine, Middle Eastern conflicts, and North Korea’s nuclear ambitions[11]. These conversations occurred alongside ongoing U.S. investigations into Russian election interference, which Trump consistently dismissed as a “hoax”[10].  

### December 17, 2017: Counterterrorism Collaboration  
Putin thanked Trump for CIA intelligence that helped thwart terrorist plots in St. Petersburg, marking a brief détente in intelligence sharing[11].  

### February 12, 2018: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict  
The leaders debated Middle Eastern stability, with Trump seeking Putin’s support for his administration’s peace initiatives[11].  

### March 20, 2018: Post-Election Congratulations  
Trump congratulated Putin on his re-election, a gesture criticized by U.S. lawmakers given Russia’s authoritarian political landscape[11].  

---

## Post-Presidential Communications (2021–2024)  

### Alleged Private Calls (2021–2024)  
Bob Woodward’s book *War* revealed that Trump allegedly held up to seven private calls with Putin after leaving office, including a February 2024 discussion where Trump reportedly asked an aide to vacate his Mar-a-Lago office for privacy[12][14]. These calls, which bypassed official diplomatic channels, raised concerns about potential violations of the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments[6][14]. Woodward also documented Trump’s secret delivery of COVID-19 tests to Putin in 2020, a transaction Trump agreed to conceal[14].  

---

## Second Term Communications (2025–Present)  

### February 12, 2025: Ceasefire Negotiations and Prisoner Exchange  
During Trump’s second term, a “lengthy and highly productive” call focused on initiating Ukraine peace talks, Middle Eastern stability, artificial intelligence, and energy policy[4]. The leaders agreed to a prisoner swap involving American teacher Marc Fogel and Russian national Alexander Vinnik, framed by Trump as a goodwill gesture[4][8].  

### March 18, 2025: Ukraine Ceasefire and Bilateral Normalization  
A 90-minute call culminated in an agreement to halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, though Russia later attached conditions, including a freeze on Western arms supplies to Ukraine[1][3][8][13]. Trump touted the discussion as a step toward “complete ceasefire,” while analysts noted Putin’s strategic pivot to broader U.S.-Russia cooperation on global security and economic issues[13]. Kremlin narratives framed the call as a reset toward “multipolar world” dynamics, emphasizing hockey diplomacy and mutual economic interests[13].  

---

## Precedents for Ex-Presidents Contacting Foreign Leaders  

Post-term presidential engagement with foreign leaders is atypical and often scrutinized. While former presidents like Jimmy Carter have mediated international conflicts (e.g., North Korea visits in 1994 and 2010), such activities are usually conducted transparently and in coordination with the sitting administration[15]. Trump’s alleged private calls with Putin deviate from this norm, echoing Cold War-era fears of backchannel diplomacy. The Logan Act, though rarely enforced, legally restricts unauthorized citizens from influencing foreign disputes[6][14]. General Mark Milley’s 2020 calls with Chinese counterparts—intended to reassure Beijing during Trump’s election challenges—similarly sparked debates about protocol, though Milley acted within military channels[17].  

---

## Analytical Conclusion  

Trump’s direct diplomacy with Putin reflects a persistent preference for personal rapport over institutional process, yielding mixed results. While the 2025 ceasefire agreements temporarily reduced hostilities, Russia’s enduring maximalist goals in Ukraine suggest limited long-term concessions[1][13]. Historians will likely debate whether Trump’s post-presidential calls crossed ethical or legal boundaries, particularly given Woodward’s allegations[12][14]. Comparatively, the lack of precedent for such frequent ex-president foreign engagement underscores the uniqueness of Trump’s approach, contrasting sharply with traditional diplomatic norms.</Perplexity_report>

<Summary source="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/europe/analysis-putin-trump-phone-call-ukraine-intl-latam">
Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the CNN article by Nick Paton Walsh (March 18, 2025).  

1. Key Facts and Figures  
• Trump administration asked for a 30-day, frontline-wide ceasefire in Ukraine, without conditions.  
• After a week-long wait, the Kremlin and White House agreed to:  
  – Swap 175 prisoners and return 23 seriously wounded Ukrainians (due to occur as early as the next day).  
  – A mutual, month-long pause on attacks against “energy infrastructure.”  
• Russia immediately resumed nightly air assaults on Ukraine’s front lines.  
• Historically, Russia has severed Ukraine’s electricity grids and gas supplies each winter; Ukraine has struck Russian oil refineries and pipelines with long-range drones and missiles, damaging a key Kremlin revenue source.  

2. Positions and Statements from Named, Reliable Sources  
• Kremlin readout: the pause covers only “energy infrastructure” (electricity grids, gas pipelines).  
• President Trump and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt (via social media): described the pause as covering “energy and infrastructure” (a broader term that could include bridges, roads, ports, railways).  
• Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: “I still need to know the details” of any pause.  
• US Senator (and Secretary of State nominee) Marco Rubio: suggested satellites could monitor compliance.  

3. Kremlin Diplomatic Strategy (per the article)  
• Russia conditioned further talks on halting all foreign aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine.  
• Proposed “working groups” on Ukraine and Russia–US relations (described as a euphemism for disinterest).  
• Executed only the energy-related pause immediately; left other conditions ambiguous and for future meetings.  
• Seeks to renew its long-standing tactic of embedding technical loopholes to avoid substantive concessions.  

4. Analysis and Interpretive Observations (CNN author’s perspective) – less directly sourced  
• The Trump administration has been “hopelessly bluffed” by Russia’s pedantic diplomacy.  
• The initial Jeddah ceasefire proposal was “admirable but wildly simplistic,” failing to address command-and-control realities or monitoring mechanisms.  
• The Kremlin offered the minimum concessions needed to avoid a flat “no,” packaging it as a “partial ceasefire.”  
• The discrepant US/Russia readouts expose a lack of coordinated staff work and foreshadow further confusion.  
• The outcome confirms that Putin feels able to outmaneuver Trump in their first direct diplomatic engagement.  

Overall, the call produced only a minor prisoner exchange and a narrowly defined pause on energy-related attacks, while leaving broader ceasefire questions—and the future of US aid and Ukraine’s counter-strikes—open and subject to further Kremlin negotiation tactics.
</Summary>

<Summary source="https://kyivindependent.com/trump-says-eu-leaders-asked-him-to-call-putin-claiming-russian-president-ignored-their-calls/">
• On May 4, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, President Trump said European Union leaders have “asked me to call Putin so many times” because “he doesn’t return their phone call.”  
• Trump’s remarks coincided with the end of his self-imposed 100-day deadline to broker a Russia–Ukraine peace settlement, which produced no agreement.  
• He reiterated his claim that the war “would not have occurred if I had remained in office” and stated he believes a peace deal “is possible” and that “we think we’re fairly close.”  
• Trump also said on April 26 he feels Putin may be “tapping me along” and might not actually want to end the war.  
• Contrary to Trump’s suggestion that EU leaders can’t reach Putin, outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke by phone with Putin on November 15, 2024—his first direct call in nearly two years. Ukrainian President Zelensky warned that Scholz’s call risked opening a “Pandora’s box” of talks that could weaken Kyiv’s position.  
• Other European leaders have met Putin in person: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico both visited Moscow. Fico is also expected to attend Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on May 9 and has publicly criticized Zelensky for urging foreign delegations to stay away from the parade.

• Trump (Truth Social): “Vladimir, STOP!”—a capstone on what he calls one of the least successful negotiations ever.  
• New York Times reporters and foreign-policy experts: a negotiated settlement of the Ukraine war was “the only real viable option.”  
• Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen (March 2025): because “Russia is incredibly weak…Trump holds all the cards.”  
• Sen. J.D. Vance (2024 campaign): Ukraine needed “some kind of security guarantee…a heavily fortified demilitarized zone.”  
• Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: proposed $100 billion from NATO funds plus $500 billion in lend-lease loans for Ukraine.  
• Rep. Mike Waltz (Nov 2024): the U.S. has “plenty of leverage” on both Ukraine and Russia—via oil sales crackdowns and more weapons for Ukraine.  

Sequence of expectations vs. reality  
1. Assumption: Putin, weak and desperate for relief, would trade territory for a pause in fighting and security guarantees.  
2. Trump’s boast: “I would tell Putin, ‘If you don’t make a deal, we’re going to give [Ukraine] more than they ever got.’ ”  
3. Result: Putin gave up nothing material. Instead, Russia demands:  
   – Ukraine be demilitarized.  
   – All Western arms and economic aid be cut off.  
   – No European or U.S. peacekeepers (seen by Moscow as a backdoor NATO force).  
4. Trump and VP Vance have had to “manufacture” concessions—e.g., calling as a win the theoretical Russian agreement not to seize the entire country.  

Russian position (Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov)  
• Russia is “ready to reach a deal” but needs to “fine-tune” U.S. proposals—i.e. ensure Ukraine remains isolated, unarmed, and unprotected.  
• Kremlin insists no cease-fire unless the West stops arming Ukraine.  

Core critique  
• The American peace plan:  
   – No post-settlement U.S. aid to Ukraine.  
   – No limits on how small Ukraine’s armed forces would be.  
   – Requires Ukraine to recognize Russian control of Crimea and other occupied territories up front.  
• Trump has asked Ukraine to surrender its most crucial concession before Russia has agreed to any security guarantees.  

Broader insight  
• Kagan argues this failure reflects both Trump’s self-delusion as a dealmaker and a broader shift in post-Cold-War diplomacy.  
• Trump’s apparent aim was a “decent interval” (à la Kissinger’s Vietnam settlement) rather than Ukraine’s lasting security—seeking only to shift the problem out of U.S. hands.

<Summary source="https://www.vox.com/the-logoff-newsletter-trump/404922/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire">
Here’s a concise summary of Joshua Keating’s March 18, 2025 Vox article “Trump’s call with Putin, briefly explained”:

• Context and main event  
  – Earlier today, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held a lengthy phone call.  
  – That call follows both Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressing support for a 30-day pause in attacks on “energy and infrastructure” (power plants, refineries, etc.).

• What Putin did (and didn’t) agree to  
  – He declined Trump’s proposal for a full ceasefire (which Ukraine had earlier accepted).  
  – In a post-call statement, Russia said it would only back the 30-day pause if foreign countries cut off military and intelligence aid to Ukraine—a condition Trump has not accepted.

• What hasn’t changed on the ground  
  – Fighting along front lines will continue, as will drone and missile strikes on Ukrainian cities.  
  – The U.S. will keep supplying weapons and intelligence to Ukraine, reversing a brief suspension earlier in March.

• Big-picture reads  
  – Optimistic: The U.S.-brokered talks could be a stepping stone toward a broader ceasefire.  
  – Pessimistic: Russian officials still aim for a demilitarized, subservient Ukraine, and Putin may be merely placating Trump while maintaining battlefield pressure.

• Implications for Trump’s stance  
  – He stopped short of “selling Ukraine out,” as some feared, but also did not press Putin to agree to a genuine ceasefire.  
  – Trump’s public reaction suggests he was satisfied with the call’s outcome despite Putin’s refusal to back down.

• Author’s aside on social media  
  – Keating closes with a personal note, highlighting a Vox colleague Allie Volpe’s piece on our craving for external validation online.  
  – He quotes Volpe: “What is far more nourishing than the sugar high of validation is an internal process of recognizing your own worthiness.”  

No forecast or additional context has been added beyond what appears in the article.

<Summary source="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/19/no-betrayal-ukraine-breathes-sigh-of-relief-after-trump-putin-talks">
Al Jazeera (Mansur Mirovalev) reports on Ukrainian reactions and expert analysis following the February 2025 phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin:

Facts and figures  
• Minutes after the two‐hour call, Russia launched 145 drones and six missiles at Ukraine from six sites in western Russia; 45 drones struck the Kyiv region.  
• Ukrainian officials said civilian infrastructure was damaged but there were no casualties.  

Official Ukrainian response  
• President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: the strikes were “a way of rejecting Trump’s 30-day ceasefire proposal” and showed “Putin virtually threw away” the offer.  
• Ukraine offered to suspend air, sea and energy‐infrastructure attacks for 30 days – a plan first outlined in March talks in Jeddah – and Zelenskyy said, “Our side will support it.”  

Public sentiment  
• Larysa Kozhedub, 52-year-old manicurist from Kyiv (nephew killed near Pokrovsk): “Putin shows that Trump is nothing but his lap dog. America lost the Cold War, and Ukraine is paying for it.”  

Analyst opinions (named, reliable)  
• Volodymyr Fesenko (Penta think tank, Kyiv):  
  – No “betrayal” by Trump; he resisted Putin’s demands to halt US military aid and Ukraine’s mobilisation.  
  – Phone call may set the pace for a phased ceasefire: first halt energy‐targeting strikes (psychologically reassuring), then suspend air attacks (would reduce air-raid sirens but have limited tactical effect).  
  – Warning: Russia will issue further ultimatums in upcoming talks.  
• Igar Tyshkevych (Kyiv analyst):  
  – Beyond Ukraine, Trump and Putin discussed the Middle East, Red Sea security, nuclear non-proliferation; Kremlin claims Russia offered to help on Iran’s nuclear programme and Yemen’s Houthis.  
  – He cautions that Iran may not want Russia as a middleman, and if Moscow does deliver on Middle East help, it will demand concessions in Ukraine.  
  – Trump needs a rapid peace framework ahead of talks with China’s Xi Jinping.  
• Nikolay Mitrokhin (University of Bremen researcher):  
  – Russia is “fragmenting” the Ukrainian conflict by demanding separate negotiations on Black Sea warfare.  
  – Kyiv’s agreement to halt Black Sea strikes would be a “political and military defeat” – Ukraine already lost islands in the Dnieper delta and failed to retake others west of Crimea.  
  – Warns that Putin could exploit any pause to launch new assaults (“meat marches”) in Donetsk, though Ukraine’s recent raids on Russia’s Belgorod region might deter further advances.  

Less‐attributed perspectives  
• Some unnamed Ukrainians described relief that Trump did not agree to Russia’s full ceasefire terms, but remained wary of any deal that might limit Kyiv’s military operations.  

Overall, survey of reactions indicates Ukrainians are cautiously relieved that Trump did not accede to Russia’s main demands, but both public and experts warn that any partial ceasefire deal will leave Ukraine vulnerable to further Russian ultimatums and limited tactical benefit.

Trump, in an interview with NBC News, expressed doubts about the possibility of a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, citing the deep personal animosity between Putin and Zelensky as a significant obstacle to dialogue. He added, 'A tremendous hatred between some soldiers, to be honest. Between generals. They fought hard for three years.'

**Kremlin Calls for Trump-Putin Meeting, Amid Ongoing Conflict**
The Kremlin has called for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, deeming it 'necessary' but also stating that 'there's nothing concrete' at the moment. Trump has reiterated that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict must end 'now'. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesperson, said that the Russian-American summit 'must be prepared in an appropriate manner', but it will not take place in Saudi Arabia as previously suggested. Trump has spoken with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been the only one to facilitate negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in the past three years. 'I'm looking forward to collaborating with President Erdogan to put an end to the ridiculous, but deadly, war between Russia and Ukraine, NOW!' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth. Meanwhile, the new US ambassador to Ukraine, Julie Davis, has arrived in Kiev, replacing Bridget Brink who was removed in April. Putin is preparing for a week of intense diplomatic activity, with the arrival of over 20 leaders in Moscow for the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazism. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not be present due to tensions with Pakistan. The EU has issued a harsh statement against China for Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, scheduled from May 7 to 10. Zelensky has rejected Putin's proposal for a three-day ceasefire from May 8 to 10, warning that Ukraine cannot 'guarantee the safety' of participants at the May 9 parade. In recent hours, four drones launched by Ukrainian forces have been shot down in a southern suburb of Moscow, causing 'minor damage' to residential buildings and cars in the Podolsk district. The Russian Defense Ministry has stated that 23 drones were intercepted in the night between Sunday and Monday in other Russian regions, with 5 in Kaluga and 17 in Kursk. However, the governor of Kursk has reported three deaths and three injuries due to the drone attacks.

**Trump Claims European Leaders Asked Him to Call Putin Amid Ukraine Conflict**
US President Donald Trump claimed that European leaders have repeatedly asked him to call Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Putin allegedly ignored their calls. Trump made this statement in an interview with NBC, reiterating his claim that Russia has ambitions to capture all of Ukraine. According to Trump, he was the one who stopped Russia's further advance. Trump believes that Russia should give up Ukrainian territories. He said, 'Russia will have to give up all of Ukraine. Because Russia wants all of Ukraine. And if I hadn't intervened, they (Ukrainians) would be fighting for all of Ukraine right now. Russia doesn't want the part of Ukraine it has now; Russia wants all of Ukraine. And if it weren't for me, they (Russians) wouldn't have stopped. You know, the leaders of the European Union have asked me to call Putin so many times? Because he doesn't answer their calls,' Trump said. Trump also recalled a conversation with Putin, in which, according to him, it became clear that Joe Biden had never called the Russian leader during the full-scale war. In his opinion, Putin's ambitions 'are largely stopped' now, as he has seen that Trump took up the peaceful resolution. Trump said, 'Because he didn't have anything to do with anyone in Europe, he didn't call them back. You know, I asked him, I said: 'Did Biden call you in the last three years? Did Biden call you even once?' He replied: 'He never called.' You know, Biden never called him once,' Trump said. Earlier, Trump stated that he and his advisors had recently had several useful discussions about Russia and Ukraine. At the same time, he 'did not think' about the possibility of a meeting with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia. As reported by OBOZ.UA, in April, the Kremlin stated that there is ongoing preparatory work in the US and Russia regarding the organization of a meeting between Trump and Putin. Following this, Moscow claimed that Putin is not currently planning to hold a new conversation with the US President, but he is allegedly constantly sending 'signals' about his readiness for a peaceful process.'

However, the Kremlin noted that there was no request from Macron for a phone call, and no real steps were taken in this direction. In February 2025, Putin reminded that Russia has never refused contacts with Europeans on Ukraine, but Europeans have stopped contacting Moscow.

Putin previously confirmed Russia's readiness for negotiations with Ukraine without preconditions, according to Peskov. Trump previously stated that he believes Russia is ready to make a deal to resolve the conflict, but negotiations with Kyiv have been unsuccessful so far. The last phone call between Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz took place on November 15, 2024, initiated by Berlin. In March 2025, French President Emmanuel Macron stated that his dialogue with Putin could resume, but a conversation may take place 'at the right moment,' with the Kremlin noting that there was no request from Macron for a phone call and no real steps were taken in this direction. In February 2025, Putin reminded that Russia never refused contacts with Europeans on Ukraine, but Europeans stopped contacting Moscow.

**Russia Awaits Signal from Ukraine to Resume Negotiations**
Russia is waiting for actions from Ukraine to resume negotiations, said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. According to him, the current obstacle is the legal ban on negotiations imposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in October 2022. 'We don't see any actions yet,' Peskov emphasized. In response to former US President Donald Trump's recent call for Russia to stop attacks on Ukrainian targets, Peskov stated that the special military operation continues. However, he confirmed that Moscow is ready to negotiate with Ukrainian authorities without preconditions, and recalled President Vladimir Putin's repeated statements on his willingness to engage in dialogue.

**Putin to Call Xi Jinping Ahead of Trump Meeting, Seeking Understanding and Trust**
Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to call Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss the recent Russia-US talks, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The call is seen as a move to gain Xi's understanding and trust before the upcoming Putin-Trump meeting. Analysts believe that Putin may be trying to reassure Xi that Russia's relations with the US will not affect its ties with China. China's scholars argue that the Sino-Russian relationship is too complex and intertwined to be easily broken. 'It's not mature to think that if the US and Russia reach an agreement to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it will lead to a deterioration of Sino-Russian relations,' said Zhang Yiwu, vice president of the China Globalization Research Center. 'Russia will not fully trust Trump, and it will not sacrifice its friendly and equal relationship with China for the sake of the US.'

**Kremlin Sees Trump's Call as Signal for Dialogue Over War**
The Kremlin views US President Donald Trump's call to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a turning point in the Ukraine war. According to Putin's spokesperson Dmitri Peskow, 'This is a signal that we are trying to clarify things through dialogue and talk about peace, rather than war.' Peskow criticized Western leaders for previously rejecting talks with Russia and pursuing a 'war to the end' strategy. However, he noted that the bilateral relationship between the two countries is still heavily damaged and requires significant preparation for a meeting. Peskow did not specify a date for a potential meeting, but mentioned that Saudi Arabia has been proposed as a possible location for a summit to discuss ending the Russian invasion. He also stated that a deal is possible, but that Russia will not forget the betrayal of the Minsk Agreement, which froze the conflict in Ukraine in 2014/2015. Peskow emphasized that Russia has learned to protect its interests and will take this experience into account in future agreements.

**Trump's Call with Putin: A Signal to China or a Dead End?**
Political philosopher and analyst Alexander Morozov believes that Donald Trump's recent statements on the war in Ukraine are aimed at sending a signal to the Chinese leadership that they share a similar understanding of the situation. Morozov notes that the war is 'senseless' and that it is causing significant economic and human losses. He suggests that Trump may use this position to persuade China to join him in urging Vladimir Putin to end the war. However, Morozov is skeptical that this approach will lead to significant results, as Putin is unlikely to change his stance. He believes that the initiative will eventually pass to European countries, which will take the lead in resolving the situation. Morozov also notes that the US Congress will continue to condemn both Putin and the Kremlin for their policies, which are seen as contrary to all possible principles.

**Putin's Growing Impatience with Trump's Delayed Call**
The Kremlin is growing impatient with the delay in the first phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump. Serguéi Riabkov, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, said, 'This topic comes up almost every day, and we give the same response: there are no developments. The restoration of political dialogue is, without a doubt, necessary.' The conflict in Ukraine is the most pressing issue, but there are other urgent matters to discuss between Moscow and Washington, such as NATO expansion, a new strategic arms control treaty, and a new security architecture. It has been almost two weeks since Trump's inauguration, and the Kremlin is still waiting for the call. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping before taking office and has since spoken with friendly leaders like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Yuri Ushakov, Kremlin International Affairs Adviser, said, 'It is usually the incoming president who makes the first phone call.' The Kremlin's Spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, confirmed diplomatic contacts regarding the recent plane crash in Washington but denied any communication between the two administrations. Trump confirmed contacts with Moscow at the embassy level to repatriate Russian victims of the crash. Putin has sent signals to Washington through his preferred interlocutor, Pavel Zarubin, a journalist from the state-owned television channel. Putin said, 'It would be good to meet and discuss all the issues that interest both the US and Russia.' He believes Russia can have 'many points of coincidence' with the new US administration. Putin also made a comment about Trump's 2020 election loss, saying, 'If he hadn't been robbed of the victory, perhaps the crisis in Ukraine wouldn't have occurred in 2022.' The tone hardened on January 28 when Putin said, 'You can negotiate with anyone, but due to his illegitimacy, he (Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky) has no right to sign anything.' The situation has been complicated by the delay in granting approval to the new Russian Ambassador, Alexandr Darchíev, after his predecessor left the post before the US presidential elections. Riabkov said, 'We are in a state of waiting. Time is running out. We are not yet in a state of alarm, but we are getting closer to it. That's why I would like to receive a signal from Washington about a positive decision.'

**Kremlin: Putin Ready to Talk to Trump, Waiting for Word From Washington**
Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to hold a phone call with President Donald Trump, but Moscow is waiting for a signal from Washington. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, 'Putin is ready. We are waiting for signals (from Washington). Everyone is ready. It is difficult to read the coffee grounds here. As soon as there is something, if there is something, we will inform you.' Trump expressed his desire to meet Putin to secure an end to the war with Ukraine and work towards cutting nuclear arms. Peskov said Putin had made it clear he wanted to resume nuclear disarmament negotiations, but such talks would need to be wider than in the past to cover other countries' nuclear arsenals. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is due to run out on Feb. 5, 2026, and is the last remaining pillar of nuclear arms control between the US and Russia.

**Ahead of the expected Trump-Putin call, each side stakes out its position**
Ahead of a potential phone call between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, both sides are staking out their positions on the Ukraine war. Kremlin hard-liners are calling for the dismemberment of Ukraine, while Trump is threatening new sanctions if Putin doesn't come to the negotiating table. Trump has called for a swift resolution to the war and has threatened to impose 'high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States' unless Putin agrees to a peace deal with Ukraine. Russian officials, however, are playing down any imminent major breakthrough on U.S.-Russia ties and are doubling down on their hard-line positions, believing Russia can seize more territory and force Kyiv to accept a deal later in the year. 'In spring the conditions won't be ripe for an end to the war,' said Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin analyst. 'But by autumn, while Trump reduces financing and while the Russian army makes further progress, maybe by then there will be better political conditions.'

**Russia Awaits 'Signals' from Trump Team Ahead of Inauguration**
Russia's assistant to the president for international affairs, Yuri Ushakov, stated that there are currently no contacts between the Russian and US teams regarding a possible meeting between President Vladimir Putin and President-elect Donald Trump. Ushakov said, 'We are calmly waiting for the Trump team to take their places, for Trump to enter the Oval Office. And then we'll see what happens next. We are calmly waiting for the signals.' Ushakov explained that if discussions begin, they will first be through closed channels between the White House and the Kremlin, and only then may a direct contact between the leaders of the two countries occur.

   - Summary: Reviews international reactions to Trump-Putin communications
   - Quality: Academic analysis platform with reliable analytical content
   - European perspectives: German officials expressed concern about Trump's negotiation approach

6. **Al Jazeera Article (March 2025)**
   - Summary: Details the March 18 call outcomes, focusing on 30-day ceasefire agreement
   - Quality: Reputable international news organization
   - Key fact: Despite agreement, both sides reported continuing attacks on energy infrastructure after the announced ceasefire

7. **Perplexity Report**
   - Summary: Comprehensive timeline of Trump-Putin communications since 2016
   - Quality: Synthesized information with citations but requires verification
   - Valuable context: Shows patterns of communication during Trump's first term (9+ calls) and second term (2 confirmed calls in early 2025)

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Most suitable reference classes:

1. **Trump-Putin calls during second term (2025)** - MOST RELEVANT
   - Two confirmed calls in less than 4 months (Feb 12 and Mar 18, 2025)
   - Approximately 0.5-0.6 calls per month; average interval of ~34 days
   - Directly applicable to current circumstances and individuals

2. **Trump-Putin calls during first term (2017-2021)**
   - At least 9 confirmed calls over 4 years (~0.19 calls per month)
   - Less frequent but establishes historical pattern of direct communication

3. **Current diplomatic negotiations context**
   - Active Ukraine ceasefire discussions with ongoing violations reported
   - Russia's explicit statement about continuing "contacts as necessary"

The current second-term communication pattern is most relevant, given it involves the exact same actors in their current roles during an active diplomatic process.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction covers May 6 - June 15, 2025 (40 days). Key timing considerations:

- Last confirmed call (March 18) was 49 days ago, exceeding the average interval of ~34 days
- 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire negotiated on March 18 would have expired in mid-April
- Both sides have reportedly accused each other of ceasefire violations (Al Jazeera)
- The forecast period (40 days) represents 1.33 months, which at current communication rates (0.5-0.6 calls/month) suggests 0.67-0.8 expected calls

## (d) Justification

Several factors support a high probability of a call during this period:

1. The established communication pattern in 2025 shows calls occurring approximately every 34 days, with the last call 49 days ago (suggesting we're "overdue" based on previous cadence)

2. The Kremlin explicitly stated that both leaders "confirmed their intention to continue contacts as necessary" and that Ukraine's continued strikes could "absolutely" prompt another call (Reuters)

3. The 30-day ceasefire agreement from March 18 expired in mid-April, with both sides reportedly violating terms, creating a clear trigger for follow-up discussion

4. Trump has consistently demonstrated preference for direct leader-to-leader diplomacy, bypassing traditional channels

5. The diplomatic process remains active, with scheduled U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh described as steps toward a possible face-to-face meeting

Counterbalancing factors:
- Preparations for an in-person meeting might replace a phone call
- Complete diplomatic breakdown could temporarily halt communications

# Outside view calibration:

Starting with the baseline frequency, two calls in approximately 4 months yields a rate of 0.5-0.6 calls per month, suggesting approximately 0.67-0.8 expected calls in the 40-day forecast period. This translates to roughly a 67-80% probability.

However, several factors suggest this is a conservative estimate:

1. We're already beyond the established average interval between calls (49 days since last call vs. average 34-day interval)

2. The Kremlin spokesperson's explicit statement that the presidents would "continue contacts as necessary" and that Ukraine's actions could "absolutely" prompt another call

3. The expired ceasefire agreement and reported violations create a specific trigger that makes communication more likely

4. The active diplomatic process suggests continued leader-level engagement

Given these considerations, particularly that we're already well beyond the typical interval, I believe the probability is at the higher end of the range suggested by the frequency analysis.

# Outside View Prediction:
78%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **NBC News (Oct 2024)**: Reports Trump and Putin allegedly spoke up to 7 times since 2021 based on Woodward's book. Quality is mixed - relies on single anonymous source for one incident, with Trump denying claims. This historical report offers limited predictive value but establishes precedent for Trump-Putin direct communications.

2. **Reuters (March 2025)**: High-quality reporting confirming two official calls in 2025 (February 12, March 18) with official statements from both sides. Kremlin spokesperson Peskov's statement that they "can't rule out everything else" and will "continue contacts as necessary" is particularly relevant. Trump told Washington Examiner he "had been speaking to the Russian leader for weeks."

3. **Russia Matters (March 2025)**: Provides detailed analysis of March 18 call including the 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire agreement. Highlights divergent U.S. and Russian readouts, showing each side's different diplomatic priorities.

4. **ABC News**: Analyzes Ukraine implications of Trump-Putin calls, noting this diplomatic outreach ends Putin's pariah status. Includes substantive expert opinion from Tatiana Stanovaya (Carnegie) who suggests Putin will offer cosmetic concessions while pursuing long-term goals.

5. **The Conversation (Feb 2025)**: Provides European reactions to Trump-Putin communications, with less direct relevance to predicting future calls.

6. **Al Jazeera (March 2025)**: Details the 30-day infrastructure attack pause agreed on March 18, with expert analysis from Keir Giles (Chatham House) noting the gap between U.S. and Russian statements suggests peace "seems further away."

7. **Perplexity Report**: Comprehensive timeline showing Trump-Putin communications pattern: 9+ calls during first term (2017-2021), alleged 7 calls during post-presidency (2021-2024), and 2 confirmed calls in 2025 (February 12, March 18).

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several reference classes are relevant:

1. **Recent call frequency (2025)**: Two confirmed calls in 3.5 months (Feb 12, Mar 18), averaging one call every 7 weeks.

2. **First Trump term call frequency**: At least 9 calls over 4 years, averaging one call every 5-6 months.

3. **Post-agreement follow-up pattern**: Major agreements typically trigger follow-up communications at implementation milestones.

4. **Crisis communication timing**: Leaders tend to communicate more frequently during evolving crises.

The most appropriate reference class is the 2025 pattern combined with the post-agreement follow-up pattern, as both reflect current diplomatic dynamics and the specific Ukraine conflict context.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

We're forecasting a 34-day window (May 12 - June 15, 2025), with today being May 6, 2025.

- Last confirmed call: March 18, 2025 (7 weeks ago)
- Based on the 2025 pattern (one call every ~7 weeks), the next expected call would fall around May 6-13, partially within our prediction window
- The 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire from March 18 would have expired in mid-April
- If that agreement was extended by another 30 days (which we don't know), the next follow-up would be mid-May, directly in our prediction window

## (d) Justification

Several factors support the likelihood of a call within our timeframe:

1. **Established communication pattern**: Two confirmed calls in 2025 already, with the next expected call (based on ~7-week frequency) falling around our window.

2. **Official commitment to future contact**: Kremlin's Peskov explicitly stated both presidents "confirmed their intention to continue contacts as necessary."

3. **Agreement follow-up needs**: The March energy infrastructure agreement requires assessment and potential extension, creating a natural reason for communication within our timeframe.

4. **Ongoing Ukraine war developments**: The conflict continues to evolve, creating urgent matters requiring leader-level discussion.

5. **Political incentives**: Trump has positioned himself as a peacemaker who can deal directly with Putin, making continued communication politically advantageous.

Factors decreasing likelihood:

1. **Uncertainty about intervening calls**: We don't know if unannounced calls occurred between March 18 and now.

2. **Potential shift to other channels**: Communication could move to in-person meetings or intermediaries.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I need to weigh the evidence systematically:

- The two confirmed calls in 2025 occurred approximately 5 weeks apart (Feb 12 to Mar 18)
- If this pattern holds, the subsequent calls would be expected around April 22 and May 27 (the latter falling within our window)
- This pattern yields approximately a 66% chance of a call in our 34-day window
- The need to follow up on the energy infrastructure agreement increases this probability
- Peskov's explicit statement about continuing contacts as necessary further increases the likelihood
- I must discount slightly for the possibility that communication patterns have changed or shifted to other channels

The historical pattern and diplomatic context strongly suggest continued direct communication, with the timing aligning with our forecast window.

## Outside View Prediction:
75%

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   - Reuters (Mar 23, 2025): High-quality reporting. Confirms two publicly announced calls in 2025 (Feb 12, Mar 18) and notes unconfirmed reports of a November call. Opinions from Kremlin spokesman Peskov and Trump are clearly labeled. Factual core: 2 calls in ~10 weeks.  
   - NBC News (Oct 8, 2024): Cites Woodward’s book claiming “up to seven” private calls since 2021. Woodward is a respected journalist, but many calls rest on a single anonymous aide. Treat these extra-official calls as low-confidence data.  
   - Russia Matters (Mar 18, 2025 call readout): Detailed breakdown of the March call’s duration, topics, and divergent White House vs. Kremlin readouts. Factual on call length and parameters; analysis of motives is expert opinion.  
   - ABC News, The Conversation, Al Jazeera: All describe the same March call, each adding color on international reactions and stakes. Useful to corroborate that March 18 was a major, well-publicized call.  
   - Perplexity report (timeline): Provides a comprehensive chronology of Trump–Putin contacts from 2016 through March 2025, including official calls in‐office and alleged post‐term calls. Mixes high-confidence dates with lower-confidence allegations; use primarily for establishing broad patterns (e.g., Trump unusually active).

2. Reference-class analysis  
   Possible reference classes for call frequency:  
   a. Official Trump–Putin calls in his second term (Jan–Mar 2025): 2 calls in ~10 weeks → ~0.8 calls/month.  
   b. U.S. presidential calls to Russian presidents historically: Obama–Putin reportedly 3–5 calls/year (~0.3–0.4 calls/month). Trump’s pattern is higher—reflecting his personal diplomacy style.  
   c. Ex-president private calls to foreign leaders: extremely rare and seldom publicized—poor match for forecast resolution, which requires public acknowledgment by both sides.  

   The most suitable reference class is (a), since it directly measures the rate of acknowledged calls in the current term under the same actors and similar stakes.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Today is May 6, 2025; window closes June 15, 2025 ⇒ 40 days ≈ 1.33 months.  
   – From Jan 20 to Mar 18 (~2 months), there were 2 calls ⇒ 1 call/month. If that pace continued, we'd expect ~1.33 calls in our 1.33-month window.  
   – Using a simple Poisson model with λ = 1 call/month: expected calls in 1.33 months = 1.33 ⇒ P(≥1) = 1 – e^(–1.33) ≈ 74%.  
   – However, the Jan–Mar window included an unusually heavy diplomatic push (ceasefire talks). Outside of that peak, the longer Jan–May pace is 2 calls in 3.5 months ⇒ ~0.57 calls/month. Then λ = 0.57 × 1.33 ≈ 0.76 ⇒ P(≥1) ≈ 1 – e^(–0.76) ≈ 53%.  

4. Justification  
   – Baseline rate of publicly acknowledged calls this term lies between 0.6–1.0 calls/month, weighted toward the lower end if one treats the Feb and Mar calls as a special ceasefire push.  
   – There is no scheduled public event between May 12 and June 15 that strongly demands another Trump–Putin call; the next big item is perhaps follow-up on ceasefire or summer summits, but a face-to-face in-person meeting may be prioritized over a phone call.  
   – Both leaders have signaled they will maintain contacts “as necessary,” but after the intense March session, the tempo is likely to slow.  
   – No major public crises appear imminent that would force an extraordinary call.  
   – Therefore a call remains plausible but not highly likely under a cooling diplomatic cycle.  

Outside view calibration:

Starting from the Poisson estimate of ~53%, we adjust modestly downward to reflect:
   – The probability that any unannounced calls won’t meet the resolution’s requirement of both sides publicly acknowledging the phone link.  
   – Slight calendar drag: mid-May to mid-June is often a slow diplomatic period before summer breaks.  
   – Offsetting this: Trump’s demonstrated willingness to pick up the phone privately even when aides disagree.  

Net adjustment: –5 points → Outside-view probability ≈48%.

Outside View Prediction:

I assess a 48% chance that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will publicly acknowledge a phone call between May 12 and June 15, 2025.

      – Strengths: direct quotations of conditions; balanced presentation of White House vs. Kremlin positions.  
      – Weaknesses: focus on ceasefire terms, not on likelihood of future calls.  
      – Factual content: the exact list of Kremlin conditions for a broader ceasefire.  
      – Opinion content: expert takeaway that Russia’s energy-infrastructure strikes are “something Russia wants to stop.”  

   g. Perplexity report  
      – Provides a timeline of Trump–Putin calls from 2016 to 2025 and historical precedents of ex-presidential diplomacy.  
      – Strengths: compiles known, public calls during Trump’s presidency; flags Logan Act questions.  
      – Weaknesses: intermixes in-office calls (2016–2021) with post-presidency claims; Woodward-derived allegations ambiguously presented.  
      – Factual content: dates of White House–announced calls; Carter’s post-term mediation precedents.  
      – Opinion content: classification of Trump’s calls as “deviating from norms,” which is interpretive.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
   Possible classes:  
   a. “All phone calls between U.S. and Russian heads of state in times of major conflict” – too broad, different U.S. administrations have different styles.  
   b. “Trump–Putin phone calls during Trump’s presidency (2017–2021)” – many in-office calls but under very different political context.  
   c. “Trump–Putin phone calls since Trump’s second inauguration (2025)” – small but well-defined set; directly analogous context.  
   d. “Post-inaugural U.S. president calls on foreign leaders” – too generic.  

   Suitability: class (c) is the most directly comparable: it captures the dynamic of two leaders who have already shown a willingness to speak by phone shortly before.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Forecast window: 39 days (May 12, 2025 – June 15, 2025).  
   – Historic pattern in class (c): two confirmed calls over 90 days (Feb 12 and Mar 18).  
   – Implied rate: ~1 call per 45 days.  
   – Poisson approximation: λ ≈ (39/45) ≈ 0.87 expected calls → P(at least one) = 1 – e^(–0.87) ≈ 1 – 0.42 ≈ 0.58.  

4. Justification  
   – The most reliable reporting (Reuters) confirms a steady cadence of roughly one call every six to seven weeks under the current administration.  
   – Both sides have publicly signaled an intention to maintain contact “as necessary” on Ukraine and other theaters.  
   – No major political barrier has emerged to prevent another call in late spring (no obvious summit, but the war in Ukraine remains active, providing impetus).  
   – The window (39 days) is nearly equal to the inter-call interval (c. 45 days).  
   – We thus use the historic inter-call interval as our base rate, without factoring in Trump’s domestic distractions or Putin’s other priorities, for a pure outside-view estimate.  

Outside view calibration:  
   – The Poisson-model base rate suggests ~58%; rounding modestly upward to account for announced intent to stay in touch and the intensifying Ukraine conflict, we center around 60%.  

Outside View Prediction:  
   I estimate a 60% chance that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will speak on the phone with each other between May 12, 2025 and June 15, 2025.

Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
• NBC News (Oct 08 2024) – Reports Woodward’s claim of up to seven post-presidency Trump–Putin calls.  Only the existence of Woodward’s book and the fact that neither side confirmed the allegation are hard facts; everything else (the anonymous aide’s description, Sen. Vance’s commentary) is opinion.  Source quality: mainstream U.S. outlet with standard fact-checking, but the key “seven calls” datum rests on a single unnamed witness → medium reliability for the numeric claim.  
• Reuters (Mar 23 2025) – Confirms two publicly announced 2025 calls (12 Feb, 18 Mar).  Kremlin spokesman Peskov’s remarks and Trump’s quotations are on-record facts; discussion of a November 2024 call is unverified.  Reuters is high-quality; factual components rated high reliability.  
• Russia Matters (Mar 25 2025) – Think-tank analysis of the 18 Mar readouts.  Factual elements = call length, the two official read-outs; interpretation of “strategic gap” is expert opinion by regional specialists (moderately weightable).  
• ABC News (undated 2025) – Combines White House and Kremlin statements (facts) with reactions by named ministers (facts) and commentary by analysts (opinion).  Main factual addition: this was the first U.S.–Russia presidential call in three years.  Source quality: high for basic facts.  
• The Conversation (Feb 13 2025) – Editor’s briefing quoting named European officials and summarising Western press.  Facts: identifiable quotes, market reaction; opinions are clearly marked.  Academic-media hybrid → medium/high reliability.  
• Al Jazeera (Mar 19 2025) – Lays out the mutually acknowledged 30-day pause on energy-infrastructure strikes and lists Kremlin conditions.  Facts: existence of the call and stated concessions.  Opinions by Keir Giles and other analysts are expert commentary.  High reliability for the basic chronology.  
• Perplexity report – Collates open-source timelines.  Gives correct dates for publicly confirmed calls; introduces earlier 2017–20 call list and notes Woodward’s allegations.  Secondary compilation, so I treat it as a pointer back to primary press coverage; factual elements already cross-checked above.

(b)  Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “Phone-call frequency between U.S. and Russian (or Soviet) leaders during normal bilateral relations.”  Typical long-run average ≈ 3-5 calls a year → 0.3 – 0.4 calls / month.  
2. “Frequency when the two leaders are actively driving a major negotiation (arms-control, Syria 2015–16, Ukraine 2025).”  Historically rises to 6 – 12 calls a year → 0.5 – 1.0 calls / month.  
3. “Trump–Putin personal pattern.”  In Trump’s first term (2017–20) we saw 5 public calls in 2017, 5 in 2018, 2–3 each in 2019–20 → average ≈ 0.45 calls / month.  2025 to date: 2 calls in ~3 months → 0.65 calls / month.

Given the current, intensifying U.S.–Russia channel on Ukraine and the obvious personal rapport, class 2 (active bilateral negotiation) matches best.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
• Days until the window opens: 6 (May 06 → May 12).  Days until it closes: 40 (May 06 → Jun 15), but only 34 days actually count (May 12–Jun 14 inclusive).  
• Under Poisson approximation with λ = monthly-call-rate × 1.13 months.  
  – Using generic peacetime rate 0.4 → λ ≈ 0.45  ⇒ P(≥1) ≈ 1 – e^–0.45 ≈ 36 %.  
  – Using “active negotiation” rate 0.75 → λ ≈ 0.85 ⇒ P(≥1) ≈ 57 %.  
  – Using 2025 empirical rate 0.65 → λ ≈ 0.74 ⇒ P(≥1) ≈ 52 %.

Historical pattern: Trump and Putin have already averaged one call every 41 days this year (12 Feb → 18 Mar gap = 34 days; 18 Mar → today gap = 49 days without a public call).  A 34-day gap would fit perfectly within that cadence.

(d)  Justification  
• Number of prior calls is the single strongest base-rate driver; two calls within the first quarter of 2025 imply an elevated ongoing cadence.  
• Both governments publicly state that “contacts will continue as necessary,” signalling that further calls are not unusual, but nothing specific (that would be “inside view”) commits them to do it by mid-June.  
• Calls tend to be clustered around concrete negotiation milestones (cease-fire renewals, prisoner swaps, summit preparation).  No formally scheduled milestone has been announced for the next 34 days, so I do not boost probability beyond the historical cadence rate.  
• Market or expert expectations: no prediction market price is available; pundit commentary is split.  I therefore keep the outside view purely frequency-based.  
Combining the three Poisson estimates, I take a weighted mean tilted toward the “active negotiation” class (60 %) and the empirical 2025 rate (40 %):  
P = 0.6 × 57 % + 0.4 × 52 % = 55 %.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: 55 % chance of one or more calls in any 34-day period given the current call rate.  
• Adjustment for small sample noise (only two observed 2025 calls) → subtract 3 %.  
• Bayesian conservative shrink toward 50 % (uninformative prior) → subtract another 1 %.  
Final outside-view probability ≈ 51 %.

Outside View Prediction:
51 %
Error extracting probability: Could not extract prediction from response: Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Reuters/Yahoo (5 May 2025) – Straight news wire; quotes Kremlin spox Peskov and WH aides; confirms “several” Trump-Putin calls in 2025 and that a summit is being discussed but not fixed.  High-quality facts, minimal opinion.  
• CNN (18 Mar 2025) – Mixed report/analysis.  Hard facts: 30-day energy-infrastructure pause, prisoner swap, call length.  Opinions are author commentary.  Reliable for chronology.  
• Kyiv Independent (4 May 2025) – Interview excerpts with Trump on NBC.  Facts: Trump claims EU leaders urged him to phone Putin; no deal after self-imposed 100-day deadline.  Moderate reliability; quotes verifiable.  
• The Atlantic (29 Apr 2025) – Long-form opinion by Robert Kagan.  Factual scaffold (number of calls, lack of concessions) is documented; main thrust is commentary.  Use only the factual timeline.  
• Vox, Al Jazeera (Mar 2025) – Both give factual call details and Ukrainian reaction; opinions clearly separated; outlets mainstream.  
• AskNews Italian/Arabic/Russian wires (5 May 2025) – Direct Peskov quotes on need for summit, “no specifics yet.”  All cite same Kremlin briefing; multiple independent outlets, high factual confidence.  
 Overall: all hard facts come from official read-outs or on-record statements; opinions considered only when attributable to named experts (e.g., Lavrov, U.S. senators, think-tank analysts).

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical frequency: two acknowledged leader calls (12 Feb & 18 Mar) in Trump’s first 80 days back in office.  (Reuters, WH read-outs)  
• Public statements by Peskov & Trump that further contacts are “ongoing” and a summit is being prepared.  (Reuters + multiple wires)  
Moderate evidence  
• Pattern during active negotiations (e.g., Obama-Putin over Syria 2015, Bush-Putin 2001) ≈ 6–12 calls/yr → 0.5–1.0 calls/mo.  
• Trump failed to meet 100-day peace pledge → political incentive for visible activity (phone calls cheaper than concessions).  
Weak evidence  
• Rumours of Saudi face-to-face meeting (denied); could replace a phone call.  
• Speculation that Putin may ignore Trump to pressure him.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution window: 12 May – 14 Jun 2025 (34 days ≈ 1.13 months).  
If the window were halved to 17 days, probability would fall roughly one-third (to mid-40 %).  If doubled to 68 days, probability would rise to mid-70 %.  Sensitivity stems almost linearly from assumed Poisson call rate.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base-rate (Poisson, 0.6 calls/mo) → 52 % chance.  
Inside-view upward pressures  
+ “Several” calls already in 2025 implies realised rate ≈ 1.0 call/mo → raw Poisson P(≥1 in 34 days)=67 %.  
+ Both sides explicitly preparing a summit; leader-level calls are a standard preparatory step.  
+ Cease-fire pause collapsed mid-April; a review call before next NATO summit (early July) is plausible.  
Counter-pressures  
– Possibility that the next interaction is an in-person meeting rather than a phone call.  
– Domestic optics: Trump criticised as “taken for a ride”; staff may slow leader-level contact for a few weeks.  
– Requirement that BOTH sides acknowledge the call (concealed calls would not count).

Net: start at 52 %, add ~12 pp for higher measured rate, subtract 5 pp for counter-pressures/acknowledgement risk ⇒ 59 %.

Probability calibration:
“I expect that about 59 times out of 100, a publicly acknowledged Trump–Putin phone call will occur between 12 May and 14 Jun 2025.”

Checklist:
1  Title paraphrase: “Will Trump & Putin hold a phone call between 12 May and 15 Jun 2025 (both must admit)?”  
2  Outside view: 51–52 %.  
3  Consistency line written above.  
4  Key evidence: a) two confirmed calls in first quarter; b) Peskov & Trump say contacts ongoing & summit needed; c) historical active-negotiation rate ≈ 1/mo; d) political need for new visible step before NATO meeting.  
5  Blind-spot: Parties secretly downgrade to staff-level talks; next leader contact is a June in-person summit without prior call – would drop true odds sharply.  
6  Status quo: cadence so far already supports one call every ~40 d; status quo is “call happens.”

Probability: 59 %

   - Summary: Trump claims EU leaders requested his intervention; Kremlin says meeting "necessary"
   - Quality: Varied (includes Russian state media, European and Ukrainian sources)
   - Key facts: Kremlin confirms no meeting plans in Saudi Arabia; Trump scheduled to visit Gulf May 13-16

(b) Evidence Analysis:

Strong evidence:
- Multiple confirmed Trump-Putin phone calls in 2025 establish pattern of direct leader communication (Reuters)
- Kremlin's explicit statement that a Trump-Putin meeting is "necessary" signals active diplomatic channel (multiple sources)
- March 18 call established specific agreements requiring monitoring and follow-up (CNN, Vox, Al Jazeera)

Moderate evidence:
- Implementation issues with limited ceasefire would typically prompt follow-up communication (Al Jazeera)
- Trump self-positioning as primary Putin channel ("EU leaders asked me to call Putin") suggests continued communication (multiple sources)
- Trump's stated belief they're "fairly close" to peace deal implies ongoing communication (Kyiv Independent)

Weak evidence:
- Discussions about potential face-to-face meeting could either replace or necessitate preparatory calls
- Trump's Gulf trip May 13-16 creates potential diplomatic timing opportunity
- Expired 100-day peace deadline could either intensify or reduce communication efforts

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is 40 days (May 6 - June 15, 2025). Key timing considerations:
- Reuters confirms "several" Trump-Putin calls in 2025 (at least 3 in ~4 months), suggesting approximately one call every 30-40 days
- Last confirmed call was March 18, approximately 49 days ago, exceeding the typical interval
- The 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire negotiated on March 18 would have expired in mid-April

If the timeframe were halved to 20 days, probability would decrease modestly to ~65-70%, as there would be less time for diplomatic necessities to prompt a call, but we'd still be well beyond the typical interval.

If doubled to 80 days, probability would increase significantly to ~90-95%, as it would cover at least two expected call intervals based on established patterns.

(d) Justification:

The strongest factors supporting a high probability:

1. Established communication pattern - "Several" calls in 2025 indicates regular leader-level engagement with an approximate 30-40 day cadence; we're already 49 days past the last confirmed call

2. Active diplomatic process - Multiple sources confirm ongoing US-Russia engagement on Ukraine with Trump personally mediating; Kremlin explicitly called a meeting "necessary" but requiring preparation

3. Follow-up imperative - The limited 30-day ceasefire agreement from March 18 has expired with reported implementation challenges, creating a clear rationale for follow-up communication

4. Trump's personal diplomacy approach - Consistently demonstrates preference for direct leader-to-leader engagement, bypassing traditional diplomatic channels

5. Potential meeting preparations - Talk of a potential face-to-face meeting would normally involve preliminary phone calls to establish agenda and parameters

Potential counterarguments include a shift to lower-level diplomatic channels, Trump abandoning mediation efforts after missing his deadline, or plans for an in-person meeting eliminating the need for a call. However, these scenarios seem less likely given the established pattern and Trump's consistent diplomatic approach.

Probability calibration:

Starting with the established frequency of calls (approximately every 30-40 days), with the last call 49 days ago, we're already overdue based on the pattern. The 40-day prediction window would typically capture about one expected call.

Given:
- We're already beyond the typical interval between calls
- Active diplomatic channels confirmed by multiple sources
- Expired ceasefire agreement creating follow-up imperative
- Trump's consistent direct leader engagement approach
- Potential face-to-face meeting preparations

I believe the probability is approximately 80% that Trump and Putin will speak by phone before June 15, 2025.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Putin have a mutually acknowledged phone conversation between May 6-June 15, 2025?
2. Outside view: ~30-40 day interval between calls in 2025; last call 49 days ago (March 18)
3. Consistency: "80 of 100 times, Trump and Putin would speak by phone during this 40-day window"
4. Key evidence: 1) Multiple 2025 calls establish pattern 2) 49 days since last call exceeds typical interval 3) Expired ceasefire requires follow-up 4) Kremlin confirms "necessary" engagement
5. Blind-spot: Trump privately abandoning mediation efforts without public announcement 
6. Status quo: Ongoing diplomatic engagement with regular leader communication continues

Probability: 80%
Predicted Probability: 80.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis
1. **Yahoo News/Reuters (May 5, 2025)**: High-quality reporting stating Putin and Trump have "spoken by phone several times so far in 2025." Confirms Trump's upcoming Gulf trip and Putin having no Middle East trips planned. Peskov's statement about a meeting being "necessary" represents Kremlin's position.

2. **CNN (March 18, 2025)**: Reputable source detailing a specific Trump-Putin call that led to limited agreements on prisoner swaps and energy infrastructure. Contains opinion elements about Trump being "bluffed" but core facts about call outcomes appear reliable.

3. **Kyiv Independent (May 4, 2025)**: Ukrainian source reporting Trump's NBC interview where he claimed EU leaders asked him to call Putin "many times." Factually notes Trump's 100-day peace deadline passed without agreement.

4. **The Atlantic (April 29, 2025)**: Opinion piece by Robert Kagan. Contains factual elements about Trump negotiating directly with Putin for three months without securing substantive concessions, but primarily offers analysis.

5. **Vox (March 18, 2025)**: Confirms the same March 18 call, noting Putin declined a full ceasefire but backed a limited 30-day pause.

6. **Al Jazeera (March 19, 2025)**: Provides expert analysis from named analysts regarding Ukrainian reactions and strategic implications of the March call.

7. **AskNews articles (May 2025)**: Multiple international sources confirming Trump's EU claims, Kremlin's interest in dialogue, Trump's May 13-16 Middle East trip, and verification that Trump-Putin have spoken "several times" in 2025.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **Established communication pattern**: Multiple reliable sources confirm Trump and Putin have spoken "several times" by phone in 2025 (Reuters, multiple corroborating sources).
- **Active Ukraine peace mediation**: Trump continues to position himself as the key mediator in resolving the Ukraine conflict, creating ongoing diplomatic needs for communication (multiple sources).

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Trump's upcoming Middle East trip (May 13-16)**: Creates a natural juncture for pre-trip or post-trip coordination (Reuters, AskNews).
- **Kremlin's expressed interest in dialogue**: Peskov calling meeting "necessary" indicates Russian receptiveness to continued communication (Reuters, AskNews).
- **Trump's self-positioning as EU's channel to Putin**: Creates political incentive to maintain this role through continued communication (Kyiv Independent, AskNews).

**Weak evidence:**
- **Expiration of Trump's 100-day peace deadline**: Could either increase urgency or signal a pause in intensive diplomacy.
- **Russia's conditional negotiation stance**: May influence call timing but effect is speculative.
- **Past calls' limited success**: The limited results from previous calls might affect frequency, but impact is unclear.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis
The prediction window spans 34 days (May 12-June 15, 2025). 

If this window were halved (17 days), probability would decrease by ~10-15% as there would be less time for diplomatic circumstances to necessitate a call.

If doubled (68 days), probability would increase by ~15-20%, as it would encompass more potential diplomatic events and a longer natural cycle of communication.

The timing aligns with:
1. Trump's Middle East trip (May 13-16)
2. Possible expiration of the 30-day pause on energy infrastructure attacks
3. Roughly one month of regular diplomatic activity, which appears to be the approximate cadence of Trump-Putin calls in 2025

## (d) Justification
To estimate the base rate, I note:
- "Several times" in 2025 (per Reuters) likely means at least 3-4 calls over ~4 months
- This suggests approximately 0.75-1 calls per month
- For a 34-day window (~1.1 months), a Poisson model with λ=0.85 gives P(≥1 call) = 1-e^(-0.85) ≈ 57%

Factors supporting likelihood of a call:
1. The established pattern of "several" calls already in 2025 demonstrates ongoing communication
2. Trump's active Ukraine mediation continues, requiring leader-level dialogue
3. The Middle East trip (May 13-16) creates a natural diplomatic context for coordination
4. Trump's public positioning as the EU's channel to Putin creates pressure to maintain this role

Factors decreasing likelihood:
1. Possible diplomatic fatigue after intensive February-March negotiations
2. Potential focus on preparing for a face-to-face meeting instead of another call
3. No specific crisis currently visible that would necessitate an urgent call

## Probability calibration
Starting with the base rate of 57% from the Poisson model:

**Upward adjustments:**
- Trump's Middle East trip creates natural diplomatic context (+5%)
- Continuing Ukraine mediation requires leader communication (+4%)
- Trump's self-positioning as EU's channel to Putin (+2%)

**Downward adjustments:**
- Possible diplomatic fatigue after earlier intensive negotiations (-3%)
- Potential focus on planning a face-to-face meeting instead (-4%)
- No specific crisis requiring urgent communication (-2%)

Net adjustment: +2%, yielding 59% probability

## Checklist:
1. Will Trump and Putin speak on phone between May 12-June 15, 2025 with both sides acknowledging the call?
2. Outside view based on 2025 call pattern: ~57% chance of a call in this window
3. 59 times out of 100, Trump and Putin would speak by phone during this period.
4. Key evidence: Established "several" calls in 2025; Trump's Mid-East trip creates diplomatic juncture; Active Ukraine mediation continues; Both leaders signal interest in continued dialogue
5. Blind spot: An already-scheduled but unannounced face-to-face meeting could eliminate need for call.
6. Status quo slightly favors a call occurring based on roughly monthly cadence established in 2025.

Probability: 59%
Predicted Probability: 59.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Reuters/Yahoo (May 5): High-quality Reuters report. Confirms Trump–Putin phone calls “several times so far in 2025” and Kremlin’s Peskov saying a meeting/call is “necessary” but “no specifics.” Factual.  
2. CNN (Mar 18): Reliable U.S. outlet. Describes the March 18 call, terms of the energy-infrastructure pause, and Kremlin/White House readouts. Factual reporting with expert commentary flagged as opinion.  
3. Kyiv Independent (May 4): Reputable regional outlet. Reports Trump’s claim EU leaders asked him to call Putin. Contains Trump’s statements (factual as quotes) and context on European leaders (factual).  
4. The Atlantic (Apr 29): Opinion/analysis piece. Argues Trump’s Ukraine negotiations have failed. Useful for understanding incentives but largely interpretative.  
5. Vox (Mar 18): Factual summary of the March 18 call and its limited outcomes. Opinions are clearly attributed to expert analysts.  
6. Al Jazeera (Mar 19): Reliable. Summarizes Ukrainian reactions to the Feb call and expert warnings. Factual reporting mixed with sourced analysis.

Asknews articles: A large collection of primarily May 4–5 reports, many repeating Trump’s EU-leaders claim and Kremlin’s “necessary” but “no details” position. Quality varies, but core facts–Trump’s public comments and Peskov’s statements–are consistent across outlets.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
- Two confirmed 2025 calls (Feb 12, Mar 18) by Reuters, CNN, Vox.  
- Peskov’s repeated statements that calls/meeting are “necessary” and future contacts are expected.  
- Historical pattern in 2025: ~1 call every 5–7 weeks.  

Moderate evidence:  
- Trump’s political incentive to burnish his peacemaker image (Kyiv Independent, Atlantic).  
- Need to follow up on the March energy-infrastructure pause.  

Weak evidence:  
- Speculative rumors of meeting during Putin’s Victory Day events (Notizie.it).  
- Unverified EU-leaders request anecdote (Trump quote unconfirmed by EU).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window: 34 days (May 12–June 15). At ~7-week call frequency, next call centers around May 27 (mid-window).  
– If window halved (~17 days), probability declines from ~72% to ~55%.  
– If window doubled (~68 days), probability rises to ~88%.  

(d) Justification  
Base rate: Two calls in 3.5 months → ~57% per 3.5-month span. Adjust for our 34-day (1.1-month) window: (1.1/3.5)*57% ≈18%. But calls often cluster around agreement milestones. The March 30-day pause expires mid-April; assessing/renewing it would drive a follow-up in late May. Peskov’s explicit “continue contacts as necessary” is a structural factor. Trump also publicly markets himself as unique interlocutor—another incentive. Offsetting factors: possible shift to envoys/in-person meetings in Saudi Arabia (May 13–16), reducing pure phone motives. Net adjustment: +54 points for strong institutional momentum and conflict urgency, −10 for alternative channels → ~62%. Slight hedging for unpredictable diplomacy → final 72%.

Probability calibration  
I started with the 2025 call frequency (base ~18% per month) and scaled to our 1.1-month window. Then I added institutional factors (renewal of pause, Kremlin commitment) and Trump’s incentives for a dramatic outreach. I subtracted for likely parallel diplomatic channels (in-person summit in Gulf). The final estimate reflects my inside view anchored to the outside view baseline and accounts for current news dynamics.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will Trump and Putin speak by phone (both acknowledge) between May 12 and June 15, 2025?”  
2. Base rate: ~2 calls in 3.5 months in 2025; ~57% per quarter.  
3. Consistency: “72 out of 100 times, a phone call occurs in a 34-day window under current dynamics.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   a. Two calls in 2025 (strong historical pattern)  
   b. Peskov’s forward-looking statements (structural factor)  
   c. March pause follow-up necessity (causal mechanism)  
   d. Trump’s political incentive (moderate factor)  
5. Blind-spot: A secret in-person summit in Saudi Arabia supplants a phone call, making no call public. Could reduce actual calls by half.  
6. Status quo: Diplomatic communications have been regular in 2025; no major shocks announced → favors continuation.

Predicted Probability: 72.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Reuters (May 5 2025): Reports Kremlin’s Peskov calling a Trump–Putin summit “necessary” but offering no specifics. High credibility, named spokespeople, current.

For each, factual vs. opinion: prioritize named spokespeople (Peskov, Trump on record) and actual readouts (call dates, agendas). Discount anonymous or highly interpretive commentary when weighing call likelihood.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (+large shift):  
 • Historical call cadence in 2025: two confirmed calls over ~90 days → ~1 per 45 days (Reuters, CNN).  
 • Both Kremlin and White House publicly endorse continued high-level contacts (Reuters, Asknews).  

Moderate evidence (+moderate shift):  
 • Trump repeatedly states EU leaders asked him to call Putin (Kyiv Independent); indicates extra diplomatic impetus.  
 • Ukraine war remains highly active, giving both sides motive for direct engagement (Atlantic, Al Jazeera).  

Weak evidence (small adjustments):  
 • Trump’s Middle East trip may divert attention (Reuters note on travel plans).  
 • No scheduled meeting venues or firm dates → uncertainty remains (Asknews).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 39 days (May 12 – June 15, 2025).  
– If window were halved (~19 days), Poisson-model P ≈1–e^(–0.43)≈35%.  
– If doubled (~78 days), P ≈1–e^(–1.74)≈82%.  

(d) Justification  
Outside view base rate: call cadence suggests ~58% chance of ≥1 call in 39 days (λ=39/45).  
Key shifts:  
• Strong institutional signals (Peskov’s “necessary,” Trump’s public outreach) tilt toward maintaining cadence (+ moderate).  
• No major political or logistical barrier has emerged; war in Ukraine remains central and unresolved.  
• Trump’s foreign travel may slightly detract but not enough to offset sustainment of call rhythm.  

Net adjustment: from 58% to ~63% to reflect sustained mutual interest beyond passive cadence.

Probability calibration  
Outside-view base rate (Poisson λ≈0.87): ~58%  
Adjustments: +5% (public endorsements, war-driven urgency) → 63%

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Putin speak by phone between May 12 and June 15, 2025?  
2. Base rate: two calls/90 days → ~1 per 45 days → 58% over 39 days.  
3. Consistency: “63 out of 100 times, this call happens in the window.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 2025 call cadence (strong).  
   • Kremlin’s public “necessary” statement (strong).  
   • Trump’s claims of EU pressure to call (moderate).  
   • Active Ukraine war providing agenda (moderate).  
5. Blind spot: Sudden geopolitical flare-up (e.g., a breakdown in talks or a major distraction like a Middle East crisis) stops any further calls.  
6. Status quo: Calls every ~6–7 weeks amid active diplomacy.  

Probability: 63%
Predicted Probability: 63.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Reuters/Yahoo (5 May 2025) – Straight news wire; quotes Kremlin spox Peskov and WH aides; confirms “several” Trump-Putin calls in 2025 and that a summit is being discussed but not fixed.  High-quality facts, minimal opinion.  
• CNN (18 Mar 2025) – Mixed report/analysis.  Hard facts: 30-day energy-infrastructure pause, prisoner swap, call length.  Opinions are author commentary.  Reliable for chronology.  
• Kyiv Independent (4 May 2025) – Interview excerpts with Trump on NBC.  Facts: Trump claims EU leaders urged him to phone Putin; no deal after self-imposed 100-day deadline.  Moderate reliability; quotes verifiable.  
• The Atlantic (29 Apr 2025) – Long-form opinion by Robert Kagan.  Factual scaffold (number of calls, lack of concessions) is documented; main thrust is commentary.  Use only the factual timeline.  
• Vox, Al Jazeera (Mar 2025) – Both give factual call details and Ukrainian reaction; opinions clearly separated; outlets mainstream.  
• AskNews Italian/Arabic/Russian wires (5 May 2025) – Direct Peskov quotes on need for summit, “no specifics yet.”  All cite same Kremlin briefing; multiple independent outlets, high factual confidence.  
 Overall: all hard facts come from official read-outs or on-record statements; opinions considered only when attributable to named experts (e.g., Lavrov, U.S. senators, think-tank analysts).

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical frequency: two acknowledged leader calls (12 Feb & 18 Mar) in Trump’s first 80 days back in office.  (Reuters, WH read-outs)  
• Public statements by Peskov & Trump that further contacts are “ongoing” and a summit is being prepared.  (Reuters + multiple wires)  
Moderate evidence  
• Pattern during active negotiations (e.g., Obama-Putin over Syria 2015, Bush-Putin 2001) ≈ 6–12 calls/yr → 0.5–1.0 calls/mo.  
• Trump failed to meet 100-day peace pledge → political incentive for visible activity (phone calls cheaper than concessions).  
Weak evidence  
• Rumours of Saudi face-to-face meeting (denied); could replace a phone call.  
• Speculation that Putin may ignore Trump to pressure him.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution window: 12 May – 14 Jun 2025 (34 days ≈ 1.13 months).  
If the window were halved to 17 days, probability would fall roughly one-third (to mid-40 %).  If doubled to 68 days, probability would rise to mid-70 %.  Sensitivity stems almost linearly from assumed Poisson call rate.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base-rate (Poisson, 0.6 calls/mo) → 52 % chance.  
Inside-view upward pressures  
+ “Several” calls already in 2025 implies realised rate ≈ 1.0 call/mo → raw Poisson P(≥1 in 34 days)=67 %.  
+ Both sides explicitly preparing a summit; leader-level calls are a standard preparatory step.  
+ Cease-fire pause collapsed mid-April; a review call before next NATO summit (early July) is plausible.  
Counter-pressures  
– Possibility that the next interaction is an in-person meeting rather than a phone call.  
– Domestic optics: Trump criticised as “taken for a ride”; staff may slow leader-level contact for a few weeks.  
– Requirement that BOTH sides acknowledge the call (concealed calls would not count).

Net: start at 52 %, add ~12 pp for higher measured rate, subtract 5 pp for counter-pressures/acknowledgement risk ⇒ 59 %.

Probability calibration:
“I expect that about 59 times out of 100, a publicly acknowledged Trump–Putin phone call will occur between 12 May and 14 Jun 2025.”

Checklist:
1  Title paraphrase: “Will Trump & Putin hold a phone call between 12 May and 15 Jun 2025 (both must admit)?”  
2  Outside view: 51–52 %.  
3  Consistency line written above.  
4  Key evidence: a) two confirmed calls in first quarter; b) Peskov & Trump say contacts ongoing & summit needed; c) historical active-negotiation rate ≈ 1/mo; d) political need for new visible step before NATO meeting.  
5  Blind-spot: Parties secretly downgrade to staff-level talks; next leader contact is a June in-person summit without prior call – would drop true odds sharply.  
6  Status quo: cadence so far already supports one call every ~40 d; status quo is “call happens.”

Probability: 59 %
Predicted Probability: N/A%

   - Summary: Ukrainian reactions to Trump-Putin negotiations
   - Quality: Reputable international news organization

7. Multiple Asknews articles (May 4-5, 2025)
   - Summary: Trump claims EU leaders requested his intervention; Kremlin says meeting "necessary"
   - Quality: Varied (includes Russian state media, European and Ukrainian sources)
   - Key facts: Kremlin confirms no meeting plans in Saudi Arabia; Trump scheduled to visit Gulf May 13-16

(b) Evidence Analysis:

Strong evidence:
- Multiple confirmed Trump-Putin phone calls in 2025 establish pattern of direct leader communication (Reuters)
- Kremlin's explicit statement that a Trump-Putin meeting is "necessary" signals active diplomatic channel (multiple sources)
- March 18 call established specific agreements requiring monitoring and follow-up (CNN, Vox, Al Jazeera)

Moderate evidence:
- Implementation issues with limited ceasefire would typically prompt follow-up communication (Al Jazeera)
- Trump self-positioning as primary Putin channel ("EU leaders asked me to call Putin") suggests continued communication (multiple sources)
- Trump's stated belief they're "fairly close" to peace deal implies ongoing communication (Kyiv Independent)

Weak evidence:
- Discussions about potential face-to-face meeting could either replace or necessitate preparatory calls
- Trump's Gulf trip May 13-16 creates potential diplomatic timing opportunity
- Expired 100-day peace deadline could either intensify or reduce communication efforts

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is 40 days (May 6 - June 15, 2025). Key timing considerations:
- Reuters confirms "several" Trump-Putin calls in 2025 (at least 3 in ~4 months), suggesting approximately one call every 30-40 days
- Last confirmed call was March 18, approximately 49 days ago, exceeding the typical interval
- The 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire negotiated on March 18 would have expired in mid-April

If the timeframe were halved to 20 days, probability would decrease modestly to ~65-70%, as there would be less time for diplomatic necessities to prompt a call, but we'd still be well beyond the typical interval.

If doubled to 80 days, probability would increase significantly to ~90-95%, as it would cover at least two expected call intervals based on established patterns.

(d) Justification:

The strongest factors supporting a high probability:

1. Established communication pattern - "Several" calls in 2025 indicates regular leader-level engagement with an approximate 30-40 day cadence; we're already 49 days past the last confirmed call

2. Active diplomatic process - Multiple sources confirm ongoing US-Russia engagement on Ukraine with Trump personally mediating; Kremlin explicitly called a meeting "necessary" but requiring preparation

3. Follow-up imperative - The limited 30-day ceasefire agreement from March 18 has expired with reported implementation challenges, creating a clear rationale for follow-up communication

4. Trump's personal diplomacy approach - Consistently demonstrates preference for direct leader-to-leader engagement, bypassing traditional diplomatic channels

5. Potential meeting preparations - Talk of a potential face-to-face meeting would normally involve preliminary phone calls to establish agenda and parameters

Potential counterarguments include a shift to lower-level diplomatic channels, Trump abandoning mediation efforts after missing his deadline, or plans for an in-person meeting eliminating the need for a call. However, these scenarios seem less likely given the established pattern and Trump's consistent diplomatic approach.

Probability calibration:

Starting with the established frequency of calls (approximately every 30-40 days), with the last call 49 days ago, we're already overdue based on the pattern. The 40-day prediction window would typically capture about one expected call.

Given:
- We're already beyond the typical interval between calls
- Active diplomatic channels confirmed by multiple sources
- Expired ceasefire agreement creating follow-up imperative
- Trump's consistent direct leader engagement approach
- Potential face-to-face meeting preparations

I believe the probability is approximately 80% that Trump and Putin will speak by phone before June 15, 2025.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Putin have a mutually acknowledged phone conversation between May 6-June 15, 2025?
2. Outside view: ~30-40 day interval between calls in 2025; last call 49 days ago (March 18)
3. Consistency: "80 of 100 times, Trump and Putin would speak by phone during this 40-day window"
4. Key evidence: 1) Multiple 2025 calls establish pattern 2) 49 days since last call exceeds typical interval 3) Expired ceasefire requires follow-up 4) Kremlin confirms "necessary" engagement
5. Blind-spot: Trump privately abandoning mediation efforts without public announcement 
6. Status quo: Ongoing diplomatic engagement with regular leader communication continues

Probability: 80%
Predicted Probability: 80.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis
1. **Yahoo News/Reuters (May 5, 2025)**: High-quality reporting stating Putin and Trump have "spoken by phone several times so far in 2025." Confirms Trump's upcoming Gulf trip and Putin having no Middle East trips planned. Peskov's statement about a meeting being "necessary" represents Kremlin's position.

2. **CNN (March 18, 2025)**: Reputable source detailing a specific Trump-Putin call that led to limited agreements on prisoner swaps and energy infrastructure. Contains opinion elements about Trump being "bluffed" but core facts about call outcomes appear reliable.

3. **Kyiv Independent (May 4, 2025)**: Ukrainian source reporting Trump's NBC interview where he claimed EU leaders asked him to call Putin "many times." Factually notes Trump's 100-day peace deadline passed without agreement.

4. **The Atlantic (April 29, 2025)**: Opinion piece by Robert Kagan. Contains factual elements about Trump negotiating directly with Putin for three months without securing substantive concessions, but primarily offers analysis.

5. **Vox (March 18, 2025)**: Confirms the same March 18 call, noting Putin declined a full ceasefire but backed a limited 30-day pause.

6. **Al Jazeera (March 19, 2025)**: Provides expert analysis from named analysts regarding Ukrainian reactions and strategic implications of the March call.

7. **AskNews articles (May 2025)**: Multiple international sources confirming Trump's EU claims, Kremlin's interest in dialogue, Trump's May 13-16 Middle East trip, and verification that Trump-Putin have spoken "several times" in 2025.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **Established communication pattern**: Multiple reliable sources confirm Trump and Putin have spoken "several times" by phone in 2025 (Reuters, multiple corroborating sources).
- **Active Ukraine peace mediation**: Trump continues to position himself as the key mediator in resolving the Ukraine conflict, creating ongoing diplomatic needs for communication (multiple sources).

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Trump's upcoming Middle East trip (May 13-16)**: Creates a natural juncture for pre-trip or post-trip coordination (Reuters, AskNews).
- **Kremlin's expressed interest in dialogue**: Peskov calling meeting "necessary" indicates Russian receptiveness to continued communication (Reuters, AskNews).
- **Trump's self-positioning as EU's channel to Putin**: Creates political incentive to maintain this role through continued communication (Kyiv Independent, AskNews).

**Weak evidence:**
- **Expiration of Trump's 100-day peace deadline**: Could either increase urgency or signal a pause in intensive diplomacy.
- **Russia's conditional negotiation stance**: May influence call timing but effect is speculative.
- **Past calls' limited success**: The limited results from previous calls might affect frequency, but impact is unclear.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis
The prediction window spans 34 days (May 12-June 15, 2025). 

If this window were halved (17 days), probability would decrease by ~10-15% as there would be less time for diplomatic circumstances to necessitate a call.

If doubled (68 days), probability would increase by ~15-20%, as it would encompass more potential diplomatic events and a longer natural cycle of communication.

The timing aligns with:
1. Trump's Middle East trip (May 13-16)
2. Possible expiration of the 30-day pause on energy infrastructure attacks
3. Roughly one month of regular diplomatic activity, which appears to be the approximate cadence of Trump-Putin calls in 2025

## (d) Justification
To estimate the base rate, I note:
- "Several times" in 2025 (per Reuters) likely means at least 3-4 calls over ~4 months
- This suggests approximately 0.75-1 calls per month
- For a 34-day window (~1.1 months), a Poisson model with λ=0.85 gives P(≥1 call) = 1-e^(-0.85) ≈ 57%

Factors supporting likelihood of a call:
1. The established pattern of "several" calls already in 2025 demonstrates ongoing communication
2. Trump's active Ukraine mediation continues, requiring leader-level dialogue
3. The Middle East trip (May 13-16) creates a natural diplomatic context for coordination
4. Trump's public positioning as the EU's channel to Putin creates pressure to maintain this role

Factors decreasing likelihood:
1. Possible diplomatic fatigue after intensive February-March negotiations
2. Potential focus on preparing for a face-to-face meeting instead of another call
3. No specific crisis currently visible that would necessitate an urgent call

## Probability calibration
Starting with the base rate of 57% from the Poisson model:

**Upward adjustments:**
- Trump's Middle East trip creates natural diplomatic context (+5%)
- Continuing Ukraine mediation requires leader communication (+4%)
- Trump's self-positioning as EU's channel to Putin (+2%)

**Downward adjustments:**
- Possible diplomatic fatigue after earlier intensive negotiations (-3%)
- Potential focus on planning a face-to-face meeting instead (-4%)
- No specific crisis requiring urgent communication (-2%)

Net adjustment: +2%, yielding 59% probability

## Checklist:
1. Will Trump and Putin speak on phone between May 12-June 15, 2025 with both sides acknowledging the call?
2. Outside view based on 2025 call pattern: ~57% chance of a call in this window
3. 59 times out of 100, Trump and Putin would speak by phone during this period.
4. Key evidence: Established "several" calls in 2025; Trump's Mid-East trip creates diplomatic juncture; Active Ukraine mediation continues; Both leaders signal interest in continued dialogue
5. Blind spot: An already-scheduled but unannounced face-to-face meeting could eliminate need for call.
6. Status quo slightly favors a call occurring based on roughly monthly cadence established in 2025.

Probability: 59%
Predicted Probability: 59.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Reuters/Yahoo (May 5): High-quality Reuters report. Confirms Trump–Putin phone calls “several times so far in 2025” and Kremlin’s Peskov saying a meeting/call is “necessary” but “no specifics.” Factual.  
2. CNN (Mar 18): Reliable U.S. outlet. Describes the March 18 call, terms of the energy-infrastructure pause, and Kremlin/White House readouts. Factual reporting with expert commentary flagged as opinion.  
3. Kyiv Independent (May 4): Reputable regional outlet. Reports Trump’s claim EU leaders asked him to call Putin. Contains Trump’s statements (factual as quotes) and context on European leaders (factual).  
4. The Atlantic (Apr 29): Opinion/analysis piece. Argues Trump’s Ukraine negotiations have failed. Useful for understanding incentives but largely interpretative.  
5. Vox (Mar 18): Factual summary of the March 18 call and its limited outcomes. Opinions are clearly attributed to expert analysts.  
6. Al Jazeera (Mar 19): Reliable. Summarizes Ukrainian reactions to the Feb call and expert warnings. Factual reporting mixed with sourced analysis.

Asknews articles: A large collection of primarily May 4–5 reports, many repeating Trump’s EU-leaders claim and Kremlin’s “necessary” but “no details” position. Quality varies, but core facts–Trump’s public comments and Peskov’s statements–are consistent across outlets.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
- Two confirmed 2025 calls (Feb 12, Mar 18) by Reuters, CNN, Vox.  
- Peskov’s repeated statements that calls/meeting are “necessary” and future contacts are expected.  
- Historical pattern in 2025: ~1 call every 5–7 weeks.  

Moderate evidence:  
- Trump’s political incentive to burnish his peacemaker image (Kyiv Independent, Atlantic).  
- Need to follow up on the March energy-infrastructure pause.  

Weak evidence:  
- Speculative rumors of meeting during Putin’s Victory Day events (Notizie.it).  
- Unverified EU-leaders request anecdote (Trump quote unconfirmed by EU).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window: 34 days (May 12–June 15). At ~7-week call frequency, next call centers around May 27 (mid-window).  
– If window halved (~17 days), probability declines from ~72% to ~55%.  
– If window doubled (~68 days), probability rises to ~88%.  

(d) Justification  
Base rate: Two calls in 3.5 months → ~57% per 3.5-month span. Adjust for our 34-day (1.1-month) window: (1.1/3.5)*57% ≈18%. But calls often cluster around agreement milestones. The March 30-day pause expires mid-April; assessing/renewing it would drive a follow-up in late May. Peskov’s explicit “continue contacts as necessary” is a structural factor. Trump also publicly markets himself as unique interlocutor—another incentive. Offsetting factors: possible shift to envoys/in-person meetings in Saudi Arabia (May 13–16), reducing pure phone motives. Net adjustment: +54 points for strong institutional momentum and conflict urgency, −10 for alternative channels → ~62%. Slight hedging for unpredictable diplomacy → final 72%.

Probability calibration  
I started with the 2025 call frequency (base ~18% per month) and scaled to our 1.1-month window. Then I added institutional factors (renewal of pause, Kremlin commitment) and Trump’s incentives for a dramatic outreach. I subtracted for likely parallel diplomatic channels (in-person summit in Gulf). The final estimate reflects my inside view anchored to the outside view baseline and accounts for current news dynamics.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will Trump and Putin speak by phone (both acknowledge) between May 12 and June 15, 2025?”  
2. Base rate: ~2 calls in 3.5 months in 2025; ~57% per quarter.  
3. Consistency: “72 out of 100 times, a phone call occurs in a 34-day window under current dynamics.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   a. Two calls in 2025 (strong historical pattern)  
   b. Peskov’s forward-looking statements (structural factor)  
   c. March pause follow-up necessity (causal mechanism)  
   d. Trump’s political incentive (moderate factor)  
5. Blind-spot: A secret in-person summit in Saudi Arabia supplants a phone call, making no call public. Could reduce actual calls by half.  
6. Status quo: Diplomatic communications have been regular in 2025; no major shocks announced → favors continuation.

Probability: 72%
Predicted Probability: 72.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Reuters (May 5 2025): Reports Kremlin’s Peskov calling a Trump–Putin summit “necessary” but offering no specifics. High credibility, named spokespeople, current.  
2. CNN (Mar 18 2025): Details the Mar 18 phone call’s narrow outcome on Ukraine ceasefire. Solid sourcing (Kremlin & White House readouts), context on call cadence.  
3. Kyiv Independent (May 4 2025): Quotes Trump saying EU leaders asked him to call Putin and that Putin ignores their calls. Credible interview source (NBC’s Meet the Press), but speculative on EU requests.  
4. The Atlantic (Apr 29 2025): Critical assessment of Trump’s three months of direct talks with Putin, highlighting failure to secure concessions. Expert opinions, but more interpretive.  
5. Vox (Mar 18 2025): Summarizes details of the Mar 18 call and its limited tactical gains. Reliable for readouts but analysis oriented.  
6. Al Jazeera (Mar 19 2025): Surveys Ukrainian expert reactions to the Feb 2025 call, showing disillusionment with Moscow’s tactics. Balanced but focused on fallout rather than likelihood of further calls.  
7. Asknews cluster (May 4–5 2025): Multiple wire-service articles echo Peskov that a meeting is “necessary” with “no specifics,” plus Trump’s emphasis on EU leaders’ appeals. These collectively signal both sides are talking but have not locked in details.  

For each, factual vs. opinion: prioritize named spokespeople (Peskov, Trump on record) and actual readouts (call dates, agendas). Discount anonymous or highly interpretive commentary when weighing call likelihood.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (+large shift):  
 • Historical call cadence in 2025: two confirmed calls over ~90 days → ~1 per 45 days (Reuters, CNN).  
 • Both Kremlin and White House publicly endorse continued high-level contacts (Reuters, Asknews).  

Moderate evidence (+moderate shift):  
 • Trump repeatedly states EU leaders asked him to call Putin (Kyiv Independent); indicates extra diplomatic impetus.  
 • Ukraine war remains highly active, giving both sides motive for direct engagement (Atlantic, Al Jazeera).  

Weak evidence (small adjustments):  
 • Trump’s Middle East trip may divert attention (Reuters note on travel plans).  
 • No scheduled meeting venues or firm dates → uncertainty remains (Asknews).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 39 days (May 12 – June 15, 2025).  
– If window were halved (~19 days), Poisson-model P ≈1–e^(–0.43)≈35%.  
– If doubled (~78 days), P ≈1–e^(–1.74)≈82%.  

(d) Justification  
Outside view base rate: call cadence suggests ~58% chance of ≥1 call in 39 days (λ=39/45).  
Key shifts:  
• Strong institutional signals (Peskov’s “necessary,” Trump’s public outreach) tilt toward maintaining cadence (+ moderate).  
• No major political or logistical barrier has emerged; war in Ukraine remains central and unresolved.  
• Trump’s foreign travel may slightly detract but not enough to offset sustainment of call rhythm.  

Net adjustment: from 58% to ~63% to reflect sustained mutual interest beyond passive cadence.

Probability calibration  
Outside-view base rate (Poisson λ≈0.87): ~58%  
Adjustments: +5% (public endorsements, war-driven urgency) → 63%

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Putin speak by phone between May 12 and June 15, 2025?  
2. Base rate: two calls/90 days → ~1 per 45 days → 58% over 39 days.  
3. Consistency: “63 out of 100 times, this call happens in the window.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 2025 call cadence (strong).  
   • Kremlin’s public “necessary” statement (strong).  
   • Trump’s claims of EU pressure to call (moderate).  
   • Active Ukraine war providing agenda (moderate).  
5. Blind spot: Sudden geopolitical flare-up (e.g., a breakdown in talks or a major distraction like a Middle East crisis) stops any further calls.  
6. Status quo: Calls every ~6–7 weeks amid active diplomacy.

 Overall: all hard facts come from official read-outs or on-record statements; opinions considered only when attributable to named experts (e.g., Lavrov, U.S. senators, think-tank analysts).

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical frequency: two acknowledged leader calls (12 Feb & 18 Mar) in Trump’s first 80 days back in office.  (Reuters, WH read-outs)  
• Public statements by Peskov & Trump that further contacts are “ongoing” and a summit is being prepared.  (Reuters + multiple wires)  
Moderate evidence  
• Pattern during active negotiations (e.g., Obama-Putin over Syria 2015, Bush-Putin 2001) ≈ 6–12 calls/yr → 0.5–1.0 calls/mo.  
• Trump failed to meet 100-day peace pledge → political incentive for visible activity (phone calls cheaper than concessions).  
Weak evidence  
• Rumours of Saudi face-to-face meeting (denied); could replace a phone call.  
• Speculation that Putin may ignore Trump to pressure him.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution window: 12 May – 14 Jun 2025 (34 days ≈ 1.13 months).  
If the window were halved to 17 days, probability would fall roughly one-third (to mid-40 %).  If doubled to 68 days, probability would rise to mid-70 %.  Sensitivity stems almost linearly from assumed Poisson call rate.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base-rate (Poisson, 0.6 calls/mo) → 52 % chance.  
Inside-view upward pressures  
+ “Several” calls already in 2025 implies realised rate ≈ 1.0 call/mo → raw Poisson P(≥1 in 34 days)=67 %.  
+ Both sides explicitly preparing a summit; leader-level calls are a standard preparatory step.  
+ Cease-fire pause collapsed mid-April; a review call before next NATO summit (early July) is plausible.  
Counter-pressures  
– Possibility that the next interaction is an in-person meeting rather than a phone call.  
– Domestic optics: Trump criticised as “taken for a ride”; staff may slow leader-level contact for a few weeks.  
– Requirement that BOTH sides acknowledge the call (concealed calls would not count).

Net: start at 52 %, add ~12 pp for higher measured rate, subtract 5 pp for counter-pressures/acknowledgement risk ⇒ 59 %.

Probability calibration:
“I expect that about 59 times out of 100, a publicly acknowledged Trump–Putin phone call will occur between 12 May and 14 Jun 2025.”

Checklist:
1  Title paraphrase: “Will Trump & Putin hold a phone call between 12 May and 15 Jun 2025 (both must admit)?”  
2  Outside view: 51–52 %.  
3  Consistency line written above.  
4  Key evidence: a) two confirmed calls in first quarter; b) Peskov & Trump say contacts ongoing & summit needed; c) historical active-negotiation rate ≈ 1/mo; d) political need for new visible step before NATO meeting.  
5  Blind-spot: Parties secretly downgrade to staff-level talks; next leader contact is a June in-person summit without prior call – would drop true odds sharply.  
6  Status quo: cadence so far already supports one call every ~40 d; status quo is “call happens.”

Probability: 59 %
Predicted Probability: N/A%...
