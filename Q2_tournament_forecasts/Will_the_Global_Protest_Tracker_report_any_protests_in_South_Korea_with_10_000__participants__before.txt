Analysis:
To build an out-view baseline, I need to know how frequently South Korea has seen protests of 10,000+ participants since around 2010, what issues triggered the largest rallies, and their timing relative to political cycles or major policy shifts (e.g., martial law declarations, elections, labor reforms). I also want up-to-date reporting on protests since late 2024—especially those sparked by the December 2024 martial law declaration—to gauge momentum and public willingness to mobilize at scale under the current administration.

Analysis:
South Korea has seen surges of anti-government and sectoral protests since the martial law declaration in early 2025. To assess whether any demonstrations have reached the 10,000‐participant threshold, I need reports on recent mass events—particularly in Seoul or other major cities—since January 2025. Key information includes turnout estimates, dates, locations, and any official or media counts that would be captured by the Global Protest Tracker. I’ll look for articles that mention participant numbers or describe large-scale mobilizations, as these form the basis for an inside‐view adjustment to our base‐rate prediction.

<Summary source="https://workersliberty.org/story/2017-07-26/south-korea-labour-and-youth-protests">
Here is a summary of the Workers’ Liberty article “South Korea: Labour and youth protests.” 

1. Main events  
- On Saturday 14 November (year unspecified), the largest Seoul demonstration in at least seven years drew an estimated 60,000–130,000 participants.  
  • At least 500 protesters were injured by water cannon, liquified tear gas and pepper spray.  
  • 51 protesters were detained; one farmer, Paek Nam-ki, was left in critical condition.  
  • Police also sprayed demonstrators with blue paint to mark them for later arrest.  
- A follow-up march took place on Saturday 5 December, but in much smaller numbers, despite courts refusing the government’s request for an injunction banning it.  

2. Protest issues  
- Opposition to President Park Geun-hye’s plan to replace privately-published school history textbooks with a single government-issued text (argued by student activists to whitewash Park Chung-hee’s legacy and obscure North Korea’s role).  
- Changes to labour laws seen as favouring chaebol (family-controlled conglomerates) by making it easier to fire workers.  
- Growing youth unemployment and destructive rice imports.  

3. Organizers and leaders  
- The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) led the 14 November rally; its leader Han Sang-gyun:  
  • Described a widening rich-poor gap and chaebol “wallowing in cash” while many workers remain on poorly paid temporary contracts.  
  • Escaped a plainclothes-police attempt to arrest him under a warrant for organising past “illegal protests,” then rejoined the main rally and urged a march on the Blue House.  
- The Korean Peasant League (KPL) planned a banned 10,000-strong rally near City Hall in Jung-gu on 5 December, and said it would go ahead in defiance of police.  

4. Police and government response  
- On 14 November, police raided 12 offices belonging to eight groups, seeking evidence of “orchestrating” the protest (Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency).  
- President Park labelled protesters “terrorist elements” and called for a ban on masks in protests (drawing a comparison to IS).  
- National Assemblyman Lee Wan-yeong (ruling Saenuri Party) defended Seoul’s forceful tactics by pointing to U.S. police use of firearms.  

5. International commentary  
- At a December 2013 raid on KCTU headquarters during a railway strike, hundreds were injured and six senior KCTU leaders arrested.  
- The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) ranked South Korea among the world’s worst countries for worker rights in 2014—alongside China, Cambodia, Nigeria and Bangladesh—citing systematic unfair dismissals, intimidation and violence.  
- After the 14 November protests, both the ITUC and the International Transport Workers’ Federation condemned South Korea’s anti-union behaviour as running “contrary to its obligations to the ILO” and to its OECD accession commitments.  

6. Next steps by protest groups  
- The KCTU warned it would launch a general strike of its 680,000 members if the National Assembly presses ahead with the contested reforms.  
- South Korean lawmakers ratified a free-trade agreement with China on 1 December; the KCTU plans to protest this ratification alongside the same labour and education issues.

Summary of “Student movements in Korea” (Wikipedia):

1. Origins (1919–1945)  
- First major student activism began with the March First Movement of 1919 against Japanese colonial rule, inspired by Wilson’s call for self-determination.  
- Students helped distribute independence manifestos, sparked nationwide protests (Seoul’s Namdaemun Square, Pyongyang, Gwangju, rural areas) and saw over 200 arrests.  
- Shortly afterward, the Gwangju student movement protested discrimination in colonial education, spreading big street demonstrations against Japanese imperialism.

2. April Revolution (1960)  
- After allegedly rigged March 1960 elections under Syngman Rhee, public anger grew—rural poverty and 34.2% urban unemployment fueled discontent.  
- On April 18, around 3,000 Korea University students marched on the National Assembly; next day roughly 50,000 students from 30 colleges and high schools forced past police to central Seoul, demanding fair elections.

3. 1980s resurgence and Marxist influence  
- May 1980’s Gwangju Massacre galvanized student activism around Marxist-inspired revolution.  
- Leaders of this “386 Generation” had experienced decades of repression under the Rhee and Yushin regimes and the National Security Law, which cast dissent as pro-North Korea.  
- Industrialization and strict labor laws drove students into underground reading groups, religious human-rights educational activities, and the clandestine press (e.g., Council for Democratic Press).

4. Factions and major 1987 protests  
- Three main student political camps formed: National Liberation (NL), National Democracy (ND), and People’s Democracy (PD).  
- Together they mobilized two landmark events:  
  • Great June Democratic Struggle (1987) – an illegal street riot attended by over one million people, leading to constitutional change for direct presidential elections.  
  • Great Worker Struggle – paved the way for an independent trade union movement.

5. Repression and culminating events  
- Chun Doo-Hwan’s regime violently suppressed pro-democracy activists; notable victims included Park Jong-Chul (tortured to death) and Yonsei student Lee Han-yeol (fatally wounded by tear gas on June 9, 1987; died July 5).  
- Public outrage over these cases intensified the June Democracy Movement, resulting in the ruling government agreeing to constitutional reforms for direct elections.

Here’s a concise summary of the Korea Herald article “Historic site of Democratic Uprising divided over Yoon’s impeachment” by Hwang Joo-young (Feb. 16, 2025).  

Key facts and figures  
• Location & date: Geumnam-ro Street, Gwangju (680 m stretch from May 18 Democracy Square), Saturday (Feb. 15, 2025).  
• Simultaneous rallies:  
  – Anti-impeachment (conservative) organized by Save Korea on sections 3–4 of Geumnam-ro, 1 p.m.–5 p.m.  
  – Pro-impeachment led by Gwangju Emergency Action for Immediate Resignation of the Yoon Administration and Social Reform on the opposite side.  
• Crowd size (police unofficial, via local media):  
  – Anti-impeachment: 30,000 participants  
  – Pro-impeachment: 10,000–20,000 participants  
• This was the largest anti-impeachment rally in Gwangju since President Yoon’s martial law declaration on Dec. 3, 2024; a prior pro-Yoon rally earlier in February drew just over 50 people.  
• Police deployed riot buses to form barriers and prevent clashes.  

Speakers, slogans and themes  
• Anti-impeachment side:  
  – Slogans: “Release the president!”, “Verify the election fraud!”  
  – Jeon Han-gil (history lecturer): defended Yoon’s martial law as “an act of enlightenment,” called opposition impeachment “antidemocratic,” claimed “President Yoon is unjustly imprisoned.”  
• Pro-impeachment side:  
  – Slogans & placards: “No to dictatorship!”, “Impeach Yoon for democracy.”  
  – High-profile speakers:  
    • Gwangju Mayor Kang Gi-jung: “Gwangju is the symbolic city of democracy…holding a rally here in support of a leader who declared martial law is an insult to history.”  
    • Gov. Kim Yung-rok and Rep. Jung Chung-rae (Democratic Party) also spoke against Yoon’s administration.  

Political reactions  
• Democratic Party (main opposition):  
  – Rep. Park Chan-dae (floor leader): called the pro-Yoon demonstration “an outrage by far-right forces…mocking democratic values and constitutional order.”  
  – Rep. Park Ji-won: dismissed claims Gwangju was “split in half,” criticized religious framing of the conservative rally.  
• People Power Party (ruling):  
  – Daegu Mayor Hong Joon-pyo: termed it “the first conservative rally of this scale on Geumnam-ro since the 1980s,” suggesting a shift in Gwangju public sentiment.  
• Presidential office: “expressed strong regrets” over deepfake footage shown at the rally, vowed “firm legal action” against those responsible.  

Historical context  
• Geumnam-ro is the key site of the May 18, 1980 Gwangju Democratic Uprising against Chun Doo-hwan’s dictatorship.  
• Past major rallies on this street include the 2008 candlelight protests against President Lee Myung-bak and the 2016–17 impeachment demonstrations against President Park Geun-hye.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the CNN article “South Korea martial law ‘a painful reminder of how easily democracy can be threatened,’ protesters say” (Dec. 4, 2024) by Helen Regan and Eunseo Jeong.

Key facts and events
1. On Dec. 4, candlelit vigils and rallies were held nationwide after President Yoon Suk Yeol’s surprise six-hour declaration of martial law the previous night.
2. Hundreds gathered outside Seoul’s National Assembly Hall as opposition parties moved to impeach Yoon.
3. It was South Korea’s first martial-law declaration since its 1980s transition to democracy, prompting widespread alarm in Asia’s fourth-largest economy.
4. Six opposition parties have submitted an impeachment bill; a vote is expected as early as Friday.
5. The main opposition Democratic Party is also drafting treason charges against Yoon and his defense and interior ministers.
6. On Thursday, Yoon accepted Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun’s resignation and nominated Ambassador Choi Byung-hyuk as his replacement.

Historical context and memories
• Mi-rye (64), who came from Paju (Gyeonggi Province), said the decree revived “dark memories” of 1980s martial law under Army Major General Chun Doo-hwan—when strict curfews, mass arrests (including detentions for lacking ID), re-education camps, and press censorship prevailed. Nearly 200 people were killed in the 1980 Gwangju crackdown.
• Teacher Kyung-soo (55), who lived near Gwangju University, said he “grew up in an environment filled with fear” and worried that martial law signals a government “disconnected from the voices of its people.”

Contemporary grievances
• Moon Seo-yeon (15) joined the Seoul rally, calling Yoon’s decree a “mistake” and a “complete lack of consideration.” She cited his administration’s slow response to the October crowd crush that killed over 150 people.
• Protesters marched through central Seoul demanding Yoon’s arrest and resignation, and six opposition parties are formally pursuing his removal.

Ongoing outlook
Mi-rye vowed to continue protesting until Yoon steps down, warning that martial law could be reinstated.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the provided DW article; I have not added external information.

1. Context and Protest Dynamics  
- On December 3, 2024, following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s televised martial law declaration, citizens immediately gathered outside the National Assembly, the Constitutional Court and Gwanghwamun Square to face armed soldiers.  
- Unlike past violent clashes, protesters waved glow sticks, sang K-pop songs through the night, and dawned placards opposing Yoon and martial law.  

2. Gender Composition and Significance  
- Media estimates suggest women made up as much as 40% of demonstrators, primarily aged late teens through 40s.  
- Cameras showed women prominently at the forefront of crowds.  

3. Structural Exclusion of Women in Politics  
- Hyobin Lee (adjunct professor of politics and ethics, Chungnam National University):  
 • Only 17.1% of National Assembly members are women, reflecting “deeply entrenched exclusion.”  
 • An old Korean saying, “If a hen crows, the household will fall,” illustrates traditional expectations that women stay out of politics.  

4. Political Mobilization of Young Women  
- Ahead of the April 2024 parliamentary elections, conservative narratives on gender divisions boosted opposition Democratic Party support among women, contributing to People Power Party’s poor performance and Yoon heading a minority government.  
- In the 2022 presidential vote:  
 • 58% of women in their 20s backed Democrat Lee Jae-myung.  
 • 58.7% of men in their 20s backed Yoon.  

5. Persistent Gender Rift and Emerging Activism  
- An anonymous female academic in Seoul noted a lasting “chasm” between young men and women, driven by labor-market competition and resentment over mandatory male military service.  
- Yoon’s campaign promise to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and subsequent scrapping of gender quotas exacerbated tensions.  

6. Historical Reference and Future Outlook  
- Lee referenced the bloody May 1980 Gwangju uprising—165 civilians killed, thousands injured, 73+ missing—to contrast this generation’s first large-scale protests.  
- Lee predicts this newly assertive generation of women, accustomed to self-expression and unaccustomed to overt discrimination, will sustain and expand their political engagement.

---

## 2. **2016–2017 Candlelight Protests**  
**Dates**: October 2016 – March 2017  
**Turnout**: Peak of 2.3 million in Seoul (December 3, 2016)  
**Location**: Nationwide, centered in Seoul (Gwanghwamun Square)  
**Cause**: Corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her aide Choi Soon-sil.  
**Context**: Revelations that Park allowed Choi to meddle in state affairs and extort funds from corporations sparked national outrage. Weekly candlelight vigils mobilized millions, culminating in Park’s impeachment and removal from office.

**Location**: Seoul (Gwanghwamun Square)  
**Cause**: Gender-biased investigations and illegal filming of women.  
**Context**: Sparked by cases of hidden cameras in public spaces and perceived leniency toward perpetrators, the protest underscored systemic gender inequality.

---

## 4. **2018 Pro-American Rally Against Inter-Korean Diplomacy**  
**Date**: March 1, 2018

---

## 6. **2019 October Revolution Protests**  
**Date**: October 2019  
**Turnout**: Millions nationwide  
**Location**: Nationwide, largest in Seoul  
**Cause**: Corruption allegations against President Moon Jae-in and Cho Kuk.

Here is a concise summary of the AFP article from The Moscow Times (Oct. 23, 2024):

Facts and statistics  
• South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS), via lawmaker Park Sun-won, reports North Korea has sent an additional 1,500 troops to Russia, bringing the total deployed to about 3,000 so far.  
• The NIS expects roughly 10,000 North Korean soldiers in Russia by December.  
• The NIS previously described this as a “large-scale” deployment to assist Russia in its war against Ukraine.  
• The U.S. Department of Defense says it has evidence North Korea has sent troops to Russia.  
• Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said two North Korean brigades are undergoing training in Russia.  
• The NIS confirmed Russia is actively recruiting Korean-language interpreters.  
• North Korean troops are receiving training on military equipment, including drone operation and other technical skills.

Opinions from reliable, named sources  
• Lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun, citing NIS-briefed Russian instructors: North Korean soldiers show excellent physical stamina and morale but “lack sufficient understanding of modern warfare tactics, especially drone-based attacks,” leading instructors to warn of potentially high casualties if these troops reach frontlines.

Opinions from less-reliable/unnamed sources  
• Unnamed experts speculate that Kim Jong Un’s motive for sending troops is to acquire advanced military technologies (e.g., surveillance satellites) from Russia in return.

Note: Russia and North Korea have not publicly commented on these deployments.

**Hundreds of Protesters Arrested in Istanbul as Turkish Police Crack Down on Demonstrations**
Hundreds of protesters were arrested in Istanbul on May 1st as the Turkish police attempted to prevent demonstrations. The protests were called by labor unions and NGOs, despite a ban on demonstrations on Taksim Square, which has been in place since 1977 after 34 people died during 1st May demonstrations. The ban on demonstrations is seen as a sign that the government has turned Turkey into a police state, according to Ozgur Ozel, the leader of the CHP opposition party. The protests come after the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, a rival of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has intensified its efforts to stop an outbreak of anthrax in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where one person has died and 16 are suspected to be infected. The WHO is focusing on stopping the transmission of the disease from animals to humans. In other news, the Danish Crown slaughterhouse company has increased the price of pork and beef by 1.6 kroner per kilogram, benefiting landowners. The company has also announced that it will send more money to its shareholders. Additionally, the Tesla CEO Elon Musk has denied rumors that he is leaving the company, calling the reports 'completely false'. The company's board of directors has also confirmed that Musk will remain as CEO. The South Korean prime minister, Han Duck-soo, has resigned ahead of a presidential election in June, which was called after the previous president was impeached. The finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, will take over as acting prime minister. In Denmark, 64 drivers who received fines for not following a sign in Silkeborg will have their fines annulled and their money refunded. The sign was found to be invalid. Finally, the energy company Ørsted has sold a 24.5% stake in a British wind farm to the investment fund Schroders Greencoat for 4 billion kroner.

**Seoul Protests: Thousands Gather to Support and Oppose Yoon Impeachment**
Large-scale protests took place in Seoul on March 3, 2024, both in favor of and against the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. The protests coincided with the anniversary of the March 1st Movement for Independence against Japanese colonial rule. According to a preliminary estimate by the police, around 150,000 people participated in the protests, with 6,400 police officers and 230 police buses deployed to control the crowds. The protests, led by conservative activist pastor Jeon Kwang-hoon and the Save Korea group, began at 1:00 p.m. in the Gwanghwamun and Yeouido areas of Seoul. Decades of lawmakers from the ruling People Power Party (PPP) attended the Yeouido protest, including lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun, who delivered a message on behalf of the impeached president. According to Yoon, the president said, 'When one loses the will and sense of responsibility to defend freedom, totalitarian communism and populism will take its place,' and added that one must fight to the end 'with that will and sense of responsibility.' The protesters carried banners expressing their opposition to the impeachment and support for the declaration of martial law, while others waved the South Korean and US flags and chanted the impeached president's name. Meanwhile, a protest organized by the main opposition party, the Democratic Party (DP), and four other opposition parties, took place at 3:30 p.m. in the center of Seoul, with around 18,000 people participating, according to an unofficial estimate by the police. DP leader Lee Jae-myung denounced the PPP, saying that those who deny constitutional order and the rule of law cannot be conservatives. He added that they must defeat those who destroy the Constitution and the rule of law under the guise of conservatism and recover democracy.

**Thousands Protest in Seoul for and Against President Yoon's Removal**
Large crowds gathered in Seoul on Saturday to protest both for and against the removal of President Yoon Suk-yeol, whose term is in limbo as the Constitutional Court deliberates on the legality of his impeachment. The protests coincided with the celebrations of the Independence Movement Day, which commemorates the Korean people's uprising against Japanese colonialism on March 1, 1919. According to the local news agency Yonhap, the police mobilized 6,400 officers and 230 buses to control the crowd and prevent clashes, and restricted traffic in some areas of Sejongno and Yeoui streets in the center and financial district of Seoul, respectively. The organizers of the pro-Yoon and anti-Yoon protests, led by pastor and conservative politician Jeon Kwang-hoon and the Christian group Save Korea, and the progressive civic group Candlelight Action, respectively, estimated that around 100,000 people would participate in each concentration. The main opposition party, the Democratic Party, and four other opposition formations also called for a separate protest. South Korea is in a deep political crisis following Yoon's brief declaration of martial law on December 3, which led to his impeachment 11 days later, stripping him of his powers, although he remains in office while the case remains open in the Constitutional Court. The court has until June to determine whether to confirm or reject the impeachment. Given that the terms of two of its eight magistrates expire on April 18, the ruling is expected to be known before then, with local media pointing to mid-March as the most likely date. If the impeachment is confirmed, presidential elections will be held within 60 days of the judicial ruling. Yoon has been detained since January 14 in relation to another trial, a penal case in which he is accused of insurrection for the events of last year, the only charge against a South Korean president that does not enjoy immunity.

**Protests for and against Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment take place across South Korea**
Protests for and against the impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol took place across the country on February 22, 2025, ahead of the final hearing on March 1. The protests were held in major cities, including Seoul and Daejeon. In Seoul, a rally organized by the Korea Bar Association and the Free United Party drew an estimated 300,000 people, while a counter-protest organized by the Candlelight Action drew an estimated 3,000 people. The protesters chanted slogans such as 'Yoon Suk-yeol, step down immediately' and 'Constitutional Court Chief Justice Moon Hyung-bae, resign immediately.' The Korea Bar Association's chairman, Pastor Jeon, said, 'Now is the time to conclude. There are only a week left.' He added, 'If 1 million people gather at Gwanghwamun on 3.1, it will be a historic event like the 4.19 Revolution.' A participant, Kim Chang-gyu, said, 'I couldn't help but come out after seeing the legislative monopoly of the Democratic Party of Korea and the unfair impeachment trial by the Constitutional Court.' He added, 'I will definitely participate in the 3.1 rally.' Another participant, Kim Suk, said, 'I will definitely attend the 3.1 rally because our country is becoming left-leaning.' She added, 'I oppose the impeachment and demand the release of President Yoon.' In Daejeon, a rally organized by Save Korea, a conservative Christian group, drew an estimated 20,000 people. The rally was led by Pastor Son Hyun-bo, who said, 'On March 1, 2025, will be a greater day than March 1, 1919.' He added, 'Those who go to Gwanghwamun can go, and those who go to Yeouido can go. Save Korea will go to Yeouido and cross the Mapo Bridge.'

**Millions Protest in South Korea Demanding President Yoon's Release and Impeachment Cancellation**
Mass protests took place in South Korea, with millions of people demanding the release of President Yoon Suk-yeol and calling for the cancellation of his impeachment. According to Yonhap, an estimated 3 million people attended the rally in the Kwanhwa-mun area of Seoul, while the police unofficially counted 35,000 participants. Smaller protests were held in other cities, including Kwangju and Busan, with thousands of people demanding Yoon's immediate removal and calling for the Constitutional Court to make a decision on his impeachment as soon as possible. As reported by Ukrinform, the Seoul prosecutor's office charged Yoon with attempting a coup d'état on January 26, after he declared a state of emergency in December. The National Assembly subsequently voted to impeach Yoon, and the Constitutional Court will now decide whether to reinstate him or remove him from office permanently. 'The people have spoken, and we will not back down,' said one protester, 'We demand the immediate removal of President Yoon and the cancellation of his impeachment.'

**Myanmar Spring Revolution: Thousands Protest in South Korea for Democracy**
On February 2, 2025, thousands of people gathered in cities across South Korea, including Busan and Daegu, to mark the 4th anniversary of the Myanmar Spring Revolution. The protesters called for the end of military rule and the restoration of democracy in Myanmar. They also demanded the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy, who has been detained by the military since 2021. The protesters carried banners and chanted slogans, including 'Democracy will bloom in Myanmar and South Korea!' and 'We will not give up until democracy is restored!' The event was organized by the Myanmar Democratic Resistance Network, a coalition of 50 organizations and individuals in Busan. The network has been advocating for democracy in Myanmar since 2021 and has organized various events and campaigns to support the democratic movement. In addition to the protests in South Korea, similar events were held in other cities around the world, including London and Paris. The Myanmar military has been accused of human rights abuses and war crimes, including the use of forced labor and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. The protesters are calling for an end to these abuses and for the restoration of democracy in Myanmar. According to the Myanmar Federal Democratic Movement Committee, the number of cities occupied by the 'revolutionary army' has increased to 95, up from 84 in October last year. The committee also reported that 136 military personnel and police have defected to the side of the people since January this year, including a lieutenant colonel. The defectors have brought with them various types of weapons and ammunition. 'We will not give up until democracy is restored!' said a statement from the Myanmar Democratic Resistance Network. 'We will continue to fight for democracy and human rights in Myanmar and around the world!'

**Protests Erupt in Seoul as Supporters and Opponents of President Yoon Suk-yeol Clash**
Mass protests took place in Seoul on February 1, 2025, with supporters and opponents of South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol gathering in several areas of the city. The demonstrations were among the largest in recent times, with organizers claiming 3 million participants, while the police estimated around 38,000. Supporters of the president held a rally in the Kwanhwa-mun area, calling for Yoon's release and the cancellation of the impeachment proceedings. They waved South Korean and US flags, sang hymns, and demanded the reversal of the impeachment. Former Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who spoke at the rally, urged supporters to fight for the cancellation of the impeachment and warned that removing Yoon from power would threaten the country's stability. Meanwhile, anti-Yoon protests took place near the Constitutional Court and the Central District Court, with opposition forces and civil activists demanding the president's immediate removal and calling for the Constitutional Court to expedite the impeachment proceedings. According to their estimates, around 100,000 people participated in the anti-Yoon protests, while the police put the number at 6,000. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as 'Yoon Suk-yeol must go' and 'Defend democracy!' Some protesters vowed to continue the demonstrations until the Constitutional Court makes a final decision, with one organizer warning that if the court rejects the impeachment, the protests could escalate into more widespread movements, including strikes and blockades of administrative buildings. The protests have become a regular occurrence in the capital, causing significant disruptions to transportation, with police deploying hundreds of officers to maintain order. Despite the tensions, the demonstrations passed without major incidents. Experts note that the level of protest activity in the country has reached its highest point since Yoon's inauguration, indicating a deep-seated political crisis in South Korea. The Constitutional Court and Central District Court are expected to resume hearings after the Lunar New Year holidays, where the impeachment and charges against Yoon will be considered.

**Seoul Protests Continue: Support for and Opposition to President Yoon Suk-yeol**
Seoul, South Korea, saw continued protests both in support of and against President Yoon Suk-yeol on January 3. Approximately 35,000 people gathered in the afternoon at the Gwanghwamun Square area to support Yoon, before marching towards the Hanam-dong area in the Yongdong-gu district, where they clashed with protesters opposing Yoon. Some anti-Yoon protesters attempted to approach the presidential residence, but were blocked by police, resulting in physical altercations and the arrest of two individuals suspected of assaulting police officers. The protests also led to severe traffic congestion, with the Hanjiang Station subway line temporarily closed and trains passing through without stopping. The Chinese Embassy in South Korea warned Chinese citizens in the country to avoid participating in political activities. According to the embassy, foreign nationals are prohibited from participating in political activities in South Korea, except in cases specified by law. Violations may result in forced deportation.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Workers' Liberty article on South Korean protests**: This source describes significant labor and youth protests in South Korea, with estimates of 60,000-130,000 participants. The source is from a labor-focused publication, potentially carrying leftist bias. While it provides specific details on protest sizes and causes, the article's date is unclear, limiting its recent relevance. I'll consider the factual reporting but remain cautious about the framing.

**Wikipedia on "Student movements in Korea"**: This provides historical context on Korean student activism from 1919 through the 1980s, establishing a pattern of youth-led political protests. As an encyclopedia entry, it offers factual background without strong opinion but appears incomplete and lacks recent information.

**Korea Herald (Feb 16, 2025)**: This credible Korean news source reports on recent major protests, noting dueling rallies in Gwangju with specific crowd sizes: 30,000 anti-impeachment protesters and 10,000-20,000 pro-impeachment demonstrators. The article properly attributes opinions to named political figures while maintaining factual reporting of events.

**CNN article (Dec 4, 2024)**: This report from a major international outlet covers nationwide protests following President Yoon's martial law declaration. It includes documented rally sizes and properly attributed protester opinions. The article establishes that South Koreans mobilized quickly against perceived authoritarianism.

**BBC video brief (April 2025)**: Though brief, this BBC segment confirms President Yoon's removal from office on April 4, 2025, following impeachment over his martial law declaration. It mentions the constitutional requirement for elections within 60 days, placing them within our forecast period.

**DW article on women's protest participation**: This Deutsche Welle piece focuses on female participation in December 2024 anti-martial law protests. It cites academic expert Hyobin Lee on gender dimensions of Korean political activism, providing factual reporting with properly attributed analysis.

**Perplexity Report**: This comprehensive overview lists major South Korean protests (>10,000 participants) since 2010, detailing approximately 8 major protest waves. It shows a pattern of 1-2 large protests annually, clustered around political crises. The report draws from multiple sources and primarily presents factual information.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several potential reference classes emerge:

1. **All South Korean protests exceeding 10,000 participants since 2010**: The Perplexity report identifies about 8 such events over 15 years, suggesting a baseline frequency of roughly 1-2 major protests annually.

2. **Presidential impeachment/removal periods**: Both the Park Geun-hye (2016-2017) and Yoon Suk Yeol (2024-2025) impeachments generated multiple large protests. These periods saw particularly intense civic mobilization.

3. **Presidential election campaigns**: South Korean elections regularly generate public demonstrations, especially when following political crises.

The most appropriate reference class combines the first and third categories: the general frequency of large protests in South Korea, with special attention to presidential election periods. This is particularly relevant as South Korea will be holding a snap election during our forecast window due to Yoon's April 4, 2025 removal from office.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The forecast covers May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025 (61 days). This period notably includes:
- The constitutionally-mandated presidential election (required within 60 days of Yoon's April 4 removal, so by June 3, 2025)
- The immediate aftermath of this election

Based on the Perplexity report, South Korea averages 1-2 major protests yearly, which would translate to a ~16.7% chance in a two-month period under normal circumstances. However, presidential election campaigns historically increase protest likelihood, particularly following impeachment and when societal divisions are high.

## (d) Justification

Several factors significantly increase the probability of a 10,000+ participant protest during our forecast period:

1. **Constitutionally-required presidential election**: The BBC confirms Yoon's removal on April 4, 2025, triggering a mandatory election by June 3, which falls within our forecast window. All recent Korean presidential elections have generated significant public demonstrations.

2. **Polarized political climate**: The Korea Herald documents strong polarization as recently as February 2025, with both pro- and anti-impeachment groups mobilizing 10,000+ participants. This division will likely intensify during the election campaign.

3. **Recent protest precedent**: Multiple sources confirm South Koreans' ability and willingness to rapidly organize large demonstrations against perceived threats to democracy. The threshold of 10,000 participants has been easily exceeded multiple times in recent months.

4. **Historical pattern intensity**: The Perplexity report shows that presidential transitions following impeachment (as in 2017) generate particularly large and sustained protest waves.

5. **Campaign events as triggers**: Presidential campaigns typically include rallies, debates, and policy announcements that can serve as focal points for public demonstrations, especially in a tense post-impeachment environment.

# Outside view calibration:

Based on the pattern of South Korean protests since 2010, the baseline probability of a 10,000+ participant protest in any random two-month period would be approximately 16-17%. However, the upcoming two months are far from random:

1. The timeframe encompasses a special presidential election necessitated by impeachment.
2. Recent demonstrations in February 2025 already crossed the 10,000-participant threshold on both sides of the political divide.
3. South Korea's protest culture is robust, with citizens demonstrating readiness to mobilize quickly.
4. The political environment remains highly charged following Yoon's controversial martial law declaration and subsequent removal.

Considering these factors, I assess there's a significantly elevated chance of a 10,000+ participant protest occurring and being reported by the Global Protest Tracker before July 1, 2025. The election campaign alone substantially increases this likelihood, and the post-election period may also generate demonstrations if the results are contested or if supporters/opponents of the winner mobilize.

   - Establishes President Yoon declared martial law on Dec 3, 2024, followed by impeachment
   - Quality: Mainstream Korean newspaper, likely reliable for factual reporting
   - Contains attributed opinions from officials on both sides

4. **CNN article (Dec 4, 2024)**
   - Reports nationwide protests after Yoon's martial law declaration
   - Notes "hundreds gathered outside Seoul's National Assembly"
   - Quality: Reputable international source, but lacks specific protest numbers
   - Contains opinions from protesters but they're clearly marked as such

5. **BBC news brief (April 2025)**
   - Reports Constitutional Court upheld Yoon's impeachment on April 4, 2025
   - Notes a snap election must be held within 60 days (early June 2025)
   - Quality: Reputable international source but very brief with limited details

6. **DW article on women's participation in protests**
   - Details immediate protests following Yoon's martial law declaration
   - Notes women comprised ~40% of demonstrators
   - Quality: Reputable international source with expert opinion from an academic source (Hyobin Lee)

7. **Perplexity report on major protests since 2010**
   - Comprehensive list of 10,000+ participant protests with dates, turnouts, locations, causes
   - Key recent protests: 2024 Climate Justice Protests (30,000+), 2024-2025 Impeachment Protests (up to 600,000 on March 1, 2025)
   - Quality: Well-sourced compilation with multiple citations
   - Most valuable for establishing frequency patterns of large protests

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several reference classes are relevant:

1. **Recent large protests in South Korea (past 5 years)**
   - Multiple 10,000+ participant protests occurred: 2019 Prosecution Reform, 2019 October Revolution, 2024 Climate Justice, 2024-2025 Impeachment protests
   - Demonstrates continued capacity and willingness for mass mobilization
   - **Highly suitable** as it reflects current political climate and protest patterns

2. **Post-presidential impeachment periods**
   - Two recent presidential impeachments (Park Geun-hye and Yoon Suk Yeol)
   - Both triggered sustained large-scale protests
   - **Highly suitable** given Yoon's recent impeachment (April 4, 2025)

3. **Election-related protests**
   - South Korean elections often spark demonstrations
   - **Highly suitable** as a snap election must occur by early June 2025

4. **Annual frequency of large protests**
   - Perplexity data suggests 1-2 major protests (10,000+) yearly since 2010
   - Provides baseline frequency

The most appropriate reference class combines recent large-scale protest patterns with the specific context of post-impeachment/pre-election dynamics, as we're in precisely this situation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The forecast period is May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025 (2 months), with these key considerations:

- Constitutional Court upheld Yoon's impeachment on April 4, 2025
- A snap presidential election must occur by early June 2025 (within our forecast window)
- From the Perplexity report, we know South Korea experienced 1-2 large protests annually since 2010
- Political transitions historically trigger protests both before and after elections
- The most recent major protest (March 1, 2025) mobilized 600,000 people in Seoul
- As of February 2025, simultaneous pro/anti-impeachment rallies drew 30,000 and 10,000-20,000 respectively

## (d) Justification

Several factors strongly suggest high likelihood of a 10,000+ participant protest during our forecast period:

1. **Ongoing political crisis**: South Korea is in the midst of a political transition following a controversial presidential impeachment just one month ago, with polarized supporters on both sides.

2. **Mandatory election timing**: A snap presidential election must occur during our forecast period by constitutional requirement (within 60 days of April 4, making early June the deadline).

3. **Recent demonstration capacity**: South Koreans have already demonstrated capacity for large-scale mobilization in 2025, with a 600,000-person protest in March and dual protests exceeding 10,000 participants in February.

4. **Multiple potential triggers**: Beyond election campaigning and results, ongoing grievances related to martial law, democratic backsliding, and the impeachment itself could independently trigger protests.

5. **Historical patterns**: The Perplexity report shows that periods of political upheaval in South Korea frequently produce sustained protest waves lasting months.

6. **Seasonal significance**: June marks the anniversary of the 1987 June Democracy Movement, providing symbolic timing for democracy-themed demonstrations.

## Outside View Calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I'll consider:

1. **Baseline frequency**: South Korea experiences 1-2 protests of 10,000+ participants annually (per Perplexity data), which translates to approximately 16-33% probability in any typical 2-month period.

2. **Current context adjustment**: We're in an extraordinary period featuring:
   - Presidential impeachment upheld just weeks ago (April 4)
   - A constitutionally required election during our forecast window
   - Recent demonstrations of 10,000+ as recently as February 2025
   - A massive 600,000-person protest just two months ago (March 2025)

3. **Expert assessment**: According to Professor Hyobin Lee (cited in DW), the current generation is likely to sustain and expand political engagement.

Given the escalated political tensions, the scheduled election, and the demonstrated capacity and willingness for mass mobilization in early 2025, the probability significantly exceeds the baseline rate. The most recent data points show multiple protests exceeding 10,000 participants in the months immediately preceding our forecast period, within the same political crisis.

## Outside View Prediction:
93%

The likelihood of a protest with 10,000+ participants in South Korea before July 1, 2025 is extremely high given the ongoing political crisis, the guaranteed election within this timeframe, and demonstrated protest capacity in recent months. South Korea has already experienced multiple protests exceeding this threshold in early 2025, and the political situation remains unresolved.

2. Reference-class analysis  
Potential reference classes for “10k+ protests in S. Korea over a short window”:  
  A. Post-2010 “mass political protests” (e.g. impeachment, labour, climate)  
  B. Major single-issue protests (labour law, gender rights, environment)  
  C. Political-crisis protests (martial law, impeachment)  

Suitability:  
  • Class A (general mass protests) is the broadest and longest series but mixes very different drivers.  
  • Class B (single-issue) undercounts the crisis-driven mobilizations of 2024–25.  
  • Class C (political crises) most closely matches the current environment: martial law, impeachment, snap election.  

Chosen reference class: C – political-crisis protests (2016 labour‐youth crisis; 2016–17 presidential scandal; 2024–25 martial law/impeachment).  

Within Class C:  
  – Nov. 2016: ~100k  
  – Dec. 2016–Mar. 2017: peak 2.3 m weekly vigils  
  – Dec. 2024: candlelit vigils—hundreds at each site, but aggregation uncertain  
  – Feb. 2025: 30k anti-impeachment, 10k–20k pro-impeachment  

3. Timeframe analysis  
  • Forecast window: May 1–July 1 2025 = 61 days (~2 months).  
  • Historical pace in Class C:  
     – Impeachment scandal 2016–17: ~1 major rally per month at 10k+ scale, spiking to weekly.  
     – Martial-law crisis December 2024–February 2025: ~1 mobilization every 4–6 weeks at 10k+ scale.  
  • Outside immediate crisis, South Korea averages ~2 mass protests/year.  

4. Justification for outside view prediction  
  • Baseline rate: ~2 protests ≥10k per year ⇒ ~0.17 events/month ⇒ ~0.33 events in 2 months.  
  • Crisis uplift: current political crisis is still unfolding.  
     – The Constitutional Court removed Yoon on April 4; snap election must occur by early June ⇒ intense months for rallies.  
     – Opposing camps (conservatives, progressives) both have incentives to mobilize around campaign, impeachment legacies.  
  • Venue effect: The Global Protest Tracker captures only protests actually reported; high-profile events (Gwangju, Seoul) are almost certain to be picked up.  
  • Countervailing factors: protest fatigue after 6 months of high tension; authorities may restrict large gatherings near election.  

Integrating baseline and crisis factors yields a median probability somewhere between the naive 28% (baseline) and an elevated 70% (crisis-driven).  

Outside view calibration  
  • Base-rate expectation (adjusted): ~33% chance for any given 2-month window in a “normal” year.  
  • Crisis multiplier: 1.5–2× baseline, given ongoing impeachment/election turmoil and historical monthly pace ~0.25–0.33 events/month ⇒ raise chance to ~50–60%.  
  • Fatigue/constraints discount: ~0.8 factor ⇒ bring lower bound to ~40%.  

Therefore, a calibrated outside-view probability falls in the 45%–65% range, centered near 55%.  

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 56% chance that the Global Protest Tracker will report at least one protest in South Korea with 10,000+ participants starting between now (May 1, 2025) and July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Workers’ Liberty article (2017, “South Korea: Labour and youth protests”): A left‐wing activist outlet with detailed first‐hand reporting on November–December protests against labour and education reforms. Numbers (60,000–130,000 in Seoul) are plausible and cited; the piece mixes factual reporting of events and some activist framing. Treat turnout and date data as reliable; discount broader normative language.  
- Wikipedia, “Student movements in Korea”: A general encyclopedia summary of student‐led protests from 1919 through the 1980s. Useful for understanding South Korea’s deep protest traditions but not directly relevant to post–2010 frequency. Article is fact‐based but incomplete.  
- Korea Herald (Feb. 16 2025, “Historic site of Democratic Uprising divided over Yoon’s impeachment”): Reputable English‐language daily in Seoul. Provides police/unofficial turnout figures (30,000 anti-impeachment; 10,000–20,000 pro-impeachment) and precise dates/locations. High quality, low opinion.  
- CNN (Dec. 4 2024, martial law protests): Major international outlet. Reports nationwide candlelight rallies with “hundreds” in Seoul; historical context of martial law. Useful for background but no 10,000+ claims.  
- BBC video briefs (Apr. 2025): Mentions public reaction to Yoon’s removal; does not quantify protests in 10k+ terms. Low relevance.  
- Deutsche Welle (Dec. 2024, women in martial-law protests): Solid reporting on gender composition (∼40% women) and protest style. No aggregate turnout figures above “thousands.” Secondary relevance.  
- Perplexity_report (“Major protests in South Korea Since 2010”): Aggregate listing of protests with >10k participants. Draws on multiple sources. Good for constructing a rough event list but may omit or misdate smaller rallies. Use its event catalogue (dates, turnouts, causes) with caution and cross-check where possible.

2. Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
(a) All protests of ≥10k participants in South Korea, 2010–2025.  
(b) Instances of large protests in other established democracies in any given two-month window.  
(c) South Korean protests specifically during periods of political turbulence (impeachments, elections).  
Most suitable: Class (a) tied to two‐month windows. It directly matches the question (“any ≥10k protest in SK”), allows counting historical months with such protests, and sets a baseline frequency.

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Forecast window: May 1 to July 1, 2025 (≈2 months).  
- Historical data (Jan 2010–Mar 2025): 15 distinct months contained at least one ≥10k protest, clustering into seven multi-month episodes (Nov 2010; Oct 2016–Mar 2017; Mar 2018; Aug 2018; Sep 2019–Dec 2019; Sep 2024; Feb 2025).  
- Mapping those episodes to contiguous 2-month windows yields ~22 two‐month windows with ≥1 ≥10k event out of ~182 total windows over the period. That implies a raw baseline of roughly 12% for any random two‐month span.

4. Additional factors  
- Clustering: big protests appear in campaigns around scandals (2016–17, 2019), rarely in “quiet” interims.  
- Current context: Yoon’s removal (Apr 2025) and an impending snap presidential election (within 60 days of removal, i.e., by early June) may provoke demonstrations. But snap elections in SK historically do not trigger 10k+ protests unless results are disputed.  
- Labour rights: no major reform battles on the docket that we know of for May–June 2025.  
- Environmental and gender activism have produced isolated events (e.g., Sep 2024 climate march), but none announced for May–June.  
- Status quo suggests lower protest intensity post-removal and during the immediate campaign, absent a new catalyst.

Justification for outside view: The historically observed frequency of ≥10k protests in any given two‐month window is roughly 12%. Upcoming election timing could bump that slightly, but absent a clear, widely mobilizing grievance, the probability remains modestly above baseline. I round up modestly to account for electoral friction.

Outside view calibration:  
- Baseline two-month probability from 2010–2025: ~12%  
- Adjustment for snap election context: +3 points → 15%  
- No strong labour or social‐movement catalyst evident → minimal further increase  
- Final outside‐view floor: ~15%

Outside View Prediction: 15% (±1%)

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Workers’ Liberty article (2017).  Describes a large 2015 labour rally, gives turnout ranges and police response.  Factual details (injuries, arrests) are sourced to police and unions; commentary (“terrorist elements”) is clearly labelled as Park Geun-hye’s opinion.  Overall, a niche left-wing outlet but the basic numeric facts line up with other contemporary reporting → moderate reliability for size/frequency of big rallies.  
• Wikipedia entry on “Student movements in Korea”.  Long-time-scale historical narrative (1919-1987).  Specific dates, casualty figures, constitutional changes are well-sourced; interpretive language (“Marxist influence”) is editorial.  Reliable for the fact that mass mobilisation is part of Korean political culture, but not for current probability.  
• Korea Herald (16 Feb 2025).  A mainstream, centrist newspaper.  Gives police-based crowd estimates (30 k and 10–20 k) for two rival rallies in Gwangju.  These figures are straightforward facts; quoted politician statements are opinion.  High reliability.  
• CNN (4 Dec 2024).  Major international outlet.  Reports “hundreds” outside the National Assembly the day after martial law, and notes ongoing impeachment move.  The only quantitative fact is “hundreds,” which is far below the 10 k threshold, but the piece confirms political tension.  High reliability for basic facts.  
• BBC video brief (4 Apr 2025).  Confirmed Constitutional Court removal of President Yoon, references “violent protests,” but no size numbers.  BBC is high-quality, but for our purpose it only shows that a trigger for mobilisation exists.  
• DW (Dec 2024).  Focuses on gender composition of martial-law protests; no crowd size >10 k stated.  Shows that demonstrations were nation-wide and continuous.  Moderate reliability.  
• Perplexity compiled list (LLM-generated).  Gives a catalogue of post-2010 large protests with cited press sources.  Because the list is second-hand, each event needs spot-checking, but the overall count (≈7–8 distinct 10 k+ protests since 2010) is plausible and consistent with the Carnegie tracker itself.  Use as approximate quantitative base only.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. “Any country” global frequency of protests ≥10 k → too coarse (South Korea has a distinctive protest culture).  
2. “OECD democracies” with population 40–60 m (e.g., Spain, UK, France, Italy) → better, but still heterogeneous in protest regulation.  
3. “South Korea new entries in the Carnegie Global Protest Tracker with ≥10 k participants.” This is the metric the question will use for resolution and is therefore the most direct reference class.  

Using the public GPT dataset, South Korea has 7 distinct entries that start between Jan 2010 and Apr 2024 (Candlelight 2016–17, Women’s ‘spycam’ 2018, Cho Kuk 2019, Pro-Moon/anti-Moon duelling rallies late-2019, Climate protest 2024, Martial-law/Impeachment protest Dec 2024).  That is roughly 0.5 new qualifying protests per calendar year.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time remaining until the deadline: 1 May 2025 → 1 Jul 2025 = 61 days ≈ 0.17 years.  
If new 10 k+ protests arrive as a Poisson process with λ = 0.5 / year, expected events in 61 days = λ × 0.17 ≈ 0.085.  
P(at least one) = 1 – e^(–0.085) ≈ 0.08 (8%).  

Sensitivity:  
• If true annual rate were 1.0 (upper end of plausible), P ≈ 15%.  
• If 0.25, P ≈ 4%.  
So the outside-view probability naturally sits in the 5–15 % band.

(d) Justification  
– The Carnegie tracker adds about one South-Korea entry every two years.  
– Those entries are often clustered around extraordinary political shocks (Park impeachment, Cho Kuk controversy, Yoon martial law) rather than occurring randomly every year.  Because one such shock (Yoon’s removal) has already happened in April 2025, the outside view does not assume another fresh trigger inside the next two months.  
– Seasonality: very large Korean protests typically peak in the late-autumn or early-winter (Oct–Dec) candle-light tradition; May–June do see commemorative May 18 Gwangju rallies, but these have rarely reached the 10 k-threshold lately and when they did (e.g., 2002, 2020 anniversaries) they were already logged earlier in the year.  
– Therefore, starting from the historical 8 % baseline and allowing for parameter uncertainty (0.5 ↔ 1.0 events/yr), a sensible outside-view range is 5–15 %.  A mid-point of 12 % adequately centres that range while giving modest weight to the fact that political tension is elevated in 2025 relative to a typical year, yet still refrains from incorporating detailed “inside” knowledge of current mobilisation plans.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: Poisson model with λ = 0.5 year⁻¹ → 8%.  
Add ±4 pp for uncertainty over λ and date bunching → 8 % ± 4 %.  
Rounded central estimate: 12%.

Outside View Prediction:
12 %

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

I'll briefly evaluate each source for quality, recency, and factual content:

**Yonhap News Agency (Aug 2020)**: Reliable Korean news source reporting factually on a 20,000-person conservative protest. While high-quality, it's from 2020, offering historical context rather than current predictive value.

**Swarthmore NVDB on 2016-17 Candlelight Revolution**: Academic database providing detailed factual documentation of the massive protests (up to 2.32 million participants) that led to Park Geun-hye's impeachment. High-quality historical reference point.

**Swarthmore NVDB on 2008 US beef protests**: Academic documentation of multiple 10,000+ participant protests over economic policy. Demonstrates South Koreans' willingness to mobilize over various issues.

**Korea JoongAng Daily (Dec 2024)**: Recent reporting (5 months ago) on nationwide candlelight vigils against President Yoon after martial law declaration, including a 10,000-person rally in Seoul. Factually reports organizer and police estimates.

**The Moscow Times (Oct 2024)**: Reports on North Korean troops being sent to Russia. Factually presents information from South Korean intelligence sources. Limited relevance to domestic protest likelihood.

**AskNews articles (Jan-May 2025)**: Multiple recent reports including:
- May 1, 2025: Reports of 2,500 people at labor rights rally in Daegu
- May 1, 2025: Dueling protests in Seoul over Constitutional Court verdict on Lee Jae-myung
- March 2025: Large protests regarding Yoon's impeachment with estimates of 150,000 participants
- February 2025: Massive protests with competing turnout claims (organizers: 3 million; police: 35,000-38,000)
- January 2025: 35,000 people protesting in support of Yoon

These recent sources establish factual patterns of protest activity, though exact numbers vary between police and organizer estimates.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **Recent large-scale protests**: Multiple independent sources document protests exceeding 10,000 participants in early 2025 (January-March), demonstrating both capability and willingness to mobilize.
- **Constitutional election requirement**: President Yoon appears to have been removed in April 2025, triggering a constitutional requirement for elections within 60 days (by early June), which falls within our forecast period.
- **Established protest infrastructure**: The 2016-17 Candlelight Revolution demonstrated South Korea's robust protest organization capacity, with multiple civic groups able to rapidly coordinate demonstrations.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Ongoing political polarization**: Recent protests show continued sharp divisions between pro-Yoon and anti-Yoon factions, with both sides demonstrating ability to mobilize thousands.
- **Multiple potential triggers**: The timeframe includes Labor Day, presidential campaigning, election day, court decisions on political figures, and post-election government formation.
- **Historical frequency**: South Korea historically experiences 1-2 protests exceeding 10,000 participants annually, with higher frequency during political crises and elections.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Recent 2,500-person labor protest**: While below threshold, this Daegu protest (smaller city) suggests ongoing labor activism that could scale larger in Seoul.
- **International tensions**: North Korea-Russia military cooperation could potentially trigger nationalist protests, though connection is indirect.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is May 1, 2025, to July 1, 2025 (61 days). 

Critically, this period encompasses:
- The constitutionally-mandated presidential election (required by early June 2025)
- The entire campaign period leading up to this election
- The immediate post-election period during which a new government will form

If the timeframe were halved (30-31 days), the probability would decrease moderately as we might miss either the election itself or post-election protests. If doubled (122 days), the probability would increase slightly as it would include more potential trigger events and the full implementation of new policies by the incoming administration.

## (d) Justification

Several factors significantly increase the probability above the historical baseline rate:

1. **Special election circumstances**: This is not a regular election but one triggered by impeachment, which historically generates heightened civic engagement and protest. The 2016-17 precedent saw massive sustained protests during a similar impeachment-triggered election period.

2. **Recent protest activity**: Multiple sources confirm protests exceeding 10,000 participants already occurred multiple times in early 2025, establishing both capability and momentum.

3. **Sharp political polarization**: The impeachment of President Yoon has created deep societal divisions, with passionate supporters and opponents already demonstrating willingness to mobilize in large numbers.

4. **Multiple high-profile triggers**: Beyond the election itself, the timeframe includes potential court decisions on political figures, campaign events, and the formation of a new government - each representing a potential protest catalyst.

5. **Global Protest Tracker reporting likelihood**: Given that recent Korean protests have received international attention and coverage, it's highly likely that any 10,000+ person protest would be captured by the tracker.

# Probability calibration

Starting with an outside view based on historical patterns, South Korea typically experiences 1-2 protests exceeding 10,000 participants annually, which would translate to roughly 25-30% probability in a random two-month period.

However, this is not a random period - it encompasses a special presidential election triggered by impeachment. The last such period (2016-17) saw weekly protests exceeding our threshold. Combined with:
- Recent evidence of multiple 10,000+ protests already occurring in 2025
- The certainty of a presidential election within our timeframe
- Documented sharp political divisions
- Multiple potential triggers beyond just the election

I assess the probability at 83%. This reflects that in approximately 83 out of 100 similar two-month periods containing a post-impeachment presidential election in South Korea, at least one protest exceeding 10,000 participants would occur and be captured by a global tracker.

## Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase**: Will Global Protest Tracker report a South Korean protest with 10,000+ participants between May 1-July 1, 2025?
2. **Base rate**: 25-30% for random two-month period; 75%+ for election periods
3. **Consistency**: In 83/100 similar post-impeachment election periods, a 10,000+ protest would occur
4. **Key evidence**: Post-impeachment election by June; multiple 10,000+ protests already in 2025; established protest infrastructure; sharp political divisions
5. **Blind spot**: Sudden national unity candidate or external security crisis might reduce protest likelihood
6. **Status quo**: Current pattern is frequent large protests during political transition periods

Probability: 83%
Predicted Probability: 83.0%

   - **Quality**: Major Korean newspaper (English edition)
   - **Content**: Reports nationwide candlelight vigils after Yoon's martial law declaration; 10,000 in Seoul (organizer estimate)
   - **Factual vs. Opinion**: Typical discrepancy between organizer (10,000) and police (2,000) estimates

5. **Moscow Times (Oct. 2024)**
   - **Quality**: Independent English-language Russian newspaper
   - **Content**: Reports on North Korean troops sent to Russia
   - **Relevance**: Low - potential security concern but not directly related to protests

### Current Information (Asknews Articles, April-May 2025)
6. **Daegu Labor Day Rally (May 1, 2025)**
   - **Quality**: Newsis (major Korean news agency)
   - **Content**: Reports 2,500 people at labor rights rally in Daegu today
   - **Relevance**: High - shows active protests happening now, though below 10,000 threshold

7. **Lee Jae-myung Constitutional Court Case (May 1, 2025)**
   - **Quality**: Newsis
   - **Content**: Reports protests in Seoul around Lee's case with police deploying 780 officers
   - **Relevance**: High - indicates ongoing political tension and active protests

8. **Seoul Protests Planning (April 30, 2025)**
   - **Quality**: Newsis
   - **Content**: Lists various protests scheduled for May 1st in Seoul
   - **Relevance**: High - indicates multiple coordinated protests planned for today

9. **Massive Protests (March 21, 2025)**
   - **Quality**: Maeil Business Newspaper (major Korean publication)
   - **Content**: Reports police expectation of 320,000 protesters for weekend rallies on impeachment
   - **Relevance**: High - indicates recent very large protests related to current political crisis

10. **Seoul Protests (March 3, 2025)**
    - **Quality**: Yonhap News Agency
    - **Content**: Reports 150,000 participants (police estimate) in protests for/against Yoon's impeachment
    - **Relevance**: High - confirms large recent protests exceeding 10,000 threshold

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
1. **Recent large protests confirmed**: Police estimates from March 2025 (150,000 protesters) and February 2025 (38,000) establish a clear pattern of large mobilizations following Yoon's impeachment.

2. **Historical precedent established**: The 2016-2017 Candlelight Revolution demonstrates South Korea's capacity for sustained large-scale protests (weekly rallies of 1+ million people).

3. **Institutional factors - election timing**: The Constitutional Court removed Yoon on April 4, 2025, triggering a mandatory presidential election by early June 2025 (within our forecast window).

### Moderate Evidence
1. **Active protest environment**: Today's confirmed protests across multiple cities show ongoing mobilization, though the only specific figure (2,500 in Daegu) is below threshold.

2. **Political polarization**: Multiple sources confirm strong divisions between pro-Yoon and anti-Yoon factions, with both sides actively mobilizing.

3. **Labor activism**: Labor Day protests today demonstrate continued activism on economic issues, which historically can generate large turnouts.

### Weak Evidence
1. **Organizer estimates**: Claims from protest organizers (e.g., "10,000 participants") are typically inflated compared to police estimates.

2. **Protest fatigue speculation**: Some expert opinions suggest potential "protest fatigue" after months of demonstrations, but this lacks empirical support.

## Timeframe Analysis
- Prediction timeframe: May 1, 2025 - July 1, 2025 (61 days)
- Key events within timeframe:
  * Today (May 1, 2025): Labor Day protests occurring across South Korea
  * By early June 2025: Mandatory presidential election following Yoon's removal
  * Constitutional Court verdict on Lee Jae-myung's case (date unknown)

If the timeframe were halved (30 days), my prediction would increase moderately because the election period would constitute a larger proportion of the forecast window.

If the timeframe were doubled (120 days), my prediction would increase substantially because it would capture both the election period and potential post-election protests depending on the outcome.

## Justification
Starting from the outside view base rate of 56%, I adjust based on several compelling factors:

1. **Upcoming presidential election** (+15%): Elections reliably trigger large demonstrations in South Korea, especially contentious ones following impeachment. The election must occur within our forecast period (by early June).

2. **Recent demonstration patterns** (+10%): Multiple protests exceeding 10,000 participants have occurred in February-March 2025, establishing a pattern of large mobilizations in the current political environment.

3. **Active protest environment** (+5%): Today's protests across multiple cities demonstrate continued mobilization capacity, even if individual events are below threshold.

4. **Protest fatigue possibility** (-5%): After months of demonstrations since December 2024, some reduction in participation might occur.

5. **Post-election normalization** (-5%): If the election proceeds smoothly in early June, the latter part of our window might see reduced protest activity.

# Probability Calibration
Starting with the outside view base rate of 56%, the adjustments above would yield a raw probability of 76%. However, to avoid overconfidence and account for potential overlap in factors, I'll reduce the total adjustment to +14%.

My calibrated inside view probability is therefore 70%.

# Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase**: Will the Global Protest Tracker report any South Korean protests with 10,000+ participants between May 1-July 1, 2025?
2. **Base rate**: 56% chance based on historical patterns of South Korean protests during political crises.
3. **Consistency**: In 70 of 100 similar situations with upcoming elections after impeachment, South Korea would see at least one 10,000+ protest within two months.
4. **Key evidence**: Mandatory presidential election by early June; confirmed 150,000-person protest in March; continued active protests today; strong partisan polarization.
5. **Blind spot**: The election could occur early and be accepted by all parties, leading to rapid normalization.
6. **Status quo**: The current environment includes regular large protests; given the 2-month window and upcoming election, continuity of this pattern is likely.

Probability: 70%
Predicted Probability: 70.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase & Resolution  
Will the Carnegie Endowment’s Global Protest Tracker record at least one protest in South Korea with 10,000+ participants whose start date falls between May 1, 2025 and July 1, 2025?  

2. Outside-View Base Rate  
Since 2010, South Korea has averaged about 1–2 protests per year with 10,000+ participants (≈20–40% annual chance), with higher frequency in years of political crisis.  

3. Source Analysis  
a. Perplexity “Major Protests since 2010” (compiled 2024)  
 • Lists multiple 10k+ protests in 2024–25: Climate Justice (30k+), Impeachment rallies (up to 600k in March 2025).  
 • Quality: Comprehensive, well-sourced; strong evidence of current high protest frequency.  

b. Korea Herald (Feb 16, 2025)  
 • Reports 30k anti-impeachment and 10–20k pro-impeachment in Gwangju.  
 • Quality: Established outlet; clear, attributable figures.  

c. DW on Women in Protests (Dec 2024)  
 • Notes immediate large mobilizations after martial-law order, 40% women.  
 • Quality: Reputable; expert commentary (Hyobin Lee).  

d. Asknews (Jan–May 2025 South Korea protests)  
 • Jan–Mar 2025: multiple protests in Seoul & major cities, e.g., Mar 1: 600k, Feb 1: 38k police estimate (organizers 3 million), Feb 22: 300k in Seoul, 20k in Daejeon.  
 • Apr 30–May 1: mass Labor Day rallies scheduled (expected tens of thousands).  
 • Quality: Mix of local wire services (Yonhap, Newsis), generally reliable for turnout estimates.  

4. Evidence Weighing  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
 • Perplexity report & Korea Herald confirm protests >10k as recent as Mar 2025 (Strong).  
 • Constitutional crisis + looming snap election → proven mobilization triggers (Strong).  
 • Labor Day holiday tradition of candlelight/labor rallies >10k (Strong).  

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
 • DW’s gender-in-protests detail — shows broad base but not turnout size (Moderate).  

Weak evidence (small shifts):  
 • Anecdotal or single-day reporting discrepancies between organizer vs. police counts (Weak).  

5. Timeframe Analysis  
Forecast window is ~60 days.  
• If window were halved (~30 days), still covers May 1 Labor Day and pre-election campaigning → probability remains high (~90%).  
• If window were doubled (~120 days), covers election aftermath → probability would approach ~98–99%.  

6. Justification & Inside View Adjustment  
Reference-class baseline: ~20–40% chance per year → ~5–10% in any two-month slice under normal conditions.  
Adjustments:  
• Ongoing constitutional crisis with massive, sustained protests since December 2024.  
• Snap presidential election mandated by early June 2025—precedent shows elections spark large rallies.  
• Historical pattern: political crises + symbolic anniversaries (June Democracy Movement) → additional mobilization.  
• Imminent Labor Day (May 1) rallies routinely exceed 10k in Seoul and other cities.  

Given multiple, overlapping mobilization drivers and demonstrated turnout well above 10k in recent months, I raise the forecast from a 5–10% baseline to a very high probability.  

Probability calibration  
I estimate ~95% that the Global Protest Tracker will record at least one 10,000+-participant protest in South Korea between May 1 and July 1, 2025.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase & resolution aligned.  
2. Base rate ~20–40% yearly; adjusted for crisis & holiday.  
3. “95 out of 100 times, we see ≥10k protests in this window.”

 – Snap election + crisis → proven trigger.  
5. Blind spot: Crisis abruptly resolves (e.g., caretaker government quells dissent) → could reduce turnout.  
6. Status quo: High volatility & sustained protest → supports Yes.

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase & Resolution  
We’re forecasting whether the Global Protest Tracker will report a South Korean protest of ≥10,000 people that starts between May 1, 2025 and July 1, 2025.  

2. Source analysis  
- Historical protest catalogs (Perplexity report, NVDB, Wikipedia): Aggregate data on large protests since 2010. Generally reliable for dates and crowd‐size estimates; some minor inconsistencies but overall good coverage.  
- Yonhap/Korea Herald/CNN/AFP articles on specific protests (2016–17 Candlelight, 2008 beef, 2024 martial-law rallies): High‐quality, named sources with police vs. organizer figures. Factual turnout data are solid.  
- AskNews articles (May 1 2025): Multiple Newsis and Yonhap pieces show May 1 labor‐day events in Daegu (~2,500) and scattered ≤10,000 “candlelight” or election-related gatherings in Seoul, but none ≥10,000 starting after May 1. These sources are timely and credible for May 1 reporting.  

3. Outside view base rate  
From Jan 2010–Mar 2025, roughly 22 two-month windows out of ~182 featured a ≥10,000 protest in SK ⇒ base rate ≈12%.  

4. Evidence weighting  
Strong (historical pattern): Large protests in South Korea occur in clustered episodes around major scandals (e.g., 2016–17, 2019, early 2025 impeachment crisis).  
Moderate (current trends): Snap presidential election campaign expected in June 2025 could spur demonstrations, but campaign rallies ≠ protests and so far no major mobilizing grievance is publicized.  
Weak (anecdotal): Smaller labor and civic rallies (May 1 Daegu) underline ongoing activism but well below 10,000.  

5. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window = ~2 months. If halved (1 month), probability would roughly halve to ~7%. If doubled (4 months), probability would rise toward ~25% given more opportunities and historical clustering.  

6. Inside‐view justification & shift  
- Base rate ~12%.  
- Snap election context adds some risk (+3 points) because contested elections can trigger protests if there’s a disputed outcome or controversial policies, though no current flashpoints.  
- Lack of any announced mass‐mobilization campaign or new crisis tempers the bump.  

Inside‐view adjustment: 12% + 3% = 15%.  

Probability calibration  
I estimate about a 15% chance that the Global Protest Tracker will report a protest of 10,000+ participants in South Korea starting before July 1, 2025.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast of ≥10,000‐person protest in SK during May–June 2025.  
2. Base rate: ~12% for any random 2-month window historically.  
3. Consistency: “In 15 out of 100 comparable 2-month spans, SK has a ≥10k protest,” aligned with my 15% forecast.  
4. Top evidences:  
   - Historical frequency of 10k+ protests (strong).  
   - Upcoming snap election (moderate).  
   - No current large‐scale grievance (weak).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden economic crisis or foreign policy shock (e.g., military incident with North Korea) could spark a ≥10k protest, making this forecast too low.  
6. Status quo: SK protest activity has dropped from early 2025 highs; absent new catalysts, status quo favors no 10k event.  

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Yonhap Aug-2020, NVDB 2008 & 2016-17 entries – reliable, give historical scale & cadence of Korean mass protests; opinion separated from factual crowd counts.  
• Korea JoongAng Daily 5 Dec 2024 – mainstream national daily, photographs; organiser put Seoul crowd at 10 000. Facts (locations, policing) solid; numbers still organiser-side.  
• Asknews compilation (Jan–May 2025) – mix of NEWSIS, MK, Yonhap, KBS, etc. All mainstream Korean outlets dated within the last three months. They repeatedly quote police logistics data (mobile units deployed, traffic diversions) plus organiser/police turnout estimates (from 35 000 up to “300 000”).  These are factual enough for “size >10 000” but do not tell us how Carnegie will code them.  
Overall, most items are timely, come from wire services or major papers and carry verifiable crowd figures → moderate-to-high source quality.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong  
• Persistently very large impeachment-related rallies in Feb–Mar 2025 (organisers claim 0.3–3 million; police concede 30 000-150 000).  
• Forthcoming extraordinary presidential election (late-June) – historically increases protest likelihood (2002, 2012 truckers, 2017 candlelight).  
Moderate  
• Labour-movement tradition of 1 May and 18 May (Gwangju) rallies; most years remain below 10 k but occasionally exceed.  
• Carnegie tracker update lag is typically 3-10 weeks – still enough time for a new May/June protest to be logged before 1 July.  
Weak  
• Seasonality: Korean mega-protests peak Oct–Dec, making May/Jun somewhat less likely.  
• Possible “lumping” risk – Carnegie may treat all impeachment-related street actions as one campaign that started Dec 2024 (pre-question), meaning new rallies would not be a fresh entry.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
61 days remain.  If the window were doubled to four months I would raise the probability by roughly 1.6× (lag room + more potential triggers). If it were halved to one month I would cut the probability by about one-third because (i) election trigger disappears and (ii) Carnegie update lag could miss late-May events.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (Poisson with λ≈0.5 big new protests / year) → 12 %.  
Upward adjustments  
+6 pp  Elevated political crisis: sitting president removed; snap election in June – historically fertile ground for new, distinct protest campaigns.  
+4 pp  Multiple credible reports of ≥10 k rallies already occurring in Feb–Mar 2025.  At least a 30 % chance Carnegie will decide the “start date” of the impeachment-removal protest cycle as Feb 2025 rather than Dec 2024.  
+3 pp  Two well-known protest “holidays” (1 May labour, 18 May democracy) fall inside the window.  
Downward / uncertainty  
-2 pp  Risk that Carnegie either (a) never logs these events or (b) logs them after the 1 July cut-off.  
-1 pp  Seasonality somewhat disfavouring May/Jun for first-time entries.  

Net shift: +10 pp → 22 %. I round to 25 % to reflect asymmetric upside: one genuinely new 10 k+ campaign is enough to resolve “Yes”.

Probability calibration
My inside-view final estimate: 25 %.  In words, “roughly one time in four the Carnegie tracker will show a new South-Korean protest of ≥10 000 that begins between now and 1 July 2025 (or is retrospectively coded as beginning after the question’s launch)”.

Checklist:
1.  Will Carnegie Global Protest Tracker list any South-Korean protest ≥10 k that starts after question launch and before 1 Jul 2025?  
2.  Base rate 12 % (λ=0.5 / yr).  
3.  “25 out of 100 times, the criterion is met.” – plausible given evidence.  
4.  Key evidence: (i) Feb–Mar rallies 30–300 k; (ii) snap presidential election in June; (iii) history of tracker logging new Korean protests every ~2 yrs; (iv) update lag <10 weeks.  
5.  Blind-spot: Carnegie later elects to split off a mid-June election-day protest with start date 20 Jun 2025, which I under-weighted.  Would push probability higher.  
6.  Status-quo (no new entry) still likeliest; short window and coding ambiguity argue modest reversion toward baseline.

Probability: 25%
Predicted Probability: 25.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

I'll briefly evaluate each source for quality, recency, and factual content:

**Yonhap News Agency (Aug 2020)**: Reliable Korean news source reporting factually on a 20,000-person conservative protest. While high-quality, it's from 2020, offering historical context rather than current predictive value.

**Swarthmore NVDB on 2016-17 Candlelight Revolution**: Academic database providing detailed factual documentation of the massive protests (up to 2.32 million participants) that led to Park Geun-hye's impeachment. High-quality historical reference point.

**Swarthmore NVDB on 2008 US beef protests**: Academic documentation of multiple 10,000+ participant protests over economic policy. Demonstrates South Koreans' willingness to mobilize over various issues.

**Korea JoongAng Daily (Dec 2024)**: Recent reporting (5 months ago) on nationwide candlelight vigils against President Yoon after martial law declaration, including a 10,000-person rally in Seoul. Factually reports organizer and police estimates.

**The Moscow Times (Oct 2024)**: Reports on North Korean troops being sent to Russia. Factually presents information from South Korean intelligence sources. Limited relevance to domestic protest likelihood.

**AskNews articles (Jan-May 2025)**: Multiple recent reports including:
- May 1, 2025: Reports of 2,500 people at labor rights rally in Daegu
- May 1, 2025: Dueling protests in Seoul over Constitutional Court verdict on Lee Jae-myung
- March 2025: Large protests regarding Yoon's impeachment with estimates of 150,000 participants
- February 2025: Massive protests with competing turnout claims (organizers: 3 million; police: 35,000-38,000)
- January 2025: 35,000 people protesting in support of Yoon

These recent sources establish factual patterns of protest activity, though exact numbers vary between police and organizer estimates.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **Recent large-scale protests**: Multiple independent sources document protests exceeding 10,000 participants in early 2025 (January-March), demonstrating both capability and willingness to mobilize.
- **Constitutional election requirement**: President Yoon appears to have been removed in April 2025, triggering a constitutional requirement for elections within 60 days (by early June), which falls within our forecast period.
- **Established protest infrastructure**: The 2016-17 Candlelight Revolution demonstrated South Korea's robust protest organization capacity, with multiple civic groups able to rapidly coordinate demonstrations.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Ongoing political polarization**: Recent protests show continued sharp divisions between pro-Yoon and anti-Yoon factions, with both sides demonstrating ability to mobilize thousands.
- **Multiple potential triggers**: The timeframe includes Labor Day, presidential campaigning, election day, court decisions on political figures, and post-election government formation.
- **Historical frequency**: South Korea historically experiences 1-2 protests exceeding 10,000 participants annually, with higher frequency during political crises and elections.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Recent 2,500-person labor protest**: While below threshold, this Daegu protest (smaller city) suggests ongoing labor activism that could scale larger in Seoul.
- **International tensions**: North Korea-Russia military cooperation could potentially trigger nationalist protests, though connection is indirect.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is May 1, 2025, to July 1, 2025 (61 days). 

Critically, this period encompasses:
- The constitutionally-mandated presidential election (required by early June 2025)
- The entire campaign period leading up to this election
- The immediate post-election period during which a new government will form

If the timeframe were halved (30-31 days), the probability would decrease moderately as we might miss either the election itself or post-election protests. If doubled (122 days), the probability would increase slightly as it would include more potential trigger events and the full implementation of new policies by the incoming administration.

## (d) Justification

Several factors significantly increase the probability above the historical baseline rate:

1. **Special election circumstances**: This is not a regular election but one triggered by impeachment, which historically generates heightened civic engagement and protest. The 2016-17 precedent saw massive sustained protests during a similar impeachment-triggered election period.

2. **Recent protest activity**: Multiple sources confirm protests exceeding 10,000 participants already occurred multiple times in early 2025, establishing both capability and momentum.

3. **Sharp political polarization**: The impeachment of President Yoon has created deep societal divisions, with passionate supporters and opponents already demonstrating willingness to mobilize in large numbers.

4. **Multiple high-profile triggers**: Beyond the election itself, the timeframe includes potential court decisions on political figures, campaign events, and the formation of a new government - each representing a potential protest catalyst.

5. **Global Protest Tracker reporting likelihood**: Given that recent Korean protests have received international attention and coverage, it's highly likely that any 10,000+ person protest would be captured by the tracker.

# Probability calibration

Starting with an outside view based on historical patterns, South Korea typically experiences 1-2 protests exceeding 10,000 participants annually, which would translate to roughly 25-30% probability in a random two-month period.

However, this is not a random period - it encompasses a special presidential election triggered by impeachment. The last such period (2016-17) saw weekly protests exceeding our threshold. Combined with:
- Recent evidence of multiple 10,000+ protests already occurring in 2025
- The certainty of a presidential election within our timeframe
- Documented sharp political divisions
- Multiple potential triggers beyond just the election

I assess the probability at 83%. This reflects that in approximately 83 out of 100 similar two-month periods containing a post-impeachment presidential election in South Korea, at least one protest exceeding 10,000 participants would occur and be captured by a global tracker.

## Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase**: Will Global Protest Tracker report a South Korean protest with 10,000+ participants between May 1-July 1, 2025?
2. **Base rate**: 25-30% for random two-month period; 75%+ for election periods
3. **Consistency**: In 83/100 similar post-impeachment election periods, a 10,000+ protest would occur
4. **Key evidence**: Post-impeachment election by June; multiple 10,000+ protests already in 2025; established protest infrastructure; sharp political divisions
5. **Blind spot**: Sudden national unity candidate or external security crisis might reduce protest likelihood
6. **Status quo**: Current pattern is frequent large protests during political transition periods

Probability: 83%
Predicted Probability: 83.0%

   - **Quality**: Academic database with cited sources
   - **Content**: Details protests leading to President Park's impeachment with massive participation (~2.3 million peak)
   - **Factual vs. Opinion**: Timeline and participation numbers are factual; "celebration of democracy" reflects movement framing

3. **Swarthmore NVDB (2008 US Beef Protests)**
   - **Quality**: Academic database with multiple cited sources
   - **Content**: Documents protests with 10,000+ initial participants, later growing to 100,000+
   - **Factual vs. Opinion**: Crowd estimates from cited news agencies are factual; impact claims are analytical

4. **Korea JoongAng Daily (Dec. 2024)**
   - **Quality**: Major Korean newspaper (English edition)
   - **Content**: Reports nationwide candlelight vigils after Yoon's martial law declaration; 10,000 in Seoul (organizer estimate)
   - **Factual vs. Opinion**: Typical discrepancy between organizer (10,000) and police (2,000) estimates

5. **Moscow Times (Oct. 2024)**
   - **Quality**: Independent English-language Russian newspaper
   - **Content**: Reports on North Korean troops sent to Russia
   - **Relevance**: Low - potential security concern but not directly related to protests

### Current Information (Asknews Articles, April-May 2025)
6. **Daegu Labor Day Rally (May 1, 2025)**
   - **Quality**: Newsis (major Korean news agency)
   - **Content**: Reports 2,500 people at labor rights rally in Daegu today
   - **Relevance**: High - shows active protests happening now, though below 10,000 threshold

7. **Lee Jae-myung Constitutional Court Case (May 1, 2025)**
   - **Quality**: Newsis
   - **Content**: Reports protests in Seoul around Lee's case with police deploying 780 officers
   - **Relevance**: High - indicates ongoing political tension and active protests

8. **Seoul Protests Planning (April 30, 2025)**
   - **Quality**: Newsis
   - **Content**: Lists various protests scheduled for May 1st in Seoul
   - **Relevance**: High - indicates multiple coordinated protests planned for today

9. **Massive Protests (March 21, 2025)**
   - **Quality**: Maeil Business Newspaper (major Korean publication)
   - **Content**: Reports police expectation of 320,000 protesters for weekend rallies on impeachment
   - **Relevance**: High - indicates recent very large protests related to current political crisis

10. **Seoul Protests (March 3, 2025)**
    - **Quality**: Yonhap News Agency
    - **Content**: Reports 150,000 participants (police estimate) in protests for/against Yoon's impeachment
    - **Relevance**: High - confirms large recent protests exceeding 10,000 threshold

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
1. **Recent large protests confirmed**: Police estimates from March 2025 (150,000 protesters) and February 2025 (38,000) establish a clear pattern of large mobilizations following Yoon's impeachment.

2. **Historical precedent established**: The 2016-2017 Candlelight Revolution demonstrates South Korea's capacity for sustained large-scale protests (weekly rallies of 1+ million people).

3. **Institutional factors - election timing**: The Constitutional Court removed Yoon on April 4, 2025, triggering a mandatory presidential election by early June 2025 (within our forecast window).

### Moderate Evidence
1. **Active protest environment**: Today's confirmed protests across multiple cities show ongoing mobilization, though the only specific figure (2,500 in Daegu) is below threshold.

2. **Political polarization**: Multiple sources confirm strong divisions between pro-Yoon and anti-Yoon factions, with both sides actively mobilizing.

3. **Labor activism**: Labor Day protests today demonstrate continued activism on economic issues, which historically can generate large turnouts.

### Weak Evidence
1. **Organizer estimates**: Claims from protest organizers (e.g., "10,000 participants") are typically inflated compared to police estimates.

2. **Protest fatigue speculation**: Some expert opinions suggest potential "protest fatigue" after months of demonstrations, but this lacks empirical support.

## Timeframe Analysis
- Prediction timeframe: May 1, 2025 - July 1, 2025 (61 days)
- Key events within timeframe:
  * Today (May 1, 2025): Labor Day protests occurring across South Korea
  * By early June 2025: Mandatory presidential election following Yoon's removal
  * Constitutional Court verdict on Lee Jae-myung's case (date unknown)

If the timeframe were halved (30 days), my prediction would increase moderately because the election period would constitute a larger proportion of the forecast window.

If the timeframe were doubled (120 days), my prediction would increase substantially because it would capture both the election period and potential post-election protests depending on the outcome.

## Justification
Starting from the outside view base rate of 56%, I adjust based on several compelling factors:

1. **Upcoming presidential election** (+15%): Elections reliably trigger large demonstrations in South Korea, especially contentious ones following impeachment. The election must occur within our forecast period (by early June).

2. **Recent demonstration patterns** (+10%): Multiple protests exceeding 10,000 participants have occurred in February-March 2025, establishing a pattern of large mobilizations in the current political environment.

3. **Active protest environment** (+5%): Today's protests across multiple cities demonstrate continued mobilization capacity, even if individual events are below threshold.

4. **Protest fatigue possibility** (-5%): After months of demonstrations since December 2024, some reduction in participation might occur.

5. **Post-election normalization** (-5%): If the election proceeds smoothly in early June, the latter part of our window might see reduced protest activity.

# Probability Calibration
Starting with the outside view base rate of 56%, the adjustments above would yield a raw probability of 76%. However, to avoid overconfidence and account for potential overlap in factors, I'll reduce the total adjustment to +14%.

My calibrated inside view probability is therefore 70%.

# Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase**: Will the Global Protest Tracker report any South Korean protests with 10,000+ participants between May 1-July 1, 2025?
2. **Base rate**: 56% chance based on historical patterns of South Korean protests during political crises.
3. **Consistency**: In 70 of 100 similar situations with upcoming elections after impeachment, South Korea would see at least one 10,000+ protest within two months.
4. **Key evidence**: Mandatory presidential election by early June; confirmed 150,000-person protest in March; continued active protests today; strong partisan polarization.
5. **Blind spot**: The election could occur early and be accepted by all parties, leading to rapid normalization.
6. **Status quo**: The current environment includes regular large protests; given the 2-month window and upcoming election, continuity of this pattern is likely.

Probability: 70%
Predicted Probability: 70.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase & Resolution  
Will the Carnegie Endowment’s Global Protest Tracker record at least one protest in South Korea with 10,000+ participants whose start date falls between May 1, 2025 and July 1, 2025?  

2. Outside-View Base Rate  
Since 2010, South Korea has averaged about 1–2 protests per year with 10,000+ participants (≈20–40% annual chance), with higher frequency in years of political crisis.  

3. Source Analysis  
a. Perplexity “Major Protests since 2010” (compiled 2024)  
 • Lists multiple 10k+ protests in 2024–25: Climate Justice (30k+), Impeachment rallies (up to 600k in March 2025).  
 • Quality: Comprehensive, well-sourced; strong evidence of current high protest frequency.  

b. Korea Herald (Feb 16, 2025)  
 • Reports 30k anti-impeachment and 10–20k pro-impeachment in Gwangju.  
 • Quality: Established outlet; clear, attributable figures.  

c. DW on Women in Protests (Dec 2024)  
 • Notes immediate large mobilizations after martial-law order, 40% women.  
 • Quality: Reputable; expert commentary (Hyobin Lee).  

d. Asknews (Jan–May 2025 South Korea protests)  
 • Jan–Mar 2025: multiple protests in Seoul & major cities, e.g., Mar 1: 600k, Feb 1: 38k police estimate (organizers 3 million), Feb 22: 300k in Seoul, 20k in Daejeon.  
 • Apr 30–May 1: mass Labor Day rallies scheduled (expected tens of thousands).  
 • Quality: Mix of local wire services (Yonhap, Newsis), generally reliable for turnout estimates.  

4. Evidence Weighing  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
 • Perplexity report & Korea Herald confirm protests >10k as recent as Mar 2025 (Strong).  
 • Constitutional crisis + looming snap election → proven mobilization triggers (Strong).  
 • Labor Day holiday tradition of candlelight/labor rallies >10k (Strong).  

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
 • DW’s gender-in-protests detail — shows broad base but not turnout size (Moderate).  

Weak evidence (small shifts):  
 • Anecdotal or single-day reporting discrepancies between organizer vs. police counts (Weak).  

5. Timeframe Analysis  
Forecast window is ~60 days.  
• If window were halved (~30 days), still covers May 1 Labor Day and pre-election campaigning → probability remains high (~90%).  
• If window were doubled (~120 days), covers election aftermath → probability would approach ~98–99%.  

6. Justification & Inside View Adjustment  
Reference-class baseline: ~20–40% chance per year → ~5–10% in any two-month slice under normal conditions.  
Adjustments:  
• Ongoing constitutional crisis with massive, sustained protests since December 2024.  
• Snap presidential election mandated by early June 2025—precedent shows elections spark large rallies.  
• Historical pattern: political crises + symbolic anniversaries (June Democracy Movement) → additional mobilization.  
• Imminent Labor Day (May 1) rallies routinely exceed 10k in Seoul and other cities.  

Given multiple, overlapping mobilization drivers and demonstrated turnout well above 10k in recent months, I raise the forecast from a 5–10% baseline to a very high probability.  

Probability calibration  
I estimate ~95% that the Global Protest Tracker will record at least one 10,000+-participant protest in South Korea between May 1 and July 1, 2025.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase & resolution aligned.  
2. Base rate ~20–40% yearly; adjusted for crisis & holiday.  
3. “95 out of 100 times, we see ≥10k protests in this window.”  
4. Key evidence:  
 – March 1, 2025: 600k→shows capacity;  
 – Feb 2025 dual rallies 10–30k;  
 – May 1 Labor Day tradition >10k;  
 – Snap election + crisis → proven trigger.  
5. Blind spot: Crisis abruptly resolves (e.g., caretaker government quells dissent) → could reduce turnout.  
6. Status quo: High volatility & sustained protest → supports Yes.

Probability: 95%
Predicted Probability: 95.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase & Resolution  
We’re forecasting whether the Global Protest Tracker will report a South Korean protest of ≥10,000 people that starts between May 1, 2025 and July 1, 2025.  

2. Source analysis  
- Historical protest catalogs (Perplexity report, NVDB, Wikipedia): Aggregate data on large protests since 2010. Generally reliable for dates and crowd‐size estimates; some minor inconsistencies but overall good coverage.  
- Yonhap/Korea Herald/CNN/AFP articles on specific protests (2016–17 Candlelight, 2008 beef, 2024 martial-law rallies): High‐quality, named sources with police vs. organizer figures. Factual turnout data are solid.  
- AskNews articles (May 1 2025): Multiple Newsis and Yonhap pieces show May 1 labor‐day events in Daegu (~2,500) and scattered ≤10,000 “candlelight” or election-related gatherings in Seoul, but none ≥10,000 starting after May 1. These sources are timely and credible for May 1 reporting.  

3. Outside view base rate  
From Jan 2010–Mar 2025, roughly 22 two-month windows out of ~182 featured a ≥10,000 protest in SK ⇒ base rate ≈12%.  

4. Evidence weighting  
Strong (historical pattern): Large protests in South Korea occur in clustered episodes around major scandals (e.g., 2016–17, 2019, early 2025 impeachment crisis).  
Moderate (current trends): Snap presidential election campaign expected in June 2025 could spur demonstrations, but campaign rallies ≠ protests and so far no major mobilizing grievance is publicized.  
Weak (anecdotal): Smaller labor and civic rallies (May 1 Daegu) underline ongoing activism but well below 10,000.  

5. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window = ~2 months. If halved (1 month), probability would roughly halve to ~7%. If doubled (4 months), probability would rise toward ~25% given more opportunities and historical clustering.  

6. Inside‐view justification & shift  
- Base rate ~12%.  
- Snap election context adds some risk (+3 points) because contested elections can trigger protests if there’s a disputed outcome or controversial policies, though no current flashpoints.  
- Lack of any announced mass‐mobilization campaign or new crisis tempers the bump.  

Inside‐view adjustment: 12% + 3% = 15%.  

Probability calibration  
I estimate about a 15% chance that the Global Protest Tracker will report a protest of 10,000+ participants in South Korea starting before July 1, 2025.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast of ≥10,000‐person protest in SK during May–June 2025.  
2. Base rate: ~12% for any random 2-month window historically.  
3. Consistency: “In 15 out of 100 comparable 2-month spans, SK has a ≥10k protest,” aligned with my 15% forecast.  
4. Top evidences:  
   - Historical frequency of 10k+ protests (strong).  
   - Upcoming snap election (moderate).  
   - No current large‐scale grievance (weak).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden economic crisis or foreign policy shock (e.g., military incident with North Korea) could spark a ≥10k protest, making this forecast too low.  
6. Status quo: SK protest activity has dropped from early 2025 highs; absent new catalysts, status quo favors no 10k event.  

Probability: 15%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Yonhap Aug-2020, NVDB 2008 & 2016-17 entries – reliable, give historical scale & cadence of Korean mass protests; opinion separated from factual crowd counts.  
• Korea JoongAng Daily 5 Dec 2024 – mainstream national daily, photographs; organiser put Seoul crowd at 10 000. Facts (locations, policing) solid; numbers still organiser-side.  
• Asknews compilation (Jan–May 2025) – mix of NEWSIS, MK, Yonhap, KBS, etc. All mainstream Korean outlets dated within the last three months. They repeatedly quote police logistics data (mobile units deployed, traffic diversions) plus organiser/police turnout estimates (from 35 000 up to “300 000”).  These are factual enough for “size >10 000” but do not tell us how Carnegie will code them.  
Overall, most items are timely, come from wire services or major papers and carry verifiable crowd figures → moderate-to-high source quality.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong  
• Persistently very large impeachment-related rallies in Feb–Mar 2025 (organisers claim 0.3–3 million; police concede 30 000-150 000).  
• Forthcoming extraordinary presidential election (late-June) – historically increases protest likelihood (2002, 2012 truckers, 2017 candlelight).  
Moderate  
• Labour-movement tradition of 1 May and 18 May (Gwangju) rallies; most years remain below 10 k but occasionally exceed.  
• Carnegie tracker update lag is typically 3-10 weeks – still enough time for a new May/June protest to be logged before 1 July.  
Weak  
• Seasonality: Korean mega-protests peak Oct–Dec, making May/Jun somewhat less likely.  
• Possible “lumping” risk – Carnegie may treat all impeachment-related street actions as one campaign that started Dec 2024 (pre-question), meaning new rallies would not be a fresh entry.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
61 days remain.  If the window were doubled to four months I would raise the probability by roughly 1.6× (lag room + more potential triggers). If it were halved to one month I would cut the probability by about one-third because (i) election trigger disappears and (ii) Carnegie update lag could miss late-May events.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (Poisson with λ≈0.5 big new protests / year) → 12 %.  
Upward adjustments  
+6 pp  Elevated political crisis: sitting president removed; snap election in June – historically fertile ground for new, distinct protest campaigns.  
+4 pp  Multiple credible reports of ≥10 k rallies already occurring in Feb–Mar 2025.  At least a 30 % chance Carnegie will decide the “start date” of the impeachment-removal protest cycle as Feb 2025 rather than Dec 2024.  
+3 pp  Two well-known protest “holidays” (1 May labour, 18 May democracy) fall inside the window.  
Downward / uncertainty  
-2 pp  Risk that Carnegie either (a) never logs these events or (b) logs them after the 1 July cut-off.  
-1 pp  Seasonality somewhat disfavouring May/Jun for first-time entries.  

Net shift: +10 pp → 22 %. I round to 25 % to reflect asymmetric upside: one genuinely new 10 k+ campaign is enough to resolve “Yes”.

Probability calibration
My inside-view final estimate: 25 %.  In words, “roughly one time in four the Carnegie tracker will show a new South-Korean protest of ≥10 000 that begins between now and 1 July 2025 (or is retrospectively coded as beginning after the question’s launch)”.

Checklist:
1.  Will Carnegie Global Protest Tracker list any South-Korean protest ≥10 k that starts after question launch and before 1 Jul 2025?  
2.  Base rate 12 % (λ=0.5 / yr).  
3.  “25 out of 100 times, the criterion is met.” – plausible given evidence.  
4.  Key evidence: (i) Feb–Mar rallies 30–300 k; (ii) snap presidential election in June; (iii) history of tracker logging new Korean protests every ~2 yrs; (iv) update lag <10 weeks.  
5.  Blind-spot: Carnegie later elects to split off a mid-June election-day protest with start date 20 Jun 2025, which I under-weighted.  Would push probability higher.  
6.  Status-quo (no new entry) still likeliest; short window and coding ambiguity argue modest reversion toward baseline.

Probability: 25%
Predicted Probability: 25.0%...
