Analysis:
The key to building an outside‐view baseline is to catalog prior instances when the U.S. publicly accused Russia of sending ground forces into a sovereign state without invitation. Major cases include Georgia (2008), Crimea (2014), and Russia’s intervention in Syria (2015). By identifying all such episodes, including their contexts and official U.S. statements, we can assess how often and under what conditions Washington labels Kremlin actions as “invasion.” This frequency and pattern constitute our base‐rate benchmark. We can then adjust for current geopolitical drivers (e.g., Moscow’s posture toward the Baltics or Central Asia) to refine our inside‐view probability for a new accusation before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:
The key information needed to assess whether the US is likely to publicly accuse Russia of invading another country before July 1, 2025 hinges on two things: 1) evidence of any new Russian ground-force incursions (or build-ups poised to cross borders without consent) outside Ukraine, and 2) official US government statements or intelligence assessments flagging such activity as an “invasion.” Historically, the only comparable accusation was for Georgia in 2008. Today the most plausible flashpoints would be in Africa—where Russian mercenary forces (Wagner) have deployed in Mali, the Central African Republic and elsewhere—or renewed pressure on the Caucasus or Central Asian states. We need to know if the US State Department or White House has recently labeled any of these deployments as an invasion, or if there are credible media reports or intelligence leaks suggesting such a label is imminent.

Key facts and figures
• In early August 2008, Russian forces routed the Georgian military in a five-day war over South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  
• Russia now garrisons almost 8,000 troops in the two breakaway regions.  
• The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) had agreement to send 100 military observers to Georgia but only eight are on the ground—and none have been allowed into South Ossetia since the conflict.  

US accusations and diplomacy  
• US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice publicly accused President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin of “aggression and authoritarianism” and said their “primary war aim” was to overthrow Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili.  
• Rice warned Russia that its choices were putting it on “a one-way path to self-imposed isolation and international irrelevance.”  
• She cited Russia’s use of energy as a political weapon, threats to target Poland and the Czech Republic with nuclear weapons, and withdrawal from arms-control treaties as part of a broader pattern of aggression.  

Failed OSCE negotiations  
• Talks in Vienna collapsed after Russia stiffened terms to bar any international monitors from South Ossetia.  
• Finland, then OSCE president, said there was “no basis for consensus” and “no point in continuing negotiations.”  

EU peace-monitoring plan  
• French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Moscow agreed to deploy 200 EU monitors by month’s end—but under Russian terms they will be confined to a “buffer zone” outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  
• EU officials (France, Germany, Italy) will supply 140 of the monitors; Britain will provide 20.  
• US and NATO sources offered muted criticism that the EU plan was too lenient, but an EU official countered: “Without the EU, you don’t get the Russians out [of Georgia]. The Americans cannot be part of the solution here.”

Disclaimer: Summary is based solely on the provided CSIS paper and does not include external information.

• 2008 August War background  
  – In August 2008, Russian troops invaded Georgia, seizing full control of South Ossetia (Tskhinvali region) and Abkhazia—together ~20% of Georgian territory.  
  – Russia repeatedly violated the six-point ceasefire mediated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.  
  – Moscow uses these occupied regions as military bases, denying international monitors access.

• Shift to “hybrid aggression”  
  – After 2008, Russia moved from overt conventional operations to subtler, cost-efficient tools aimed at pulling Georgia back into Russia’s sphere of influence.  
  – Key hybrid tactics (“borderization” and other coercive measures):  
     1. Militarizing occupied zones (modern offensive weapons, troop deployments near Georgia’s main east-west highway and critical infrastructure such as pipelines).  
     2. “Borderization”: illegal fencing, barbed wire, border markers pushing the Administrative Boundary Line deeper into Georgian villages (e.g., Tsitelubani), dividing families and harming civilians.  
     3. Political warfare:  
        – Discredit the West in Georgian public opinion.  
        – Empower radical nationalist and pro-Kremlin groups inside Georgia.  
        – Portray Georgia as too unstable to join the West.

• Scale of military activity  
  – According to the Georgian State Security Service, Russia’s Southern Military District conducted over 120 exercises in 2020 on the 4th and 7th military bases in the occupied regions.  
  – Russia maintains Federal Security Service (FSB) forces on the ground, despite officially portraying occupied territories as “independent.”

• Legal and diplomatic context  
  – The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia exercises “effective control” over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, making it a party to the conflict and invalidating Moscow’s claims of non-involvement.  
  – Most of the international community upholds Georgia’s non-recognition policy toward the two regions.

• Georgia’s pro-Western trajectory and public opinion  
  – Despite the 2008 war’s devastation, Georgia’s commitment to Euro-Atlantic integration has strengthened:  
     • 2021 National Democratic Institute poll: 80% support EU membership (up from 76% in 2020); 74% support NATO integration (up from 69%).  
  – Georgia and the United States/NATO have deepened strategic partnership, including equipment provision and joint training aimed at NATO standards.

• Kremlin’s strategic calculus  
  – Moscow views Georgia’s democratic consolidation and Euro-Atlantic ties as a direct challenge to its authoritarian model.  
  – NATO’s 2008 Bucharest summit pledge to consider Georgia (and Ukraine) for future membership—without granting a Membership Action Plan—left Georgia without security guarantees, facilitating Russia’s 2008 offensive.  
  – Overt aggression failed to reverse Georgian public support for the West, prompting Russia’s turn to hybrid methods as a long-term, lower-cost strategy.

Summary of “Iran blames US and Ukraine for Syrian rebels’ advances” (Newsweek, Dec. 6, 2024)

• Iran’s allegation (via Mehr News Agency)  
  – Mojtaba Damirchiloo, aide to Iran’s foreign minister, accused the U.S. and Ukraine of supporting “terrorism” in Syria.  
  – He claimed some Ukrainian officials received U.S. weapons and supplied them to terrorist groups (Takfiri militants) fighting the Assad regime.  
  – Described this as an “illegal trade of weapons” and a “blatant violation of international commitments related to the prevention and combat of terrorism,” calling for an immediate end.  
  – Newsweek has contacted Damirchiloo for comment; no response quoted in the article.

• Recent rebel advances in Syria  
  – Syrian insurgents, led by Hayʾat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, captured the central city of Hama after government forces withdrew.  
  – This followed opposition fighters taking control of much of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city.  
  – In response, Syrian government deployed additional troops and launched airstrikes to retake lost ground.

• Russia’s role in Syria  
  – Russia has supported Bashar al-Assad since 2011, formally intervening in 2015.  
  – The U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies says Russia provided “decisive air power” to Syrian and Iranian-backed ground forces, helping Assad regain territory.

• Connection to the Ukraine war  
  – William Freer, research fellow at the U.K. Council on Geostrategy, told Newsweek: “Any level of Russian political, economic, or military bandwidth which is diverted from the conflict against Ukraine is beneficial to Ukraine. The impact however will likely be extremely limited. The fighting in Ukraine is too important to the Kremlin.”  
  – (Named, reliable source.)

• Hamas’s stance  
  – Basem Naim, spokesperson and Political Bureau member for Hamas, told Newsweek: “This is not our battle. Our battle is with the Zionist occupation, and our first goal is to liberate our country from colonialism.”

<Summary source="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg304d1w9v4o">
A Syrian man, supported by the Open Society Justice Initiative and other human-rights groups, has filed a complaint with the UN Human Rights Committee accusing the Russian air force of deliberately bombing Kafranbel Surgical Hospital in opposition-held Idlib province on 5 May 2019. Key points:

Facts and evidence  
• According to detailed evidence submitted to the committee:  
  – The hospital was hit four times in 20 minutes.  
  – Local flight-spotters reported seeing a Russian fighter jet depart from Russia’s Hmeimim airbase (60 km west).  
  – An alleged audio recording captures the pilot confirming successful strikes to Russian ground control. The timing of the communications matches videos of the hospital being bombed.  
  – Two brothers who worked at the hospital (and were cousins of the complainant) were killed.  
• Russia began its air campaign in support of President Assad’s government in 2015 and has repeatedly denied targeting medical facilities.  
• The UN’s own investigators have documented widespread possible war crimes by Russian and Syrian forces, including indiscriminate bombing.  
• On the same day in May 2019, three other hospitals in Syria were reportedly hit by Russian planes; separate reports cite attacks on health facilities in Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza.

Legal mechanism  
• The complaint uses an individual-petition procedure under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Russia is a party.  
• The UN Human Rights Committee can decide whether Russia violated the ICCPR and issue recommendations (e.g. to open a criminal inquiry or provide compensation), but it cannot impose prosecutions.  
• Neither Russia nor Syria accepts the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court; UN Security Council referrals have been vetoed by Russia.

Opinions from named sources  
• Open Society Justice Initiative: “It is the first time Russia is held to account… over violations committed in Syria.”  
• Human-rights experts (unnamed) note that while formal prosecutions are rare, recognition of war-crime violations by bodies like the UN committee can serve as a form of justice and a deterrent to future attacks on medical facilities.

Less-reliable or indirect sources  
• Flight-spotter reports and the alleged audio recording have not been independently verified beyond the complainant’s submission to the UN committee.

<Perplexity_report>
Query: Provide a comprehensive list of every occasion on which the U.S. government publicly accused Russia of invading a country other than Ukraine, including year, country, context, and details of the official statements.
The United States government has formally accused Russia of military invasions in sovereign nations on several occasions beyond the 2022 Ukraine conflict. Below is a comprehensive analysis of each documented instance, supported by official statements and historical records.

---

### 1. **2008 Invasion of Georgia**

**Year:** 2008  
**Country:** Georgia  
**Context:** Russia intervened militarily in Georgia’s breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, following skirmishes between Georgian forces and South Ossetian separatists. The conflict escalated into a five-day war, with Russian troops advancing beyond the disputed territories into undisputed Georgian regions, including Gori and the east-west highway connecting Tbilisi to the Black Sea[1][2][13].  

**U.S. Government Accusations:**  
- **August 8, 2008**: Senator Barack Obama (then-presidential candidate) condemned Russia’s actions, stating, *“Russian military forces invaded Georgia. I condemn Russia's aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire”*[8].  
- **August 11, 2008**: Senator John McCain called for a UN Security Council resolution condemning *“Russian aggression”* and urged NATO to reconsider its relationship with Russia, noting that withholding a Membership Action Plan for Georgia might have emboldened Moscow[14].  
- **August 12, 2008**: The U.S. State Department issued a statement emphasizing *“Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity”* and condemned Russia’s use of strategic bombers and missiles, which threatened civilian lives[16].  
- **2023–2024**: The State Department reiterated its stance, calling on Russia to adhere to the 2008 EU-brokered ceasefire and withdraw forces from Georgia. A 2024 statement stressed, *“Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and continues to occupy 20% of its territory”*[15][18].  

---

### 2. **2015–Present Military Intervention in Syria**

**Year:** 2015–Present  
**Country:** Syria  
**Context:** Russia launched airstrikes in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism, bolstering the Bashar al-Assad regime during the Syrian Civil War. The campaign expanded Russia’s military footprint, including the establishment of permanent bases and alleged coordination with Syrian forces in attacks on civilian infrastructure[9][11][12].  

**U.S. Government Accusations:**  
- **2016**: The U.S. condemned Russia’s targeting of hospitals and civilian areas. While not explicitly using the term “invasion,” Secretary of State John Kerry accused Russia of *“war crimes”* for its role in indiscriminate bombings[11].  
- **2018**: Following a suspected chemical attack in Douma, the U.S. retaliated with missile strikes and criticized Russia’s military support for Assad. President Donald Trump’s administration framed Russia’s actions as enabling *“a brutal dictatorship’s chemical weapons attacks on civilians”*[4].  
- **2022**: President Joe Biden’s administration linked Russia’s Syria playbook to its Ukraine strategy, noting parallels in *“disinformation campaigns and disregard for civilian lives”*[9].  

**Nuanced Terminology:**  
The U.S. avoided labeling Syria as a formal “invasion” but consistently denounced Russia’s unilateral military operations. For example, a 2025 State Department response to Russian disinformation in Syria emphasized *“Moscow’s destabilizing role in propping up authoritarian regimes through force”*[9].  

---

### 3. **Hybrid Engagement in Other Regions**

While not direct invasions, the U.S. has accused Russia of undermining sovereignty through proxy forces and cyber operations:  

#### **Transnistria, Moldova**  
**Year:** Ongoing since 1992  
**Context:** Russia maintains troops in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria, termed a “peacekeeping” mission. The U.S. has criticized this presence as a violation of Moldova’s territorial integrity, though without explicit “invasion” rhetoric[2][7].  

#### **Cybersecurity and Election Interference**  
**Year:** 2016–Present  
**Context:** The U.S. Intelligence Community has accused Russia of cyber invasions targeting democratic processes, including the 2016 U.S. elections. While not a physical invasion, these acts were framed as *“unprecedented attacks on American sovereignty”*[4][17].  

---

### Analysis of U.S. Rhetorical Patterns  
1. **Georgia 2008**: The clearest example of the U.S. using “invasion” terminology, citing territorial violations and civilian harm[1][8][14].  
2. **Syria 2015–Present**: Condemnation focused on military overreach and human rights violations, avoiding formal “invasion” labeling but emphasizing unlawful intervention[9][11].  
3. **Other Incursions**: The U.S. prioritizes diplomatic terms like “occupation” or “aggression” for actions in Moldova and cyber domains, reserving “invasion” for large-scale troop movements[7][17].  

---

### Conclusion  
The U.S. government has explicitly accused Russia of invasion solely in the 2008 Georgia conflict, employing unequivocal language to condemn troop incursions and occupation. In Syria, accusations centered on military overreach and human rights abuses without formal invasion claims. Other engagements, such as in Moldova or cyberspace, received narrower critiques. This pattern reflects strategic rhetorical restraint, reserving “invasion” for cases involving direct territorial annexation or prolonged occupation.

Disclaimer: Extraction is limited to the provided RUSI article and may not capture every nuance.

Key facts and timeline
• In August 2008, during the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony, President Bush met Putin as Russian forces clashed with Georgian troops in South Ossetia.  
• Over five days, the US:
  – Repeatedly called Georgia “a staunch American ally.”  
  – Condemned Russia’s “disproportionate response” and bombing “outside” South Ossetia.  
  – Pledged humanitarian aid but ruled out US military intervention.  
• Georgia’s president, Mikhail Saakashvili, publicly demanded more decisive Western support, likening his appeal to a de facto NATO guarantee.

Official US positions and reactions  
• George W. Bush:  
  – Accused Russia of invading “a sovereign neighbouring state” and threatening a “democratic government.”  
  – Maintained a cautious diplomatic tone, avoiding any commitment to military force.  
• Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice:  
  – Conducted roughly ninety calls to broker a ceasefire.  
  – Emphasized humanitarian assistance over military options.  
• Senator John McCain (R-AZ):  
  – Warned President Medvedev and Putin of “severe, long-term negative consequences” for US–Europe relations.  
  – Called Russia’s actions a “clear violation of international law.”  
  – Urged Rice to forge a “common Euro-Atlantic position” to end the war and back Georgian independence.  
• Senator Barack Obama (D-IL):  
  – Condemned the conflict and demanded an immediate ceasefire.  
  – Noted that “no matter how this conflict started, Russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over South Ossetia and has now violated the space of another country.”

Nuances and implications  
• Both Bush and Obama implicitly distinguished between Georgia proper and its breakaway regions, a subtlety McCain avoided by condemning Russia’s violation of Georgian sovereignty without segmentation.  
• The crisis placed the US in a diplomatic bind:  
  – Risking damage to its credibility with Georgia and eastern European allies by offering only limited support.  
  – Potentially clashing with “old Europe” over prospects for Georgian NATO membership.  
  – Facing criticism either for provoking Russia or for appeasing it.  
• The author concludes Washington will spend months defending its policy choices and managing allied expectations.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the provided CSIS paper by Natia Seskuria (August 2021) and does not include external information.

Key facts and developments  
• 2008 August War: Russian ground forces invaded Georgia over five days, seizing full control of South Ossetia (Tskhinvali region) and Abkhazia—about 20 percent of Georgian territory—and repeatedly violated the six-point ceasefire mediated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.  
• After 2008, Russia prevented international monitors from accessing occupied regions, militarized them, and used them as leverage over Tbilisi.  
• “Borderization” (begun circa 2011–2012) involves unmarked advances of barbed wire, fence-building and border markers to push the Administrative Boundary Line deeper into Georgian-controlled areas (e.g., in 2015 into the village of Tsitelubani).  
• Occupied regions host modern offensive weapons and Russian troops near Georgia’s main east-west highway and critical oil/gas pipelines; Russia’s Southern Military District conducted over 120 exercises in 2020 on the 4th and 7th military bases there (Georgian State Security Service).  
• Since recognizing Abkhazian and South Ossetian “independence,” Russia has portrayed them as sovereign states, but the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia retains “effective control” over both and remains a party to the conflict.  

Drivers and objectives of Russia’s hybrid strategy  
1. Reverse Georgia’s pro-Western, EU/NATO orientation by discrediting the West in Georgian public opinion.  
2. Weaken Georgia internally via radical nationalist and pro-Kremlin groups.  
3. Portray Georgia as a “basket of problems” unworthy of Western partnership.  

Context and public response  
• President Vladimir Putin views Georgia as within Russia’s natural sphere of influence; NATO enlargement nearby is seen as encirclement.  
• At the 2008 NATO Bucharest summit, members pledged future membership for Georgia and Ukraine but failed to grant a Membership Action Plan, leaving Georgia without firm security guarantees.  
• Despite the 2008 invasion’s economic and political damage, Georgian public support for Euro-Atlantic integration has risen. According to a 2021 National Democratic Institute poll, 80 percent back EU membership (up from 76 percent in 2020) and 74 percent back NATO membership (up from 69 percent).  
• Georgia’s strategic partnership with the United States and NATO has deepened, including equipment provision and multinational exercises, driving Defense Forces reforms toward NATO standards.

<Summary source="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/02/us-pondered-military-use-in-georgia-032487">
Below is a summary of the POLITICO (Feb. 3, 2010) article “U.S. pondered military use in Georgia.” Facts and named-source opinions are separated; less-reliable opinions are flagged.

1. Facts and objective details  
• In August 2008, Russia invaded Georgia, sending troops through the Roki Tunnel in the Caucasus.  
• U.S. intelligence had been focused elsewhere and was surprised by the timing and scale of Russia’s moves.  
• Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili engaged separatist forces, provoking a much larger Russian military response.  
• Faced with urgent Georgian requests for help, President George W. Bush’s national-security team formally discussed military options on August 11, 2008, in a principals’ committee meeting (Bush, VP Cheney, NSA Hadley, cabinet members).  
• Proposed options included “bombardment and sealing of the Roki Tunnel” and other “surgical strikes.”  
• No principal ultimately advocated use of force; advisers judged a direct U.S.–Russia clash too risky and logistically distant.  
• Instead, the administration sent humanitarian supplies to Georgia via U.S. military aircraft—a symbolic signal that “was not lost on the Russians.” (Hadley)  
• Russia ended the campaign in control of the two breakaway Georgian provinces; NATO’s April 2008 Bucharest summit had failed to offer Georgia (and Ukraine) a clear path to membership.  

2. Opinions from reliable, named sources  
a. Ron Asmus (former Clinton-era State Dept. official; author of The Little War That Shook the World):  
   – Asserts that Hadley raised the military-action question to force an “open discussion” and record dissent.  
   – Argues Western diplomatic missteps (e.g. lack of NATO clarity on Georgia/Ukraine) signaled to Russia it could invade with impunity, setting a dangerous precedent in Europe.  

b. Stephen Hadley (National Security Adviser, 2005–2009):  
   – Confirms discussion of military options but labels them “not an attractive option.”  
   – Defends Bush administration’s handling, placing full blame on Russia for the conflict.  
   – Says the U.S. “reset” with Russia under Obama was driven by Russia’s invasion of Georgia, not by Bush policies.  

c. Damon Wilson (former NSC senior director for European affairs):  
   – Recalls an emotionally charged debate and believes “we came to the right decision” in rejecting force.  

3. Opinions from less-reliable or more subjective sources  
• Joe Wood (deputy assistant for national security affairs to Cheney):  
   – Remains unsure whether harsher military options “should have been more seriously considered.”  
   – Predicts that “in 10 to 20 years” history will judge whether U.S. restraint was wise or a missed deterrent.  

No U.S. military strike or direct combat engagement with Russian forces occurred; the article’s focus is on the internal Bush-era debate over whether to go beyond humanitarian signaling.

Here’s a concise summary of the Washington Post article by Catherine Belton (Sept. 13, 2024):

• Main claim: Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russian state broadcaster RT has evolved from a propaganda outlet into a covert arm of Russia’s intelligence apparatus, conducting cyber-intelligence, influence operations and weapons procurement to aid Russia’s war in Ukraine.

• Sanctions and designations
  – U.S. Treasury last week targeted 10 RT executives.
  – Sept. 13, the State Department imposed new sanctions on RT’s parent companies (Rossiya Segodnya and TV-Novosti) and designated RT as a “foreign mission.”
  – These actions are aimed at RT’s covert campaigns, not its editorial content.

• Diplomatic outreach
  – The U.S., U.K. and Canada will inform other governments of RT’s expanded intelligence capabilities.
  – Blinken called on “every ally, every partner” to treat RT as they would any foreign intelligence activity.
  – James P. Rubin (head of the State Department’s Global Engagement Center) compared the effort to the U.S. campaign against Huawei.

• Covert activities cited by Blinken
  – In spring 2023, Russian intelligence embedded a cyber-operations unit within RT.
  – RT is used to crowdfund weapons (sniper rifles, drones, radio gear) for Russia’s military.
  – RT is active in Moldova, seeking to subvert the upcoming presidential election by fomenting unrest in coordination with the Kremlin.
  – Across Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, RT operates via front companies and unbranded platforms.

• Illustrative examples
  – African Stream (launched Jan. 2023): purported to amplify African voices but in reality disseminates Kremlin messaging.
  – Red (German English-language outlet): promoted pro-Palestinian protests; successor to the EU-banned RT affiliate Redfish.
  – Operation Doppelgänger: U.S. shut down 32 domains run by Kremlin strategists Ilya Gambashidze and Nikolai Tupikin that cloned U.S. media sites to undermine support for Ukraine.

• Legal actions
  – The Justice Department indicted two RT employees for laundering nearly $10 million through shell companies to operate Tennessee-based Tenet Media, which posted thousands of videos sowing division in the U.S. and paid hundreds of thousands per broadcast to right-wing influencers.

• Reactions
  – Margarita Simonyan (RT’s editor in chief) on Telegram and Russian state TV mocked U.S. claims, boasting of “guerrilla” information operations in the West.
  – Fiona Hill (former NSC senior director for European and Russian affairs) called RT “a full information war” requiring concerted action, not a free-speech issue.

<Summary source="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c4g7w7521w0t">
Here is a concise extraction of the key points from the BBC News article “Russia and Ukraine agree Black Sea ceasefire, but Zelensky says Russia is lying about terms.” 

Facts and objective details  
• After weeks of fits-and-starts, the US brokered (via separate meetings in Riyadh) a limited ceasefire in the Black Sea between Russia and Ukraine.  
• Russia says its pause on attacks on energy infrastructure began on 18 March for 30 days and may be extended by mutual agreement.  
• Russia’s stated conditions for implementing the Black Sea deal include lifting sanctions on banks involved in food and fertiliser trade and full reconnection to the SWIFT payment network.  
• The Black Sea borders Ukraine (to the north), Russia (east), Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia and parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine (including Crimea). It is a vital shipping route; Ukraine’s grain exports slumped after Russia withdrew from the 2023 Black Sea Grain Initiative.  

Opinions from reliable, named sources  
• Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky:  
  – “The Kremlin is lying again, claiming that the Black Sea ceasefire supposedly depends on sanctions and that the energy ceasefire supposedly began on 18 March. Moscow always lies.”  
  – The deal represents “the right steps” towards peace, and “no one can accuse Ukraine of not moving towards sustainable peace after this.”  
• US President Donald Trump (to reporters): “We’re thinking about all of [the sanctions] right now. We’re looking at all of them.”  
• Downing Street spokeswoman: “We are obviously hopeful of the progress,” while declining to say whether the UK will ease any sanctions on Russia.  
• Tulsi Gabbard, US Director of National Intelligence (briefing the Senate): Russia is “a major security threat,” notably for its cyber-attack capabilities and “a new satellite designed to carry a nuclear weapon.”  
• Reuters-quoted Odesa residents (less formal but named):  
  – Inna Zhelezniak: “They [Russians] never keep their words. All these deals will not be in Ukraine’s favour.”  
  – Anastasiia Drachenko: “Putin and not only Putin – everyone in his government are terrorists.”  
  – Nadiia: “We want peaceful nights very much…walk calmly with the child.”  

Analytical observations from correspondents  
• BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner: Both sides face a strong temptation to resume firing, risks include violations (e.g. Russian ships moving westwards) leading to Ukrainian self-defence strikes, or even false-flag attacks to discredit the other.  
• BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale: For the first time, the US, Russia and Ukraine have jointly committed to “ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”

Query: I’m looking for recent US government statements accusing Russia of invading any country besides Ukraine, including possible actions in Africa or the Caucasus.
Here are the relevant news articles:

**Russia Condemns Ukraine's Drone Attack on Russian-Controlled Area**
The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the Ukrainian military's drone attack on the densely populated market in the Russian-controlled town of Aleshki in Ukraine's Kherson region on May 1. According to Russian media, Ukraine launched around 30 drones in four batches, killing 7 civilians and injuring over 20. Russia also criticized Ukraine for targeting the area with a second wave of drone attacks, 'deliberately targeting survivors and emergency responders who arrived at the scene.' The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that Ukraine 'intentionally chose to attack civilians on a public holiday, which is appalling.' They also accused Ukraine of escalating the conflict and destroying the prospects for peaceful resolution, calling Ukraine's leadership 'a new batch of Bandera followers who are completely unwilling to talk.' Ukrainian spokesperson Voloshyn stated that the target of the attack was Russian-controlled areas in Kherson, and that 'all the dead were military personnel, with no civilians involved.' The Russian Foreign Ministry also condemned the West for providing weapons and funding to Ukraine, saying that 'Kiev's authorities and their Western supporters claim to restore Ukraine to its 1991 borders, which is unfounded and unrealistic.' 'Russia will take all necessary measures to ensure that this situation never happens,' they added. This comes after Ukrainian President Zelensky stated that Ukraine 'does not recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea' and that 'Crimea is internationally recognized as Ukrainian territory.' Former US President Trump criticized Zelensky's statement, saying that 'Crimea has been lost for many years' and that Zelensky's comments 'harm peace talks.' In an interview with 'Time' magazine, Trump again expressed his view that Russia's military invasion is due to Ukraine's desire to join NATO, and implied that he agrees with this assessment. Last week, Zelensky stated that Ukraine 'currently lacks sufficient weapons' to retake Crimea, but that 'the international community has various ways to pressure Russia' and can discuss the issue of territory.

**Russia Accuses Ukraine of Drone Attack on Civilians in Kherson**
Russia claims that Ukraine's drones attacked civilians in the Russian-controlled city of Kherson, Ukraine, resulting in at least 7 deaths and over 20 injuries. According to RIA Novosti, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-appointed governor of Kherson, stated on Telegram that the Ukrainian army attacked the Oleksiyivka market with drones, causing at least 7 deaths and over 20 injuries. The Russian Federal Security Service has launched an investigation into the alleged Ukrainian attack as a terrorist act. The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the Ukrainian attack, stating that 'the Ukrainian army deliberately attacked a crowded market on a holiday, aiming to cause the maximum number of civilian casualties.' The ministry also claimed that 'the Ukrainian government and its Western backers are increasingly revealing their hostile intentions to erase Russia from the map, with their groundless and unrealistic claims to restore Ukraine's 1991 borders.' Russia emphasized that 'it will take all necessary measures to prevent such scenarios from happening.' Ukraine, which is negotiating a ceasefire with Russia through US mediation, demands that Russia return the occupied territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, as well as Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. However, Russia insists that it will only recognize Ukraine's sovereignty over these territories if the Ukrainian army withdraws from them.

**Russia Accuses Ukraine of Attacking CROWDED MARKET, Ukraine Denies Allegations**
Russia accused Ukraine of attacking a crowded market in the Russian-controlled south of Ukraine with drones, resulting in at least seven civilian deaths and over 20 injuries. However, Ukraine denied the allegations, stating that only military targets were hit. Reuters could not independently verify the claims from either side. Wladimir Saldo, the Russian-appointed governor of the region, said that the drones struck a market in the city of Oleshky at around 9:30 am local time on a public holiday. Saldo and two social media users posted videos that allegedly show the incident, but Reuters could only verify the location as Oleshky and not the exact time of the footage. One video shows an explosion next to a group of low-rise buildings, while another video shows at least two bodies on the ground next to a building, but the identities of the victims cannot be confirmed. Wladyslaw Woloschyn, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military, stated that Ukraine had attacked Russian troops in the region of Kherson, which is controlled by Moscow, and that only military personnel were killed, not civilians. The Russian Foreign Ministry called on the international community to condemn the attack as a terrorist act. 'After the first attacks, which had already claimed victims, the enemy launched a second drone attack, killing the survivors as well as the rescue teams that rushed to the scene,' the ministry said in a statement. 'This is another bloody war crime.' The local Russian-appointed official, Sergei Cherwko, claimed that around 30 Ukrainian drones struck the market in four waves, but Reuters has asked Saldo for clarification. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of intentionally targeting civilians during the ongoing war, a claim that both sides deny. The number of civilian casualties is significantly higher on the Ukrainian side. Russian attacks in the past month, which Moscow claims were aimed at military targets, killed 19 people in the city of Kryvyi Rih, 35 in Sumy, and 12 in the capital Kiev. This prompted US President Donald Trump to urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to 'STOP!' Rodion Miroshnik, a special envoy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, described the attack on Oleshky as a 'monstrous atrocity' that undermines the peace rhetoric of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine claims it is seeking a minimum 30-day ceasefire to facilitate talks on a just peace, but Russia has not agreed to a ceasefire, although Putin has announced a unilateral three-day ceasefire for next week. The Kremlin says it is ready for direct talks with Kiev.

**Russia Rejects Ukraine's Pre-1991 Borders, Accuses Ukraine of 'Genocidal Instinct'**
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that Russia will not allow Ukraine to restore its pre-1991 borders, as this would be a 'genocidal instinct to destroy everything Russian.' This statement was made in response to the attack on the city of Oleshky in the temporarily occupied Kherson region. Russia accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on a local market, resulting in the deaths of 7 civilians and over 20 injuries. However, Russian Telegram channels reported that Russian military personnel, who were evacuating civilians, were killed in the attack. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for Russia to be pushed towards diplomacy, following a recent wave of Russian attacks on Ukrainian regions.

**Russia Distorts Reality, Accuses Ukraine of Attacking Peaceful Market**
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) has distorted the situation and accused Ukrainian forces of attacking a peaceful market in the occupied part of the Kherson region. According to the MID, Ukrainian forces allegedly launched a drone attack on the market, resulting in 7 deaths and 20 injuries. However, the actual situation is that Ukrainian forces used FPV-drones to target Russian military personnel hiding among civilians on the market. The Ukrainian forces used FPV-kamikaze drones to avoid harming civilians and successfully destroyed the enemy's location, killing 5 Russian soldiers who were calmly smoking cigarettes. The MID has used this incident to justify their claim that Ukraine has no right to return to its pre-1991 borders and that Russia will not return the occupied territories. As stated by the MID, 'It is completely obvious that behind the unfounded claims (of Kiev - ed.) is the so-called restoration of Ukraine in the borders of 1991. Of course, Russia will never allow the implementation of such a scenario.' However, this statement is a clear attempt to cover up their own recklessness and mislead the international community.

**Russia Vows to Never Allow Ukraine's Territorial Integrity, US Welcomes Oil Deal**
The Russian Foreign Ministry has released a statement saying that Moscow will 'never allow' the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders of 1991. The statement claims that the Ukrainian government and its Western supporters are seeking to 'destroy everything Russian' and that Russia will 'never allow' such a scenario. Meanwhile, the US has welcomed the oil deal with Ukraine as a 'historic agreement' that strengthens their position in negotiations with Russia. US Vice President JD Vance has stated that the US will 'work hard' to bring a lasting solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the next 100 days. The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths on both sides, and Vance has called for both sides to present a peace proposal. The US has also announced that it will provide military aid to Ukraine, with a value of $50 million or more. Additionally, the Ukrainian military has reported that they have shot down 74 out of 170 Russian drones in a recent attack. The Russian military has been accused of war crimes, including the systematic execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war. The US has also announced that it will provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including food and medicine. The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, and the international community is calling for a peaceful resolution.

**Sergueï Choïgou Denounces Ukrainian Methods as Terrorism, Warns Against Western Military Deployment**
Russian Security Council Secretary Sergueï Choïgou has denounced the methods used by Ukraine as terrorism. He accused Kiev of targeted attacks on civilians and sabotage on Russian strategic infrastructure. He warned that any Western military deployment in Ukraine would be considered a legitimate target by Moscow. Sergueï Choïgou stated that 'Kiev has resorted to terrorist methods by using NATO arms against residential areas, conducting sabotage and political assassinations, and using civilians as human shields.' He cited the attack on the Soudja gas measurement station and attempts on the Caspian Sea oil pipeline consortium. He also accused Ukrainian forces of looting in Russian villages and killing civilians. These actions are described by Moscow as 'state terrorism.' Sergueï Choïgou also issued a clear warning to the West regarding any military presence on Ukrainian soil. 'For Russia, the deployment of Western military forces on Ukrainian territory is totally unacceptable. These units will be considered legitimate targets for the armed forces of the Russian Federation,' he said. He mentioned plans for 'pseudo-peace missions' serving as a pretext for future European occupation of western Ukraine regions. Sergueï Choïgou also accused European countries of obstructing a Ukrainian conflict exit. 'European states are seeking to prolong the conflict and prevent normalization of relations between Moscow and Washington,' he said. He recalled that exchanges with the US administration had allowed tracing cooperation paths for a political solution, but that these efforts are constantly hindered by the aggressive attitude of the European Union. For the Russian Security Council Secretary, Europe is deliberately pushing Kiev to refuse any compromise and pursue military escalation.

**Russia Rejects Ukraine's Territorial Integrity Restoration**
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made an aggressive statement, categorically rejecting the possibility of Ukraine restoring its territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as of 1991. The statement claims that Moscow 'will never allow' such a scenario to occur. The document also contains familiar Russian propaganda accusations against the Ukrainian government and Western countries, alleging 'man-eating' intentions aimed at 'destroying everything Russian'. According to the statement, 'It is completely obvious that behind the futile and unsubstantiated demands of the Kiev regime and its supporters in the West, the 'man-eating' instinct of destroying everything Russian stands behind the so-called restoration of Ukraine in the borders of 1991. It is clear that Russia will never allow the implementation of such a scenario,' the message reads. This statement comes as the US and Ukraine have signed an agreement on the Investment Fund for Reconstruction, which US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called a step towards ending the war.

As stated by the MID, 'It is completely obvious that behind the unfounded claims (of Kiev - ed.) is the so-called restoration of Ukraine in the borders of 1991. Of course, Russia will never allow the implementation of such a scenario.' However, this statement is a clear attempt to cover up their own recklessness and mislead the international community.

**Russia Vows to Never Allow Ukraine's Territorial Integrity, US Welcomes Oil Deal**
The Russian Foreign Ministry has released a statement saying that Moscow will 'never allow' the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders of 1991. The statement claims that the Ukrainian government and its Western supporters are seeking to 'destroy everything Russian' and that Russia will 'never allow' such a scenario. Meanwhile, the US has welcomed the oil deal with Ukraine as a 'historic agreement' that strengthens their position in negotiations with Russia. US Vice President JD Vance has stated that the US will 'work hard' to bring a lasting solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the next 100 days. The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths on both sides, and Vance has called for both sides to present a peace proposal. The US has also announced that it will provide military aid to Ukraine, with a value of $50 million or more. Additionally, the Ukrainian military has reported that they have shot down 74 out of 170 Russian drones in a recent attack. The Russian military has been accused of war crimes, including the systematic execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war. The US has also announced that it will provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including food and medicine. The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, and the international community is calling for a peaceful resolution.

**Sergueï Choïgou Denounces Ukrainian Methods as Terrorism, Warns Against Western Military Deployment**
Russian Security Council Secretary Sergueï Choïgou has denounced the methods used by Ukraine as terrorism. He accused Kiev of targeted attacks on civilians and sabotage on Russian strategic infrastructure. He warned that any Western military deployment in Ukraine would be considered a legitimate target by Moscow. Sergueï Choïgou stated that 'Kiev has resorted to terrorist methods by using NATO arms against residential areas, conducting sabotage and political assassinations, and using civilians as human shields.' He cited the attack on the Soudja gas measurement station and attempts on the Caspian Sea oil pipeline consortium. He also accused Ukrainian forces of looting in Russian villages and killing civilians. These actions are described by Moscow as 'state terrorism.' Sergueï Choïgou also issued a clear warning to the West regarding any military presence on Ukrainian soil. 'For Russia, the deployment of Western military forces on Ukrainian territory is totally unacceptable. These units will be considered legitimate targets for the armed forces of the Russian Federation,' he said. He mentioned plans for 'pseudo-peace missions' serving as a pretext for future European occupation of western Ukraine regions. Sergueï Choïgou also accused European countries of obstructing a Ukrainian conflict exit. 'European states are seeking to prolong the conflict and prevent normalization of relations between Moscow and Washington,' he said. He recalled that exchanges with the US administration had allowed tracing cooperation paths for a political solution, but that these efforts are constantly hindered by the aggressive attitude of the European Union. For the Russian Security Council Secretary, Europe is deliberately pushing Kiev to refuse any compromise and pursue military escalation.

**Ukraine: SBU Arrests Weapons Factory Owners, Russia Accused of Cyberattacks, and More**
The Ukrainian Interior Ministry's SBU has arrested the head of a weapons factory in the Dnipropetrowsk region and his deputy for supplying the Ukrainian army with 120,000 defective grenades. The factory had received a contract to produce mortar shells in early 2024. 'The suspects used substandard materials and performed inadequate work,' said SBU spokesperson Artem Dekhtiarenko in a video released by the Ukrainian intelligence agency. The defendants face up to 15 years in prison. In other news, a man in Latvia has been sentenced to six years in prison for fighting for the Russian military in Ukraine. The man had joined the Russian army in 2023 and was stationed in the Donetsk region, where he participated in the construction of defensive fortifications, performed guard duty, and took part in tactical combat and shooting exercises. He also crossed the border from Russia into Latvia in the fall of 2023 and was arrested by border guards. In France, the foreign ministry has accused the Russian GRU military intelligence agency of conducting a series of cyberattacks on French authorities, ministries, defense companies, and think tanks since 2021. The ministry has filed charges against the APT28 unit, also known as 'Fancy Bear' or 'Sofacy Group,' which operates out of Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia. In Ukraine, the government has evacuated seven villages in the Dnipropetrowsk region due to the advancing Russian troops. The region's governor, Serhij Lyssak, has stated that the decision was unavoidable due to the Russian attacks on civilians. In Russia, the Kremlin has rejected Ukraine's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, citing the need for further negotiations. The Russian government has also accused Ukraine of using the ceasefire to regroup its troops and rearm. In other news, the Russian government has identified a known environmental activist, Vladimir Sliwjak, as a foreign agent. Sliwjak has been a vocal critic of Russia's war in Ukraine and has been involved in the fight against the transportation of nuclear waste. The Russian government has also accused Ukraine of conducting a drone attack on the Russian region of Belgorod, killing two people and injuring three others. The Ukrainian government has denied the allegations. In the United States, the US government has warned President Donald Trump against making a deal with Russia that would lead to further aggression against Ukraine. The US government has also accused Russia of planning to establish a buffer zone in the Ukrainian region of Sumy. In other news, a 12-year-old girl was killed in a Russian drone attack in the Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrowsk. The girl's parents were injured in the attack, and another child was rescued from the rubble. Trump has stated that he stands on the side of Ukraine, but not necessarily on the side of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The US government has also predicted that a rapprochement between the US and Russia will boost Russia's economic growth. The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies has forecast a 2.5% growth in Russia's economy in 2026, up from 1.6% in the winter. 'The existing US sanctions are already being only half-heartedly implemented,' said wiiw-Russland-Experte Vasily Astrov. Foreign companies such as Renault, Hyundai, and Samsung are considering a return to Russia.

**Kremlin Responds to Trump's Call with Nuclear Threats**
The Kremlin has responded to US President Donald Trump's call for increased European defense responsibility with nuclear threats, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu accused Europe of preparing for a military conflict with Russia over the next three to five years and increasing its military presence near Russian and Belarusian borders. Shoigu also accused European states of increasing their military presence near the western borders of the Union State of Russia and Belarus, and claimed that the EU is trying to become a 'military organization against Russia.' He complained about the growing military spending of Poland, Lithuania, and Estonia. Shoigu confirmed that Russia has deployed 'Orekh' missiles in Belarus and reminded that Russia's nuclear doctrine was changed in November 2024, allowing the Kremlin to use nuclear and conventional weapons in case of aggression against Russia or Belarus. ISW noted that Shoigu's statements are aimed at deterring NATO and that Russian officials have used similar rhetoric before the 2008 invasion of Georgia, 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied aggressive intentions, but accused Baltic states of discriminating against Russian-speaking people. ISW noted that Moscow has repeatedly used this narrative to justify its military invasions. Analysts believe that the states mentioned by Moscow as 'militarized' - Finland, Poland, and the Baltic states - are located near Russian borders and are under the greatest threat. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is trying to exert informational pressure on the West to influence the architecture of European security in its own interests. ISW believes that Shoigu's nuclear threats are part of a broader information-psychological campaign aimed at influencing Western decision-making. Such statements may be an attempt to force European states to cut their defense programs, making NATO's eastern flank more vulnerable. This strategy corresponds to the requirements of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who demanded in 2021 that NATO not deploy troops to the territories of countries that joined the Alliance after 1997. 'Threats from Peskov and Lavrov to Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania echo the rhetoric of other Kremlin officials, which is likely an element of informational preparation for possible attempts by Russia to expand its influence in Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia,' ISW said in its report. The Institute also noted the statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that 'fascists' are allegedly seizing territories that once belonged to the Russian Empire or the USSR, as well as threats from Putin's aide Nikolai Patrushev to Finland. 'This is evidence that the Kremlin continues to consider these territories as areas of its own influence, which can be used to justify further acts of aggression,' ISW concluded.

**Trump Condemns Russian Attacks on Kiev, Calls for Ceasefire**
US President Donald Trump has condemned the Russian attacks on Kiev on social media, calling them 'unnecessary' and 'unfortunate'. Trump directly addressed Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying 'Vladimir, stop! We're losing 5,000 soldiers a week. It's time to conclude the Peace Agreement!' The Ukrainian government has classified the attack as one of the most severe since the start of the war in Kiev. According to local authorities, nine people died and 63 were injured in the attack, including children. The new Russian bombing hit at least four neighborhoods in Kiev, causing fires in several residential buildings, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the military administration of the capital. Rescue operations continue amidst the rubble, with at least 42 people hospitalized, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the bombing 'one of the most absurd attacks of the war' and demanded that Russia immediately stop the massive attacks. Zelensky also accused Moscow of violating the ceasefire agreement in the Black Sea, signed with the US in March, and announced that he would shorten his official visit to South Africa to return to the country. Russia declared that it will continue its 'military operation to hit military and adjacent targets.' In response to the accusations of violating the agreement, the Russian government stated that the ceasefire mentioned by Zelensky had already expired, but that it was still in dialogue with the US to find a solution. After the nighttime bombings that hit Kiev and other Ukrainian cities, the Russian government accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of sabotaging diplomatic efforts for a peace agreement, according to Reuters. According to Moscow, Zelensky's refusal to recognize the annexation of Crimea would be one of the main obstacles to advancing the negotiations. In an interview with reporters, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated that it is increasingly clear that Zelensky 'does not have the capacity to negotiate the end of the conflict.' Zakharova also harshly criticized European countries, accusing them of encouraging the continuation of the war by continuing to provide arms to Kiev. According to her, this stance reinforces Zelensky's willingness to maintain the confrontation, regardless of human losses. Zakharova also stated that the decision to maintain military support for Ukraine reveals the fear of some European nations of a possible Russian victory in the conflict.

**Ukraine Accuses Russia of Seeking to Maintain Invasion After Kiev Attack**
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andri Sybiga stated that the recent Russian attack on Kiev, which killed nine people, proves that Moscow is committed to maintaining the invasion. Sybiga expressed the opinion of the Ukrainian government through a social media post, criticizing Russia's 'demands', referring to the Russian leadership's statements that Ukraine must 'withdraw' from territories as a condition for peace. The Ukrainian emergency services reported a provisional number of nine dead and 63 injured, including six children, in the recent Russian missile attacks. The attacks damaged residential buildings and caused several fires. According to the emergency services, 'residential buildings were damaged: searches are underway to find people under the rubble.' A journalist from Agence France Presse witnessed a dozen residents taking shelter in a basement of a residential building as soon as the air raid alert sounded. This Russian attack, one of the most violent in recent months, occurred at a time when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was accused by US President Donald Trump of sabotaging a possible agreement with Russia.

**Russia Continues Confidence-Building Measures with US, Criticizes EU's Actions in South Caucasus**
Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Maria Zaharova stated that Russia is continuing to engage in confidence-building measures with the US. She noted that the Americans are beginning to understand the information provided by Russia on the Ukraine crisis, including the need to remove the underlying causes of the crisis. Zaharova emphasized that this process requires patience and time, as well as a careful approach based on the analysis of facts. She also stated that the current US administration is committed to achieving this goal. Zaharova highlighted that Russia and the US have agreed to a 30-day ceasefire on energy-related attacks, which began on March 18, but Ukraine has not adhered to this agreement and has continued to attack Russian energy infrastructure. She warned that any future agreements with Ukraine must be implemented. Zaharova also criticized the plans of the UK and France to deploy a peacekeeping force to Ukraine, saying that this could lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO. She also stated that the EU sees the South Caucasus region as the front line of the global hybrid war. Zaharova also criticized the EU's actions in the region, saying that they are not bringing stability and peace to the region, but rather creating divisions and tensions. She also accused France of trying to undermine the relations between Russia and Armenia. Additionally, Zaharova stated that Russia will respond proportionally to any risks and threats posed by Estonia, including the use of force against foreign ships. She also accused the EU of trying to turn Moldova into a military base, and criticized the Moldovan government for trying to abolish the autonomy of the Gagauz region. Zaharova also condemned the Moldovan government's decision to abolish the Gagauz region's right to appoint its own prosecutor, and called on international organizations to take note of the situation in the region.

**Russia's Ambitions: Capturing More Ukrainian Territory and Beyond**
Russian officials, led by Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov, continue to escalate the information war, demanding that Ukraine surrender not only occupied territories but also regions under the control of Kiev. According to ISW analysts, Lavrov stated in a new interview that Russia and the US have not reached an agreement on 'key parameters' of the ceasefire agreement. He emphasized that Putin's demand for the transfer of all territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions, including those controlled by Kiev, is a requirement. Lavrov referred to these regions as 'Donbass' and 'Novorossiya', claiming that Ukraine 'does not represent' their residents. He also stated that Ukraine 'does not represent' Odessa, which he believes was 'built by Russia'. Lavrov's statements indicate that Russia plans to capture even more Ukrainian territory, contradicting the ongoing negotiations with the US aimed at stopping the war. Furthermore, Lavrov expressed a desire to capture territories in Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia, including NATO member countries. He claimed that it is 'dangerous' when 'fascists seize lands that never belonged to anyone except the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union'. ISW notes that these statements demonstrate Russia's continued consideration of independent countries that were once part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union as part of its modern territory, including Moldova, the Baltic states, and parts of Poland and Finland, which have already joined NATO.

According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Lavrov stated in a recent interview that Russia and the US have not reached an agreement on the 'key parameters' of a ceasefire agreement.

Lavrov referred to these regions as 'Donbas' and 'Novorossiya', claiming that Ukraine 'does not represent' their residents. He also stated that Ukraine 'does not represent' Odessa, which he believes was 'built by Russia'. Earlier, Putin claimed that 'Novorossiya' is an integral part of Russia. Meanwhile, Peskov included Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, and Odessa regions in 'Novorossiya'. In 2023, Putin referred to Odessa, Crimea, and the entire Black Sea region as unrelated to Ukraine. ISW analysts note that Lavrov's new statements indicate that Russia is planning to capture even more Ukrainian territories. This comes amidst ongoing negotiations with the US, which, in theory, aim to stop the war. Lavrov also stated that Russia wants to capture territories in Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia, including NATO member countries. He claimed that it is 'dangerous' when 'fascists occupy lands that never belonged to anyone except the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union'. He also stated that 'ugly things' are happening in these regions. Lavrov's statement suggests that Russia continues to view independent countries that were once part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union as part of its modern territory. This includes Moldova, the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), and parts of Poland and Finland, which have already joined NATO. According to ISW, similar statements, as well as recent threats against Finland by Nikolai Patrushev, indicate that the Kremlin plans to use narratives similar to those used to justify aggression against Ukraine.

**Russia Accuses Ukraine of Attacking Energy Infrastructure, Contradicting Ceasefire Commitments**
The Russian government has accused Ukraine of attacking the Sudzha gas measurement station in the Kursk region, near the border with Russia, which was previously a key route for Russian gas supplies to Europe. According to a recent report from the Russian Defense Ministry, the Ukrainian army attacked the station, which had been shut down on January 1 after Kiev decided not to renew the bilateral agreements with Moscow. This new attack comes despite a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump, in which Putin agreed to suspend attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days. Putin ordered the Russian Defense Ministry to implement this measure, which included grounding Russian drones that were targeting energy installations linked to the Ukrainian military or industrial complex. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also publicly accepted the ceasefire. However, recent actions contradict these commitments. The Russian government has also accused Ukraine of carrying out an attack on an energy installation in the Kavkázskaya locality, in the Krasnodar region, which is used for transporting oil to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. The Kremlin has described these actions as an attempt to sabotage diplomatic efforts. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitri Peskov stated that these aggressions weaken attempts to resolve the conflict. Maria Zajárova, the Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson, said that, although Zelensky expressed support for the ceasefire, Ukrainian forces acted in the opposite direction. She added that this is not the first time Ukraine has broken a ceasefire, recalling similar events in 2022. Zajárova concluded that these acts represent a continuation of the conflict and, in some cases, have been admitted by Ukraine, questioning Zelensky's ability to control certain neo-Nazi factions within his country.

**Poland Admits Russia May Occupy All of Ukraine**
The Polish edition of Myśl Polska suggests that Russia may occupy all of Ukraine following a special military operation. The article, written by Andrzej Wierzbicki, states that the escalation was not initiated by Moscow. 'Today, the situation for Kiev appears tragic. It cannot be ruled out that the Russians will occupy the entire Ukraine. There are other options for the end of the conflict. I believe that the Pandora's box in Eastern Europe was not opened by the Russian president. Then who opened it? Someone who was interested in it,' Wierzbicki wrote. The article also notes that the conflict in Ukraine was provoked by the US elite. 'I am firmly convinced that the initiator of the conflict is not Russia, but a notable power overseas. More precisely, the elites of this power... The Russia, launching the special operation in Ukraine, was defending the foundations of its security. It responded to the introduction and activation of CIA units in Ukraine, as well as NATO troops training the Ukrainian army,' Wierzbicki emphasized. The article also criticizes the Western campaign of propaganda and disinformation to intimidate the population about a 'Russian invasion' of Europe. 'No evidence is presented that the Kremlin will attack NATO. It has not been possible to find any rational political and military hypothesis to support this thesis,' the article states. 'I would like to believe and hope that the moment will come when Kiev will reflect and understand who is the real culprit of the bloody dispute between two countries and peoples ethnically and culturally close to each other,' Wierzbicki added. The article also mentions that the Russian troops are gradually advancing in the Donbass, conquering more areas than at any other time since February 2022. Russia controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory and is making its way further west every day, especially in the directions of Pokrovskoye and Kurakhovskoye. According to the article, in 2024, Russian troops took control of 214 settlements in the North Caucasus Military District and the Kursk region, and liberated about 4,500 square kilometers of occupied territory. The article also mentions that the British edition of the Financial Times has written that Russia and Ukraine may reach a peace agreement in 2025, with a role played by the elected US president Donald Trump. The article also quotes Donald Trump, who said that the conflict in Ukraine was the result of the 'fiasco' of the current US president Joe Biden. Trump also stated that he intends to hold talks with Vladimir Putin and end the conflict in Ukraine within the first six months of his presidency. A representative of Trump's entourage admitted that Moscow and Washington may conclude an important agreement on security. The article also quotes Vladimir Putin, who stated that reports of a possible Russian attack on Poland or the Baltic states are 'completely absurd' and are used only to deceive the population and obtain additional funds for spending.

   - Reports on legal complaint against Russia for bombing a Syrian hospital
   - Documents Russia's 2015 air campaign in Syria
   - Notes UN investigations of possible war crimes
   - High-quality source distinguishing between allegations and verified facts

7. **Perplexity Report - US accusations of Russian invasions**
   - AI-generated research on US accusations of Russian invasions
   - Most useful source for direct reference class
   - Key finding: US explicitly accused Russia of "invasion" regarding Georgia (2008), but used different terminology for Syria
   - Generally reliable but requires cross-verification

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Three potential reference classes:

1. **Historical US accusations of Russian invasions** - The US has explicitly used "invasion" terminology only for Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014/2022). For Syria and other interventions, the US has used terms like "military intervention," "aggression," or focused on war crimes allegations. This is the most directly relevant reference class.

2. **Russian military interventions in sovereign countries** - Russia has militarily intervened in Georgia (2008), Syria (2015-present), and Ukraine (2014/2022). This is informative but doesn't necessarily predict US rhetorical responses.

3. **Ongoing conflicts with Russian involvement** - Currently, Russia is actively engaged militarily in Ukraine and Syria, with troops in Moldova's Transnistria region. This helps identify potential flashpoints but doesn't directly indicate likelihood of US accusations.

The first reference class is most suitable as it directly addresses the specific prediction target: US government accusations using "invasion" terminology.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025 - just two months. This short timeframe is crucial to the prediction:

- Historical Russian invasions (Georgia 2008, Ukraine 2014/2022) were planned over longer periods
- Russia's military is currently heavily committed in Ukraine
- For a "Yes" resolution, we'd need both a new Russian invasion AND a formal US accusation within this narrow window
- The US typically employs diplomatic and intelligence channels before making formal public accusations

## (d) Justification

Considering the reference class of historical US accusations, several factors suggest a low probability:

1. **Historical precedent**: The US has explicitly accused Russia of invasion only in Georgia (2008) and Ukraine, despite Russia's military interventions elsewhere. The threshold for using "invasion" terminology appears high, requiring clear territorial violation with ground forces.

2. **Russia's current military capacity**: Russia's military is heavily engaged in Ukraine, stretching its resources for launching another major invasion. This significantly reduces the likelihood of a new full-scale invasion within the short timeframe.

3. **Potential flashpoints**: 
   - Syria: Russia already has a military presence with Assad's consent, making new accusations of "invasion" unlikely
   - Moldova/Transnistria: Russian troops have been present for years without US "invasion" accusations
   - Other potential theaters would require significant escalation

4. **Short timeframe**: The two-month window provides limited opportunity for (a) Russia to plan and execute a new invasion and (b) the US to gather intelligence and formally make public accusations.

5. **US diplomatic patterns**: The US has shown restraint in using "invasion" terminology, preferring terms like "aggression" or "intervention" for actions short of full territorial invasion with ground forces.

# Outside view calibration:

The most directly relevant data point is that the US has accused Russia of invasion only twice in recent history (Georgia 2008, Ukraine 2014/2022) despite numerous Russian military interventions. This suggests a low base rate.

Given:
- Russia's current military commitment to Ukraine limits capacity for new invasions
- The short two-month prediction window
- The high threshold the US appears to have for using "invasion" terminology
- No current indications of imminent Russian plans to invade another country

A reasonable base rate would start very low, perhaps 1-2%. However, I must consider:
- Ongoing tensions in regions like Moldova/Transnistria, Georgia, and Syria
- Potential for sudden escalation if Russia feels threatened
- The fact that Syria is experiencing rebel advances that might trigger increased Russian involvement

Considering these factors but giving primary weight to the historical reference class and short timeframe, I calibrate my prediction toward the lower end of the probability range.

# Outside View Prediction:
3%

- Reports on Assad's support for Russia's Ukraine invasion
- Respected international news source with direct quotes
- Key facts: Assad publicly praised Russia's Ukraine actions; 63,000 Russian personnel deployed to Syria; Syrian war killed nearly 500,000 people

**BBC (UN Complaint Against Russia, 2024)**
- Reports on UN Human Rights Committee complaint against Russia for bombing a Syrian hospital
- High-quality news source with detailed factual reporting
- Key facts: Complaint alleges Russian jets bombed hospital in Idlib; Russia denies targeting medical facilities
- Expert opinion: Open Society Justice Initiative characterizing this as "first time Russia is held to account... over violations in Syria"

**Perplexity Report**
- Comprehensive analysis of US accusations against Russia for invasions
- AI-generated report with citations, generally reliable but requires verification
- Key facts: US explicitly accused Russia of invasion in Georgia (2008); US criticized Russia's actions in Syria but generally avoided term "invasion"; Russia maintains troops in Moldova's Transnistria region

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

**Reference Class 1: Past Russian Military Invasions (excluding Ukraine)**
- Georgia (2008): Clear invasion with US accusations
- Syria (2015-present): Military intervention at Assad's invitation (not technically an invasion of the internationally recognized government)
- Moldova (Transnistria): Russian military presence since 1992

**Reference Class 2: Current Russian Military Deployments Outside Russia**
- Syria: Supporting Assad regime
- Georgia (South Ossetia, Abkhazia): Occupying ~20% of territory
- Moldova (Transnistria): Military presence since 1992
- Various African nations: Military advisors/Wagner Group

**Reference Class 3: Countries Currently at Risk of Russian Military Action**
- Georgia: Already partially occupied
- Moldova: Russian troops in Transnistria, pro-Western government
- Syria: Fragile situation with recent rebel advances

Reference Class 1 is most suitable as it directly addresses past patterns of Russian invasions and US responses, which is the focus of our forecasting question.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction timeframe is 61 days (May 1 to July 1, 2025).

Historical patterns:
- The Russia-Georgia war in 2008 lasted only 5 days, though preparations occurred beforehand
- Russia's intervention in Syria began suddenly in September 2015
- US accusations typically follow quickly after clear military actions by Russia

Given this short timeframe, we would need to see either:
1. An escalation of existing Russian military presence (Syria, Georgia, Moldova)
2. A rapid new deployment with minimal preparation (challenging given Russia's Ukraine commitments)

## (d) Justification:

Based on the above analysis, several factors inform my outside view prediction:

1. **Historical precedent**: The US has explicitly accused Russia of "invasion" only in Georgia (2008). For Syria, despite significant Russian military operations since 2015, the US has avoided using "invasion" terminology because Russia was invited by the Assad regime.

2. **Current Russian military capabilities**: Russia's forces are heavily committed in Ukraine, making a large-scale new invasion elsewhere logistically challenging within a 61-day window.

3. **Potential flashpoints**:
   - **Syria**: Recent rebel advances might prompt increased Russian military action, but as Russia is there at Assad's invitation, this would not qualify as an "invasion."
   - **Georgia**: Russia already occupies ~20% of Georgia. An expansion could qualify, but there are no recent indications of such preparations.
   - **Moldova**: Russian troops in Transnistria could potentially move into Moldova proper, but again, no preparations have been reported.

4. **US diplomatic considerations**: The US might be cautious about formally accusing Russia of a new invasion while the Ukraine conflict continues, to avoid further escalation.

The most plausible scenario would be an escalation of existing Russian military presence rather than an entirely new invasion, with Georgia and Moldova being the most likely locations.

## Outside view calibration:

When calibrating my prediction, I consider:

1. The US has only explicitly accused Russia of invasion in Georgia (2008). Other military interventions by Russia have been characterized differently by US officials.

2. Russia's military is heavily committed in Ukraine, making a new large-scale invasion elsewhere logistically challenging.

3. For a "Yes" resolution, we need three conditions within 61 days:
   - Russia must send ground forces into a country without consent
   - The US must specifically accuse Russia of "invasion"
   - This must occur before July 1, 2025

4. There are relatively few countries where Russia might realistically invade in this timeframe:
   - Georgia (expansion of current occupation): Possible but no recent indications
   - Moldova (from Transnistria): Possible but no recent indications
   - Syria (expanded operations): Would not count as "invasion" under our criteria as Russia is there with Assad's consent

William Freer's expert assessment that Russia's ability to divert resources from Ukraine is "extremely limited" reinforces the low probability of a new major military action.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- CNN/Guardian/CSIS on Georgia (2008): High‐quality, contemporaneous reporting of Russia’s overt invasion of Georgian territory and clear U.S. government accusations using the word “invasion.” Factual content dominates; expert commentary (e.g. Bush administration statements, OSCE data) is identifiable and credible.  
- Newsweek/Al Jazeera/BBC on Syria (2019–2024): Reliable outlets documenting Russia’s air campaign and hybrid operations in Syria, including allegations of war crimes. The U.S. consistently condemned Russia’s military actions in Syria but stopped short of labeling them a “ground invasion” of Syrian sovereign territory. Reporting includes named expert sources and official statements, but none qualify as U.S. accusations of a “ground invasion.”  
- Perplexity_report on U.S. accusations: A mixed‐source summary claiming only the 2008 Georgia conflict was formally denounced as an “invasion,” plus broad U.S. criticism of Russia’s interventions elsewhere. Its listing of Syria as an “invasion” is a mischaracterization of the language used by U.S. officials. Weight credible the single clear case (Georgia 2008), but discount Syria’s label.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
  a. Instances since 1991 of U.S. government accusing Russia of invading a sovereign state (excluding Ukraine).  
  b. Instances since 2000 of U.S. formal diplomatic statements condemning Russia’s ground military incursions.  
  c. Instances since 2015 of U.S. public statements using the word “invasion” regarding Russia outside Ukraine.  

 Suitability: Class (a) is broadest and most directly maps to the question: there is one clear event (Georgia 2008) in roughly 34 years (1991–2025), yielding a base rate of ~1/34 ≈ 3% over the full period per year of exposure.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining: 61 days (May 1 to July 1, 2025) ≈ 0.17 of a year. Historical pattern: Russia’s ground incursions into new countries are rare (Georgia in 2008 being unique). There is no current military buildup on a likely new front. The monthly hazard rate, extrapolated from the 1-in-34-year frequency, is 1/34 ≈ 0.029/year, or ~0.0024/month. Over two months this compounds to ≈0.005 (0.5%).  

4. Additional considerations  
- Status quo: Russia is focused on Ukraine; unlikely to open a new front without significant strategic shift.  
- Expert/market expectations: No major analysts forecast a new Russian ground invasion before mid-2025.  
- Risk factors for “Yes”: Sudden flare-ups in Transnistria/Moldova or Central Asia; unlikely under current Russian strategic priorities.  

Justification:  
Given one unambiguous U.S. accusation in 34 years (Georgia 2008) and none since—despite Russia’s extensive military operations in Syria—plus only two months remaining and no credible signals of a new Russian ground incursion, the outside view suggests a very low probability (~1%–2%).  

Outside view calibration:  
- Base-rate from 1991–2025: ~3% per year of “any new ground invasion” → 0.5%–1% over two months.  
- Allow small upward adjustment (e.g. for unexpected political shocks) → round to ~2%.  

Outside View Prediction: 2%

Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
1. CNN (2008 Georgia): High-quality mainstream outlet. Factual on troop movements and U.S. diplomatic language (“invasion,” “aggression”). Separates direct quotes (Bush, Cheney) from analysis.  
2. The Guardian (2008 Georgia): Reliable; documents U.S. officials (Condoleezza Rice) calling Russian actions “aggression” and “primary war aim” of regime change. Factual reporting of statements.  
3. CSIS paper (post-2008 Georgia): Think-tank analysis of Russia’s shift to hybrid tactics in Georgia. Factual on troop deployments, “borderization,” and legal context. Opinion confined to strategic assessment by experts, clearly attributed.  
4. Newsweek (Dec. 2024 Syria): Mid-tier outlet summarizing Iranian accusations against U.S./Ukraine. Mostly political opinion; limited relevance. No U.S. “invasion” accusations against Russia here.  
5. Al Jazeera (2022 Syria): Factual reporting of Assad’s praise for Russia; no U.S. response quoted. Not relevant to U.S. “invasion” language.  
6. BBC (2019 Syria hospital bombing): Credible; reports on alleged war-crime complaint. Documents Russian air actions but no U.S. “invasion” comment.  
7. Perplexity report: Aggregates instances where the U.S. has “accused” Russia of invasion or aggression. Factual on Georgia 2008; notes U.S. avoided term “invasion” in Syria, using “war crimes” and “aggression” instead. Quality is uneven—some dates/sources need verification—but overall the pattern is credible.

b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. High-profile Russian cross-border military interventions since 1990 (Georgia 2008; Ukraine 2014/2022). Only Georgia invoked “invasion” rhetoric by U.S.  
2. U.S. formal “invasion” accusations against any state actor per decade (post-Cold War). Georgia is one clear case; others (Syria) avoided the specific term.  
Suitability: Class (1) best matches the question—cross-border use of ground forces without host-government consent.

Historical rate in class (1): 1 major event in ~17 years (2008–2025). Excluding Ukraine yields one in 17.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: May 1 → July 1 2025 (61 days ≈ 0.17 years).  
Historical analog: Georgia war timing—U.S. accusations came within days of troop movements. But Russia has no imminent known plan for a second invasion. The annualized base‐rate ≈ (1 event/17 years) ≈ 6% per year. For a 0.17-year window: 6%*0.17 ≈ 1%.

d) Justification  
• Past U.S. usage of “invasion” is rare—confined to Georgia 2008 (and of course Ukraine). In Syria and other theaters, U.S. rhetoric stopped at “aggression” or “war crimes.”  
• No credible public indicators of a new Russian ground invasion of a non-Ukraine state in the next two months. Russia is heavily engaged in Ukraine and trying to maintain its current foreign deployments rather than open a new front.  
• Political incentives: The U.S. reserves “invasion” for stark territorial breaches. Border incidents or hybrid tactics (e.g., Transnistria) elicit “occupation” or “aggression,” not “invasion.”  
• Even if Russia were to cross a line (e.g., limited incursion into Moldova), U.S. language might echo “aggression” rather than invoke full “invasion.”

Outside view calibration:  
Starting from a 6% annual rate and scaling for a 0.17-year window gives ~1%. Given some political volatility but no strong signals, a slight upward adjustment to account for uncertainty puts the figure at around 3%.

Outside View Prediction:  
3% (±1%) chance that before July 1, 2025, the U.S. will publicly accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• CNN (Aug 2008) – Hard-news reporting with contemporaneous quotes from U.S. President Bush and Vice-President Cheney. High factual value; opinions come from clearly identified officials.  
• Guardian (Sep 2008) – Reputable newspaper; mixes factual recap of the war with quoted opinions by Condoleezza Rice. Factual core is solid, opinions confined to named actors.  
• CSIS paper (2021) – Well-regarded think-tank study. Provides researched facts on Russia–Georgia since 2008; commentary is analytic but comes from subject-matter experts.  
• Newsweek (Dec 2024) – Standard magazine report on Syria/Iran; only tangentially relevant. Facts rely on official Iranian statement and outside analysts; moderate quality.  
• Al Jazeera (Feb 2022) – Straight report of Assad–Putin phone call; facts are quotes from SANA. Credible for what was said, though SANA itself is a regime outlet.  
• BBC (May 2024) – High-quality outlet; article about a UN complaint concerning a 2019 Russian strike. Factual information on legal mechanism; opinions from advocacy groups.  
• Perplexity report – Secondary synthesis; its list of U.S. accusations appears accurate but mixes “invasion” with looser terms. Only one undisputed case (Georgia 2008) besides Ukraine clearly meets the question’s definition. Treat as background, not primary evidence.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “Years since 1991 in which the U.S. publicly accused Russia of invading any country (incl. Ukraine).” = 3 years (2008, 2014, 2022) out of 34 → 8.8 %/yr.  
2. “Years since 1991 in which the U.S. accused Russia of invading a country other than Ukraine.” = 1 year (2008) out of 34 → 2.9 %/yr.  
3. “Two-month periods since 1991 with such an accusation.” 1 event in 34 × 6 = 204 two-month windows → 0.49 % per window.  

Because the question explicitly excludes Ukraine, reference class 2 (and its time-scaled version 3) maps most directly onto the event definition. It is also narrow enough to avoid overcounting but broad enough (34-year window) to give a usable base rate. I therefore take class 2/3 as primary.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining: 1 May 2025 → 1 Jul 2025 = 61 days ≈ 0.167 yr.  
Base-rate conversion: 2.9 % per year → 0.29 × 0.167 ≈ 0.48 % for the remaining period (matches class 3 calculation).  
Historical pattern: All prior qualifying accusations came suddenly after visible armor crossings (Georgia), not as slow political drifts; when they happened, the U.S. responded within hours or days. That implies a near-memoryless hazard rate; if it has not happened by now, the residual two-month risk ≈ linear scaling of annual rate is reasonable.

(d) Justification  
• Russia has launched only one recognized ground invasion of a third country (Georgia) since 1991, and it occurred 17 years ago.  
• The U.S. has shown linguistic restraint: Syria (2015–) is called an “intervention,” “war crimes,” or “occupation” but not “invasion,” so similar operations are unlikely to trigger the exact wording required by the question.  
• With only 61 days left, Russian force generation is absorbed by Ukraine; logistical and political costs of opening a completely new ground campaign are extremely high.  
• No credible expert or market signals point to imminent Russian troop movements into Moldova, Georgia, or elsewhere during the next two months.  
• Thus, the outside (base-rate) view is dominated by the very small historical frequency rather than by any contemporaneous warning signs.

Outside view calibration:

Start with reference-class base rate for the 61-day window = 0.5 % (rounded).  
No strong upward or downward adjustments are justified in an outside-view-only exercise (inside-view signals are reserved for the next forecasting step).  
Account for moderate parameter uncertainty (Poisson assumption on one event in 34 yrs). A 95 % Bayesian credible interval (Jeffreys prior) puts λ between ~0.02 and ~0.17 events / yr, corresponding to 0.03–2.8 % per two-month window. The mean (0.48 %) is a natural point estimate; I nudge it slightly upward to 0.7 % to reflect fat-tail risk that the true annual hazard is closer to 5 % than to 3 %.  

Outside View Prediction:  
0.7 % (≈ 1-in-140 chance) that, before 1 July 2025, the United States will accuse Russia of invading a country other than Ukraine.

## Source Analysis

I'll analyze the provided sources for their quality, relevance, and reliability regarding US accusations of Russian invasions:

**Background Sources:**
1. **RUSI article on US-Georgia-Russia (2008)**: High-quality analysis documenting President Bush condemning Russia for "invading a sovereign neighboring state" during the Georgia conflict. Clear attribution of statements to officials.

2. **CSIS analysis on Russia's hybrid aggression against Georgia**: Detailed assessment from a reputable think tank describing Russia's 2008 invasion and subsequent occupation of ~20% of Georgian territory. Well-sourced with specific examples of Russian military activities.

3. **POLITICO article on US considering military options (2010)**: Reliable reporting with named sources revealing the Bush administration internally discussed but rejected military responses to Russia's 2008 Georgia invasion.

4. **WSJ & Washington Post articles on Russian influence operations**: High-quality reporting on US government accusations about Russian information operations. Less directly relevant to predicting new ground invasions.

5. **BBC article on Black Sea ceasefire**: Recent, reliable reporting on limited US-brokered ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, showing ongoing diplomatic engagement.

**Recent News Articles (May 2025):**
Most recent news focuses on Russia-Ukraine conflict developments rather than potential new invasions. Key themes include:
- Russian statements rejecting Ukraine's pre-1991 borders
- Trump administration's criticism of Russian attacks on Kyiv
- Russian threats against NATO deployment in Ukraine
- Russian statements suggesting territorial ambitions beyond Ukraine

The most credible information comes from direct quotes from US and Russian officials rather than analysis or commentary. No reports suggest imminent Russian plans to invade a new country.

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Historical pattern of US "invasion" accusations**: The US has only formally accused Russia of "invasion" regarding Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014/2022), despite other Russian military interventions. This establishes a high threshold for using "invasion" terminology.

2. **Russia's military capacity constraints**: Multiple sources indicate Russia remains heavily committed in Ukraine, significantly limiting its ability to launch another major invasion elsewhere within the short timeframe.

3. **Ongoing US-Russia diplomatic engagement**: Recent reporting confirms the US and Russia are engaged in ceasefire negotiations regarding Ukraine, suggesting partial diplomatic channels remain open.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Russian rhetoric about territorial ambitions**: Recent statements from Russian officials (particularly Lavrov in April 2025) suggest Russia views former Soviet territories as legitimately Russian, providing ideological foundations for potential future aggression.

2. **Trump's direct criticism of Putin**: Recent reporting shows Trump publicly calling on Putin to stop attacks in Ukraine, indicating willingness to criticize Russia publicly.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Vague Russian threats toward neighboring countries**: Russian officials have made threatening statements toward various neighbors, but these appear to be routine rhetorical positions rather than specific invasion plans.

2. **Opinion pieces predicting Russian territorial expansion**: Several sources contain speculation about Russian ambitions, but lack concrete evidence of imminent invasion plans.

## Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025 – just 2 months. This short timeframe significantly constrains probability:

1. **Historical invasion planning cycles**: Russia's past invasions (Georgia 2008, Ukraine 2014/2022) involved months of planning and preparation. The 2-month window provides limited time for planning and executing a new invasion.

2. **US accusation process**: For the US to formally accuse Russia would require:
   - Intelligence gathering on Russian activities
   - Actual invasion operations beginning
   - Internal government consultations
   - Formal public statements using specific "invasion" terminology

If the timeframe were halved to 1 month, probability would decrease substantially (perhaps by 50%) due to even less time for both invasion and accusation to materialize.

If doubled to 4 months, probability would increase moderately (perhaps by 30-50%) as it would provide more time for tensions to escalate in potential hotspots.

## Justification

Several compelling factors suggest a low probability:

1. **High threshold for US "invasion" accusations**: Historically, the US has formally accused Russia of "invasion" only in cases of clear territorial violation with ground forces. This suggests a high threshold unlikely to be met within 2 months.

2. **Russia's military capacity constraints**: Russia's military remains heavily engaged in Ukraine, constraining its ability to launch another major invasion elsewhere.

3. **Current diplomatic engagement**: The US and Russia appear engaged in discussions regarding Ukraine ceasefires, not suggesting an imminent breakdown preceding a new invasion elsewhere.

4. **Limited plausible invasion targets**: Most potential targets either:
   - Already have Russian troops present (not triggering new "invasion" accusations)
   - Are NATO members (extremely high risk for Russia)
   - Would require significant logistical preparation visible well in advance

5. **Short timeframe**: The 2-month window provides limited opportunity for Russia to plan and execute a new invasion AND for the US to gather intelligence and make formal public accusations.

The most plausible scenarios for a "Yes" resolution would involve:
- A sudden Russian expansion in Georgia beyond current occupation zones
- A manufactured crisis in Moldova/Transnistria leading to expanded Russian presence
- An unexpected intervention in a Central Asian state following internal instability

However, all these scenarios face significant constraints from Russia's current military commitments and would require rapid US decision to formally label such actions as an "invasion."

# Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 3%, I'll make adjustments based on the analyzed evidence:

**Factors decreasing probability:**
- Russia's military is heavily committed in Ukraine (-0.5%)
- The 2-month timeframe is very short for both invasion and accusation (-0.5%)
- Current US-Russia diplomatic engagement (-0.5%)

**Factors increasing probability:**
- Russian rhetoric suggesting territorial ambitions (+0.5%)
- Potential flashpoints in post-Soviet space (+0.5%)

The net adjustment is -0.5%, bringing my final estimate to 2.5%. This represents:
- Recognition of the low historical frequency of Russian invasions and US "invasion" accusations
- Acknowledgment of current constraints on Russian military capacity
- The short timeframe for events to unfold
- The potential for unexpected escalation in various flashpoints

# Checklist:
1. Before July 1, 2025, will the US accuse Russia of invading any country besides Ukraine by sending ground forces without government consent?
2. Base rate: ~3% based on historical frequency of Russian invasions and US accusations
3. 2-3 out of 100 times, the US would publicly accuse Russia of a new invasion within this 2-month period
4. Key evidence: Historical rarity of US "invasion" accusations; Russia's military commitment in Ukraine; Short 2-month window; Limited plausible invasion targets
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Russian intervention in Moldova/Transnistria triggered by manufactured crisis
6. Status quo of no new invasions likely to persist given constraints and timeframe

Probability: 2.5%
Predicted Probability: 2.5%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Documents:**
- **RUSI article (August 2008 conflict)**: High-quality analysis of US-Russia-Georgia conflict where President Bush explicitly accused Russia of invading "a sovereign neighboring state." Reliable factual account with clear official statements from Bush, Rice, McCain, and Obama.
- **CSIS paper on Russia's Hybrid Aggression**: 2021 academic analysis documenting Russia's 2008 ground invasion of Georgia and subsequent "borderization" tactics. Factual historical accounting with institutional analysis.
- **POLITICO (2010)**: Investigative reporting revealing internal US deliberations during 2008 Georgia crisis. Contains named-source statements from Hadley and other officials confirming consideration but rejection of military options.
- **WSJ article on Russian influence**: 2024 reporting on US accusations of Russian propaganda/influence operations, not related to military invasions.
- **Washington Post article (Sept 2024)**: Details US accusations about RT becoming an intelligence arm, not about military invasions.
- **BBC on Black Sea ceasefire (2025)**: Recent reporting on Russia-Ukraine negotiations with US involvement, focused on current conflict.

**AskNews Articles (April-May 2025):**
- Multiple May 1, 2025 articles about Russian accusations against Ukraine for drone attacks in Kherson.
- Several late April 2025 sources reporting Russian rejection of Ukraine's pre-1991 borders.
- April 2025 reports of Russian threats toward NATO members, including nuclear rhetoric from Sergei Shoigu.
- Coverage of Trump-Putin communications regarding Ukraine ceasefire.

None of the AskNews articles include US accusations of Russia invading any country beyond Ukraine in 2025.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Historical precedent exists - US explicitly accused Russia of invading Georgia in 2008 (Bush: "invading a sovereign neighboring state").
- No current US intelligence reports or official statements identifying Russian military buildups near borders of countries other than Ukraine.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Current US-Russia diplomatic engagement shows Trump administration pursuing negotiated resolution in Ukraine rather than escalatory rhetoric.
- Russian threatening statements toward NATO countries and South Caucasus (via Lavrov, Shoigu) signal continued tensions but not imminent action.
- Russian rejection of Ukraine's territorial integrity demonstrates aggressive stance on former Soviet territories.

**Weak evidence:**
- Seasonal factors (spring/summer historically favorable for military operations).
- Russian accusations of "Western occupation" plans in western Ukraine regions.
- Historical Russian opportunism during periods of Western distraction.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Prediction timeframe: 61 days (May 1 to July 1, 2025)

If halved (30 days): Probability would decrease further to ~1% as Russia would have even less time to plan, execute, and provoke US accusations regarding a new invasion.

If doubled (120 days): Probability would increase to perhaps 3-4%, allowing more time for current tensions to potentially escalate, especially in regions like Georgia, Moldova/Transnistria, or Baltic states.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 2%, current factors warrant minimal adjustment:

**Factors decreasing probability:**
- No evidence of Russian military preparations near non-Ukrainian borders (strong)
- Trump administration pursuing diplomatic approach with Russia (moderate)
- Russia strategically focused on securing gains in Ukraine rather than opening new fronts (moderate)
- Very short timeframe (61 days) limits Russia's ability to plan and execute new operations (moderate)

**Factors increasing probability:**
- Russian officials making threatening statements about NATO members and former Soviet territories (moderate)
- Ongoing Russian presence in Georgia creates potential for escalation (weak)
- Russian claims about "NATO encirclement" could be used to justify action (weak)

The most significant factor is the absence of any detected preparations for a new invasion, which substantially reduces the likelihood of a "Yes" outcome. Even if Russia took some limited military action, Trump's diplomatic approach makes it less likely the US would specifically use the term "invasion" compared to previous administrations.

## Probability calibration

The outside view gave us 2% probability. The strongest current evidence suggests this may even be slightly high given:
1. Absence of Russian military buildups near non-Ukrainian borders
2. Trump administration's focus on diplomatic resolution with Russia
3. Extremely short timeframe (61 days)
4. Russia's strategic focus on Ukraine

However, I should not underestimate the possibility of unexpected events or rapid escalations, particularly given Russian rhetoric about NATO countries and historical tensions in regions like Georgia.

The balance of evidence suggests the 2% outside view remains reasonable. While one could argue for a slight downward adjustment to 1-1.5%, the historical precedent (Georgia 2008) and ongoing tensions in multiple regions maintain the possibility that unexpected events could trigger a US accusation.

## Checklist:
1. Before July 1, 2025, will the US formally accuse Russia of sending ground troops to invade a non-Ukrainian country without that government's consent?
2. Outside view: ~2% over 2-month period based on historical frequency of US accusations of Russian invasions.
3. In 2 of 100 similar two-month periods, the US would accuse Russia of invading a new country.
4. Key evidence: No detected Russian military buildup near new borders; Trump pursuing diplomacy with Putin; Russia focused on Ukraine; But Russian threatening rhetoric persists.
5. Blind spot: Sudden limited Russian incursion into Georgian territory near South Ossetia could prompt unexpected US response.
6. Status quo favors continued focus on Ukraine without new fronts.

Probability: 2%
Predicted Probability: 2.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• RUSI article on US–Georgia–Russia (2008) – high-quality think-tank piece summarizing US condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Georgia. Facts and direct quotes from Bush, Rice, McCain, Obama. Strong evidence of how the US labels Russian ground incursions without consent. (September 2024)  
• CSIS report on Russia’s hybrid strategy in Georgia – respected policy paper documenting Russia’s continued military control since 2008, but no fresh ground invasions. Useful for assessing Moscow’s likely next moves. (August 2021)  
• Politico “US pondered military use in Georgia” – credible news report detailing US internal debates in 2008. Confirms US reluctance to use force against Russia despite clear invasion. (Feb 2010)  
• WSJ on Russia’s election influence (May 2025) – reliable reporting on DOJ accusations of covert propaganda and influence operations, but pertains to information warfare, not military invasion. Shows US readiness to publicly accuse Russia of non-kinetic aggression.  
• Washington Post on RT sanctions (Sept 2024) – authoritative coverage of US designating RT as an intelligence arm. Reflects US willingness to use strong language (“covert arm of intelligence”) but still stops short of calling media operations an “invasion.”  
• BBC on Black Sea ceasefire (May 2025) – top-tier journalism on US-brokered Black Sea deal. Russia’s activities in the Black Sea are maritime and do not represent a new ground invasion.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts)  
- No recent credible reports or intelligence indicators of Russian ground-force deployments into any country besides Ukraine.  
- Russia’s ground forces remain heavily committed in Ukraine, constraining capacity for a new front.  
- Historically, US has only formally accused Russia of invading Georgia in 2008; other interventions (Syria) have been characterized differently due to consent from local authorities.  

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)  
- US political environment: the Biden/Trump debate and midterm elections make Washington wary of any steps that might escalate with Russia.  
- US readiness to publicly condemn non-military Russian aggression (e.g., election meddling, RT sanctions) but not to escalate to formal “invasion” language without clear ground operations.  

Weak evidence (small shifts)  
- Ongoing Russia-Africa engagements (e.g., Wagner Group) could theoretically lead to non-consensual ground presence, but no signs of imminent state-level military invasion.  
- Rhetoric from Russian officials about spheres of influence in the South Caucasus or Central Asia, but no verified troop movements.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
- Prediction window: 61 days (May 1–July 1, 2025).  
- If the window were halved (30 days), probability would drop further, as new invasions typically take longer to plan/launch.  
- If doubled (122 days), probability might rise slightly as more time allows for unexpected crises, but Russia’s resource constraints and lack of indicators still keep odds low.  

(d) Justification  
Outside view base rate: Historically, US accusations of Russian invasion outside Ukraine have been extremely rare (only Georgia in 2008).  
Key shifts:  
- Russia’s committed manpower and logistics are largely tied down in Ukraine (strong evidence for low probability).  
- No credible intelligence leaks or news reports of Russian forces mobilizing on new borders (strong).  
- US diplomatic tone is cautious; officials prefer diplomatic sanctions over “invasion” language unless incontrovertible (moderate).  

Inside view adjustment: No substantial new risk factors or breaking developments point toward a rapid new ground invasion. Therefore, I maintain a probability close to the outside-view base rate with only a small upward adjustment for unforeseeable sudden moves (e.g., a surprise incursion from Transnistria into Moldova).  

Probability calibration  
I aim for a true probability forecast. A 9% chance implies that in 100 comparable 61-day windows, a US accusation would occur roughly 9 times. A 10-point swing to 19% would suggest clear signs of an invasion risk, which are absent. A downward adjustment into single digits reflects the strong evidence against a new incursion.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase question: “Will the US publicly accuse Russia of invading any country (besides Ukraine) by ground forces without consent before July 1 2025?”  
2. Base rate: US has accused Russia once (Georgia 2008) in 17 years, ~6% annualized; outside view ~9% for a 61-day window.  
3. Consistency: 9 out of 100 times, given similar geopolitical conditions, the US makes such an accusation.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Russia’s ground forces tied up in Ukraine (strong).  
   • No signals of new deployments in Georgia, Moldova, Africa (strong).  
   • US labels Syrian deployment as “intervention by invitation,” not “invasion” (moderate).  
   • US already uses strong language for non-military aggression but reserves “invasion” for clear unauthorized ground force movements (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: A rapid Russian move from Transnistria into Moldova would catch forecasters off guard, instantly raising US accusations.  
6. Status quo: No major new fronts have opened against Russia except Ukraine; the situation is relatively stable in other theatres.  

Probability: 9%
Predicted Probability: 9.0%

Analysis:
1. Paraphrase of question and resolution criteria  
   “Between now (2025-05-01) and July 1, 2025 (61 days), will the US publicly accuse Russia of sending ground forces to invade a country other than Ukraine?”

2. Source analysis  
   • CNN (2008 Georgia war): Reliable mainstream report—documents Bush admin calling Russia’s troops an “invasion” of sovereign Georgia. Factual quotes, high credibility.  
   • The Guardian (2008 Georgia war): High-quality outlet—records US officials (Rice, McCain, Obama) condemning Russia’s actions as aggression/invasion. Factual.  
   • CSIS (2021 hybrid aggression in Georgia): Respected think-tank. Details Russia’s post-2008 tactics in Georgia; no new cross-border ground invasions. Factual analysis.  
   • Perplexity summary of US accusations: Aggregates US language toward Russia. Confirms “invasion” label only for Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2022), while Syria and other theaters used “aggression”/“war crimes.” Source mix is uneven but patterns align with higher-quality reports.  
   • Asknews articles (Apr–May 2025 Russian rhetoric on Kherson, Moldova, South Caucasus, Africa): Numerous statements but all concern Russian actions in/around Ukraine or hybrid threats to neighboring states (e.g., South Caucasus, Moldova). No documented Russian ground invasion elsewhere, nor US accusations thereof.

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence:  
     – Historical US use of “invasion” term is confined to two major events (Georgia 2008, Ukraine 2022).  
   Moderate evidence:  
     – Russia’s broader rhetoric about “sphere of influence” in South Caucasus and threats in Moldova, but no confirmed troop entries.  
   Weak evidence:  
     – Russian Security Council Secretary’s warnings of NATO deployments (Apr 2025)—no actual ground invasion.  
     – Hybrid tactics (“borderization”) in Georgia remain below threshold of a new ground invasion.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – Forecast window: 61 days (0.17 years).  
   – Halved window (30 days): base probability ≈0.5×; doubled window (122 days): ≈2×.  
   – Annual base-rate ≈6% (1 event/17 years); for 61 days ≈1%. Scaling linearly, 30 days ≈0.5%, 122 days ≈2%.

5. Justification of inside view adjustment  
   – Outside view base-rate (6% annual) yields ~1% for our window.  
   – No credible signals of Russia planning a new ground invasion in Africa, Caucasus, or elsewhere before July. Russian troops remain massed in Ukraine; political costs of opening a second front are high.  
   – The US reserves “invasion” rhetoric for clear, large-scale ground operations. Hybrid or limited cross-border incidents (e.g., drone strikes, cyberattacks) elicit “aggression” or “violation” but not full “invasion” language.  
   – Slight upward adjustment (to ~3%) accounts for low-probability surprises (e.g., covert incursion into Moldova or Nagorno-Karabakh), but these scenarios remain remote and would require rapid US political response to qualify as a public “invasion” accusation.

Probability calibration  
Given the narrow historical precedent (one non-Ukraine accusation in 17 years) and lack of current indicators, the 3% estimate balances the low base‐rate with a small allowance for unexpected escalation.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will the US accuse Russia of invading a non-Ukraine country before July 1, 2025?” ✓  
2. Outside view base rate: ~6%/year → ~1% for 61 days. ✓  
3. Consistency check: “3 out of 100 times, US makes such an accusation in this window.” That matches rare historic precedent plus minor surprise risk. ✓  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Only Georgia (2008) is precedent for US “invasion” accusation. (Strong)  
   b) No credible military buildup outside Ukraine. (Moderate)  
   c) Russia heavily committed in Ukraine—unlikely to open new ground fronts. (Moderate)  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden covert operation in Moldova or South Caucasus could trigger an US accusation—unlikely given resource constraints but nonzero.  
6. Status quo: Russia continues current tactics without new land incursions; US sticks to “aggression” rhetoric. ✓

Predicted Probability: 3.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (condensed)
• RUSI 2023 retrospective on 2008 Georgia war – reputable UK think-tank; purely historical facts, minimal opinion.  
• CSIS Aug 2021 study on Russia’s hybrid pressure in Georgia – high quality; facts on troop presence, “borderisation,” objectives. Analytical opinions from scholars.  
• Politico Feb 2010 FOIA story on Bush-era debate – well-sourced history; no current relevance.  
• WSJ Jun 2024, WaPo Sep 2024 on Russian influence ops – first-tier US outlets; facts = new DOJ/State designations, opinions = US officials’ characterisations. Not about troop movements.  
• BBC Mar 2025 Black-Sea cease-fire story – high reliability; facts = US-brokered deal, quotes from leaders.  
• Asknews packet (Apr-May 2025) – mixture of Reuters, RFI, KBS, etc. All focused on Ukraine theatre and Russian propaganda. No mention of fresh ground operations outside Ukraine.

Overall: all sources are reliable for what they cover; none report Russian troops crossing a new international border since Feb 2022.

(b) Evidence analysis versus resolution criteria  
Strong weight (status-quo evidence)  
• Historical pattern: Only one U.S. “invasion” accusation outside Ukraine in 34 years (Georgia 2008).  
• Russian land forces tied down in Ukraine; large new incursion logistically costly inside 60 days.  
• No U.S. or NATO early-warning statements, satellite imagery leaks, or UNSC emergency meetings pointing to imminent moves into Moldova/Georgia.  

Moderate weight (risk-increasing)  
• Russian officials (Lavrov, Shoigu) reiterate claims on “Novorossiya” & former Soviet space (ISW 2025) – signals intent, but rhetoric not troop orders.  
• Borderisation in Georgia persists; a small thrust across the ABL could theoretically trigger an accusation, yet U.S. has previously treated these as “occupation,” not “new invasion.”  

Weak weight  
• Speculation in partisan or fringe outlets that Russia might “occupy all of Ukraine” or move on NATO states – largely opinion, no corroborating intel.  
• Cease-fire manoeuvring with U.S. could free resources, but timing tiny.

Net evidence: overwhelmingly supports “no new U.S. accusation” status quo.

(c) Timeframe
61 days remain (≈0.17 yr).  Halving the window (30 days) would lower risk roughly to 0.5 × current estimate; doubling (to 4 months) would raise it ≈2×, still low single-digits.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Base-rate (Poisson, 1 event/34 yr) → 0.5 % for 61 days.  
+0.3 %: elevated rhetoric & continuing Georgian/Moldovan flash-points.  
–0.1 %: Russia’s force constraints & diplomatic costs so late in high-casualty Ukraine war.  
Rounded inside-view = 0.7 % → I round to 1 % to reflect fat-tail uncertainty and avoid false precision.

Probability calibration
I expect about 1 out of 100 comparable 61-day periods (with 3-year-old major war in Ukraine ongoing) to see the U.S. level a fresh “invasion” accusation against Russia elsewhere.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will the U.S. publicly accuse Russia of invading a non-Ukrainian country before 1 Jul 2025?”  
2. Outside base rate 0.5 %; final 1 % remains anchored.  
3. “In 1 of 100 times, the accusation happens.” Sounds plausible.  
4. Key evidence: (i) only Georgia 2008 precedent; (ii) no current troop build-ups detected; (iii) Russian army overstretched in Ukraine; (iv) U.S. linguistic pattern—uses “occupation” not “invasion” for Syria/Georgia line-creep.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Russian column crosses into Moldova/Georgia under pretext of peacekeeping and U.S. labels it invasion. Would raise probability sharply.  
6. Status-quo (no new accusation) stable; nudged toward it.

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%

## Source Analysis

I'll analyze the provided sources for their quality, relevance, and reliability regarding US accusations of Russian invasions:

**Background Sources:**
1. **RUSI article on US-Georgia-Russia (2008)**: High-quality analysis documenting President Bush condemning Russia for "invading a sovereign neighboring state" during the Georgia conflict. Clear attribution of statements to officials.

2. **CSIS analysis on Russia's hybrid aggression against Georgia**: Detailed assessment from a reputable think tank describing Russia's 2008 invasion and subsequent occupation of ~20% of Georgian territory. Well-sourced with specific examples of Russian military activities.

3. **POLITICO article on US considering military options (2010)**: Reliable reporting with named sources revealing the Bush administration internally discussed but rejected military responses to Russia's 2008 Georgia invasion.

4. **WSJ & Washington Post articles on Russian influence operations**: High-quality reporting on US government accusations about Russian information operations. Less directly relevant to predicting new ground invasions.

5. **BBC article on Black Sea ceasefire**: Recent, reliable reporting on limited US-brokered ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, showing ongoing diplomatic engagement.

**Recent News Articles (May 2025):**
Most recent news focuses on Russia-Ukraine conflict developments rather than potential new invasions. Key themes include:
- Russian statements rejecting Ukraine's pre-1991 borders
- Trump administration's criticism of Russian attacks on Kyiv
- Russian threats against NATO deployment in Ukraine
- Russian statements suggesting territorial ambitions beyond Ukraine

The most credible information comes from direct quotes from US and Russian officials rather than analysis or commentary. No reports suggest imminent Russian plans to invade a new country.

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Historical pattern of US "invasion" accusations**: The US has only formally accused Russia of "invasion" regarding Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014/2022), despite other Russian military interventions. This establishes a high threshold for using "invasion" terminology.

2. **Russia's military capacity constraints**: Multiple sources indicate Russia remains heavily committed in Ukraine, significantly limiting its ability to launch another major invasion elsewhere within the short timeframe.

3. **Ongoing US-Russia diplomatic engagement**: Recent reporting confirms the US and Russia are engaged in ceasefire negotiations regarding Ukraine, suggesting partial diplomatic channels remain open.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Russian rhetoric about territorial ambitions**: Recent statements from Russian officials (particularly Lavrov in April 2025) suggest Russia views former Soviet territories as legitimately Russian, providing ideological foundations for potential future aggression.

2. **Trump's direct criticism of Putin**: Recent reporting shows Trump publicly calling on Putin to stop attacks in Ukraine, indicating willingness to criticize Russia publicly.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Vague Russian threats toward neighboring countries**: Russian officials have made threatening statements toward various neighbors, but these appear to be routine rhetorical positions rather than specific invasion plans.

2. **Opinion pieces predicting Russian territorial expansion**: Several sources contain speculation about Russian ambitions, but lack concrete evidence of imminent invasion plans.

## Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025 – just 2 months. This short timeframe significantly constrains probability:

1. **Historical invasion planning cycles**: Russia's past invasions (Georgia 2008, Ukraine 2014/2022) involved months of planning and preparation. The 2-month window provides limited time for planning and executing a new invasion.

2. **US accusation process**: For the US to formally accuse Russia would require:
   - Intelligence gathering on Russian activities
   - Actual invasion operations beginning
   - Internal government consultations
   - Formal public statements using specific "invasion" terminology

If the timeframe were halved to 1 month, probability would decrease substantially (perhaps by 50%) due to even less time for both invasion and accusation to materialize.

If doubled to 4 months, probability would increase moderately (perhaps by 30-50%) as it would provide more time for tensions to escalate in potential hotspots.

## Justification

Several compelling factors suggest a low probability:

1. **High threshold for US "invasion" accusations**: Historically, the US has formally accused Russia of "invasion" only in cases of clear territorial violation with ground forces. This suggests a high threshold unlikely to be met within 2 months.

2. **Russia's military capacity constraints**: Russia's military remains heavily engaged in Ukraine, constraining its ability to launch another major invasion elsewhere.

3. **Current diplomatic engagement**: The US and Russia appear engaged in discussions regarding Ukraine ceasefires, not suggesting an imminent breakdown preceding a new invasion elsewhere.

4. **Limited plausible invasion targets**: Most potential targets either:
   - Already have Russian troops present (not triggering new "invasion" accusations)
   - Are NATO members (extremely high risk for Russia)
   - Would require significant logistical preparation visible well in advance

5. **Short timeframe**: The 2-month window provides limited opportunity for Russia to plan and execute a new invasion AND for the US to gather intelligence and make formal public accusations.

The most plausible scenarios for a "Yes" resolution would involve:
- A sudden Russian expansion in Georgia beyond current occupation zones
- A manufactured crisis in Moldova/Transnistria leading to expanded Russian presence
- An unexpected intervention in a Central Asian state following internal instability

However, all these scenarios face significant constraints from Russia's current military commitments and would require rapid US decision to formally label such actions as an "invasion."

# Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 3%, I'll make adjustments based on the analyzed evidence:

**Factors decreasing probability:**
- Russia's military is heavily committed in Ukraine (-0.5%)
- The 2-month timeframe is very short for both invasion and accusation (-0.5%)
- Current US-Russia diplomatic engagement (-0.5%)

**Factors increasing probability:**
- Russian rhetoric suggesting territorial ambitions (+0.5%)
- Potential flashpoints in post-Soviet space (+0.5%)

The net adjustment is -0.5%, bringing my final estimate to 2.5%. This represents:
- Recognition of the low historical frequency of Russian invasions and US "invasion" accusations
- Acknowledgment of current constraints on Russian military capacity
- The short timeframe for events to unfold
- The potential for unexpected escalation in various flashpoints

# Checklist:
1. Before July 1, 2025, will the US accuse Russia of invading any country besides Ukraine by sending ground forces without government consent?
2. Base rate: ~3% based on historical frequency of Russian invasions and US accusations
3. 2-3 out of 100 times, the US would publicly accuse Russia of a new invasion within this 2-month period
4. Key evidence: Historical rarity of US "invasion" accusations; Russia's military commitment in Ukraine; Short 2-month window; Limited plausible invasion targets
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Russian intervention in Moldova/Transnistria triggered by manufactured crisis
6. Status quo of no new invasions likely to persist given constraints and timeframe

Probability: 2.5%
Predicted Probability: 2.5%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Documents:**
- **RUSI article (August 2008 conflict)**: High-quality analysis of US-Russia-Georgia conflict where President Bush explicitly accused Russia of invading "a sovereign neighboring state." Reliable factual account with clear official statements from Bush, Rice, McCain, and Obama.
- **CSIS paper on Russia's Hybrid Aggression**: 2021 academic analysis documenting Russia's 2008 ground invasion of Georgia and subsequent "borderization" tactics. Factual historical accounting with institutional analysis.
- **POLITICO (2010)**: Investigative reporting revealing internal US deliberations during 2008 Georgia crisis. Contains named-source statements from Hadley and other officials confirming consideration but rejection of military options.
- **WSJ article on Russian influence**: 2024 reporting on US accusations of Russian propaganda/influence operations, not related to military invasions.
- **Washington Post article (Sept 2024)**: Details US accusations about RT becoming an intelligence arm, not about military invasions.
- **BBC on Black Sea ceasefire (2025)**: Recent reporting on Russia-Ukraine negotiations with US involvement, focused on current conflict.

**AskNews Articles (April-May 2025):**
- Multiple May 1, 2025 articles about Russian accusations against Ukraine for drone attacks in Kherson.
- Several late April 2025 sources reporting Russian rejection of Ukraine's pre-1991 borders.
- April 2025 reports of Russian threats toward NATO members, including nuclear rhetoric from Sergei Shoigu.
- Coverage of Trump-Putin communications regarding Ukraine ceasefire.

None of the AskNews articles include US accusations of Russia invading any country beyond Ukraine in 2025.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Historical precedent exists - US explicitly accused Russia of invading Georgia in 2008 (Bush: "invading a sovereign neighboring state").
- No current US intelligence reports or official statements identifying Russian military buildups near borders of countries other than Ukraine.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Current US-Russia diplomatic engagement shows Trump administration pursuing negotiated resolution in Ukraine rather than escalatory rhetoric.
- Russian threatening statements toward NATO countries and South Caucasus (via Lavrov, Shoigu) signal continued tensions but not imminent action.
- Russian rejection of Ukraine's territorial integrity demonstrates aggressive stance on former Soviet territories.

**Weak evidence:**
- Seasonal factors (spring/summer historically favorable for military operations).
- Russian accusations of "Western occupation" plans in western Ukraine regions.
- Historical Russian opportunism during periods of Western distraction.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Prediction timeframe: 61 days (May 1 to July 1, 2025)

If halved (30 days): Probability would decrease further to ~1% as Russia would have even less time to plan, execute, and provoke US accusations regarding a new invasion.

If doubled (120 days): Probability would increase to perhaps 3-4%, allowing more time for current tensions to potentially escalate, especially in regions like Georgia, Moldova/Transnistria, or Baltic states.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 2%, current factors warrant minimal adjustment:

**Factors decreasing probability:**
- No evidence of Russian military preparations near non-Ukrainian borders (strong)
- Trump administration pursuing diplomatic approach with Russia (moderate)
- Russia strategically focused on securing gains in Ukraine rather than opening new fronts (moderate)
- Very short timeframe (61 days) limits Russia's ability to plan and execute new operations (moderate)

**Factors increasing probability:**
- Russian officials making threatening statements about NATO members and former Soviet territories (moderate)
- Ongoing Russian presence in Georgia creates potential for escalation (weak)
- Russian claims about "NATO encirclement" could be used to justify action (weak)

The most significant factor is the absence of any detected preparations for a new invasion, which substantially reduces the likelihood of a "Yes" outcome. Even if Russia took some limited military action, Trump's diplomatic approach makes it less likely the US would specifically use the term "invasion" compared to previous administrations.

## Probability calibration

The outside view gave us 2% probability. The strongest current evidence suggests this may even be slightly high given:
1. Absence of Russian military buildups near non-Ukrainian borders
2. Trump administration's focus on diplomatic resolution with Russia
3. Extremely short timeframe (61 days)
4. Russia's strategic focus on Ukraine

However, I should not underestimate the possibility of unexpected events or rapid escalations, particularly given Russian rhetoric about NATO countries and historical tensions in regions like Georgia.

The balance of evidence suggests the 2% outside view remains reasonable. While one could argue for a slight downward adjustment to 1-1.5%, the historical precedent (Georgia 2008) and ongoing tensions in multiple regions maintain the possibility that unexpected events could trigger a US accusation.

## Checklist:
1. Before July 1, 2025, will the US formally accuse Russia of sending ground troops to invade a non-Ukrainian country without that government's consent?
2. Outside view: ~2% over 2-month period based on historical frequency of US accusations of Russian invasions.
3. In 2 of 100 similar two-month periods, the US would accuse Russia of invading a new country.
4. Key evidence: No detected Russian military buildup near new borders; Trump pursuing diplomacy with Putin; Russia focused on Ukraine; But Russian threatening rhetoric persists.
5. Blind spot: Sudden limited Russian incursion into Georgian territory near South Ossetia could prompt unexpected US response.
6. Status quo favors continued focus on Ukraine without new fronts.

Predicted Probability: 2.0%

(a) Source analysis  
• RUSI article on US–Georgia–Russia (2008) – high-quality think-tank piece summarizing US condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Georgia. Facts and direct quotes from Bush, Rice, McCain, Obama. Strong evidence of how the US labels Russian ground incursions without consent. (September 2024)  
• CSIS report on Russia’s hybrid strategy in Georgia – respected policy paper documenting Russia’s continued military control since 2008, but no fresh ground invasions. Useful for assessing Moscow’s likely next moves. (August 2021)  
• Politico “US pondered military use in Georgia” – credible news report detailing US internal debates in 2008. Confirms US reluctance to use force against Russia despite clear invasion. (Feb 2010)  
• WSJ on Russia’s election influence (May 2025) – reliable reporting on DOJ accusations of covert propaganda and influence operations, but pertains to information warfare, not military invasion. Shows US readiness to publicly accuse Russia of non-kinetic aggression.  
• Washington Post on RT sanctions (Sept 2024) – authoritative coverage of US designating RT as an intelligence arm. Reflects US willingness to use strong language (“covert arm of intelligence”) but still stops short of calling media operations an “invasion.”  
• BBC on Black Sea ceasefire (May 2025) – top-tier journalism on US-brokered Black Sea deal. Russia’s activities in the Black Sea are maritime and do not represent a new ground invasion.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts)  
- No recent credible reports or intelligence indicators of Russian ground-force deployments into any country besides Ukraine.  
- Russia’s ground forces remain heavily committed in Ukraine, constraining capacity for a new front.  
- Historically, US has only formally accused Russia of invading Georgia in 2008; other interventions (Syria) have been characterized differently due to consent from local authorities.  

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)  
- US political environment: the Biden/Trump debate and midterm elections make Washington wary of any steps that might escalate with Russia.  
- US readiness to publicly condemn non-military Russian aggression (e.g., election meddling, RT sanctions) but not to escalate to formal “invasion” language without clear ground operations.  

Weak evidence (small shifts)  
- Ongoing Russia-Africa engagements (e.g., Wagner Group) could theoretically lead to non-consensual ground presence, but no signs of imminent state-level military invasion.  
- Rhetoric from Russian officials about spheres of influence in the South Caucasus or Central Asia, but no verified troop movements.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
- Prediction window: 61 days (May 1–July 1, 2025).  
- If the window were halved (30 days), probability would drop further, as new invasions typically take longer to plan/launch.  
- If doubled (122 days), probability might rise slightly as more time allows for unexpected crises, but Russia’s resource constraints and lack of indicators still keep odds low.  

(d) Justification  
Outside view base rate: Historically, US accusations of Russian invasion outside Ukraine have been extremely rare (only Georgia in 2008).  
Key shifts:  
- Russia’s committed manpower and logistics are largely tied down in Ukraine (strong evidence for low probability).  
- No credible intelligence leaks or news reports of Russian forces mobilizing on new borders (strong).  
- US diplomatic tone is cautious; officials prefer diplomatic sanctions over “invasion” language unless incontrovertible (moderate).  

Inside view adjustment: No substantial new risk factors or breaking developments point toward a rapid new ground invasion. Therefore, I maintain a probability close to the outside-view base rate with only a small upward adjustment for unforeseeable sudden moves (e.g., a surprise incursion from Transnistria into Moldova).  

Probability calibration  
I aim for a true probability forecast. A 9% chance implies that in 100 comparable 61-day windows, a US accusation would occur roughly 9 times. A 10-point swing to 19% would suggest clear signs of an invasion risk, which are absent. A downward adjustment into single digits reflects the strong evidence against a new incursion.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase question: “Will the US publicly accuse Russia of invading any country (besides Ukraine) by ground forces without consent before July 1 2025?”  
2. Base rate: US has accused Russia once (Georgia 2008) in 17 years, ~6% annualized; outside view ~9% for a 61-day window.  
3. Consistency: 9 out of 100 times, given similar geopolitical conditions, the US makes such an accusation.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Russia’s ground forces tied up in Ukraine (strong).  
   • No signals of new deployments in Georgia, Moldova, Africa (strong).  
   • US labels Syrian deployment as “intervention by invitation,” not “invasion” (moderate).  
   • US already uses strong language for non-military aggression but reserves “invasion” for clear unauthorized ground force movements (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: A rapid Russian move from Transnistria into Moldova would catch forecasters off guard, instantly raising US accusations.

   – The US reserves “invasion” rhetoric for clear, large-scale ground operations. Hybrid or limited cross-border incidents (e.g., drone strikes, cyberattacks) elicit “aggression” or “violation” but not full “invasion” language.  
   – Slight upward adjustment (to ~3%) accounts for low-probability surprises (e.g., covert incursion into Moldova or Nagorno-Karabakh), but these scenarios remain remote and would require rapid US political response to qualify as a public “invasion” accusation.

Probability calibration  
Given the narrow historical precedent (one non-Ukraine accusation in 17 years) and lack of current indicators, the 3% estimate balances the low base‐rate with a small allowance for unexpected escalation.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will the US accuse Russia of invading a non-Ukraine country before July 1, 2025?” ✓  
2. Outside view base rate: ~6%/year → ~1% for 61 days. ✓  
3. Consistency check: “3 out of 100 times, US makes such an accusation in this window.” That matches rare historic precedent plus minor surprise risk. ✓  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Only Georgia (2008) is precedent for US “invasion” accusation. (Strong)  
   b) No credible military buildup outside Ukraine. (Moderate)  
   c) Russia heavily committed in Ukraine—unlikely to open new ground fronts. (Moderate)  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden covert operation in Moldova or South Caucasus could trigger an US accusation—unlikely given resource constraints but nonzero.  
6. Status quo: Russia continues current tactics without new land incursions; US sticks to “aggression” rhetoric. ✓

Probability: 3%
Predicted Probability: 3.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (condensed)
• RUSI 2023 retrospective on 2008 Georgia war – reputable UK think-tank; purely historical facts, minimal opinion.  
• CSIS Aug 2021 study on Russia’s hybrid pressure in Georgia – high quality; facts on troop presence, “borderisation,” objectives. Analytical opinions from scholars.  
• Politico Feb 2010 FOIA story on Bush-era debate – well-sourced history; no current relevance.  
• WSJ Jun 2024, WaPo Sep 2024 on Russian influence ops – first-tier US outlets; facts = new DOJ/State designations, opinions = US officials’ characterisations. Not about troop movements.  
• BBC Mar 2025 Black-Sea cease-fire story – high reliability; facts = US-brokered deal, quotes from leaders.  
• Asknews packet (Apr-May 2025) – mixture of Reuters, RFI, KBS, etc. All focused on Ukraine theatre and Russian propaganda. No mention of fresh ground operations outside Ukraine.

Overall: all sources are reliable for what they cover; none report Russian troops crossing a new international border since Feb 2022.

(b) Evidence analysis versus resolution criteria  
Strong weight (status-quo evidence)  
• Historical pattern: Only one U.S. “invasion” accusation outside Ukraine in 34 years (Georgia 2008).  
• Russian land forces tied down in Ukraine; large new incursion logistically costly inside 60 days.  
• No U.S. or NATO early-warning statements, satellite imagery leaks, or UNSC emergency meetings pointing to imminent moves into Moldova/Georgia.  

Moderate weight (risk-increasing)  
• Russian officials (Lavrov, Shoigu) reiterate claims on “Novorossiya” & former Soviet space (ISW 2025) – signals intent, but rhetoric not troop orders.  
• Borderisation in Georgia persists; a small thrust across the ABL could theoretically trigger an accusation, yet U.S. has previously treated these as “occupation,” not “new invasion.”  

Weak weight  
• Speculation in partisan or fringe outlets that Russia might “occupy all of Ukraine” or move on NATO states – largely opinion, no corroborating intel.  
• Cease-fire manoeuvring with U.S. could free resources, but timing tiny.

Net evidence: overwhelmingly supports “no new U.S. accusation” status quo.

(c) Timeframe
61 days remain (≈0.17 yr).  Halving the window (30 days) would lower risk roughly to 0.5 × current estimate; doubling (to 4 months) would raise it ≈2×, still low single-digits.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Base-rate (Poisson, 1 event/34 yr) → 0.5 % for 61 days.  
+0.3 %: elevated rhetoric & continuing Georgian/Moldovan flash-points.  
–0.1 %: Russia’s force constraints & diplomatic costs so late in high-casualty Ukraine war.  
Rounded inside-view = 0.7 % → I round to 1 % to reflect fat-tail uncertainty and avoid false precision.

Probability calibration
I expect about 1 out of 100 comparable 61-day periods (with 3-year-old major war in Ukraine ongoing) to see the U.S. level a fresh “invasion” accusation against Russia elsewhere.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will the U.S. publicly accuse Russia of invading a non-Ukrainian country before 1 Jul 2025?”  
2. Outside base rate 0.5 %; final 1 % remains anchored.  
3. “In 1 of 100 times, the accusation happens.” Sounds plausible.  
4. Key evidence: (i) only Georgia 2008 precedent; (ii) no current troop build-ups detected; (iii) Russian army overstretched in Ukraine; (iv) U.S. linguistic pattern—uses “occupation” not “invasion” for Syria/Georgia line-creep.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Russian column crosses into Moldova/Georgia under pretext of peacekeeping and U.S. labels it invasion. Would raise probability sharply.  
6. Status-quo (no new accusation) stable; nudged toward it.

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%...
