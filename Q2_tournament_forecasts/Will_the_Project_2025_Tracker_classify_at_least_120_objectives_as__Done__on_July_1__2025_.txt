Analysis:
The key to projecting whether ≥120 objectives will be “Done” by July 1, 2025 is understanding the tracker’s historical pace and update cadence. I need (a) the total universe of objectives, (b) criteria for marking “Done,” (c) counts of objectives completed over time, and (d) how often updates are published. This lets me build a base‐rate trend and extrapolate the likely count by the cutoff date.

Analysis:
The key current information needed is the latest count of “Done” objectives on the Project 2025 Tracker and any recent updates or commentary on its progress toward the 120-objective threshold. We’ll want:
- The most recent objective count published on project2025.observer or related changelogs.
- Any news or blog posts covering milestones or setbacks.
- Discussions from the Keep_Track subreddit or other public forums highlighting recent “Done” additions and pipeline velocity.
These will help us assess whether the pace and likely execution will reach ≥120 objectives by July 1, 2025.

Here’s a concise summary of Teirstein’s April 30 2025 Grist article:

• Project 2025 roadmap and tracker  
  – Project 2025 is a 900-page policy blueprint drafted by the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups, outlining 300+ objectives for a second Trump term.  
  – A crowdsourced “Project 2025 Tracker” (Keep_Track subreddit) finds that, in under four months, the administration has fully implemented roughly one-third of those objectives and has another 60+ “in progress.”  

• Key areas of rapid executive-branch action (bypassing Congress)  
  – Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI): references to DEI have been scrubbed from government documents and agencies.  
  – Department of Education: moves begun to dismantle it.  
  – Science grants: funding freezes across multiple agencies.  
  – Climate & environment: about 20 percent of Project 2025’s proposed measures have been enacted—examples include expanded fossil-fuel drilling on public lands, cuts to green-program grants, and rollbacks of climate statutes.  

• Major executive orders and agency directives  
  – “Unleashing American Energy” (Day 1): calls for revisiting the EPA’s “endangerment finding” (the legal basis for U.S. greenhouse-gas controls). In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin formally initiated reconsideration of that finding and related regulations.  
  – Interior Department: environmental and social impact reviews for oil and gas projects on public lands have been truncated from 1–2 years to as little as 14 days.  
  – Energy Department: directives to fast-track liquefied natural gas exports and to freeze funding under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.  

• Legal pushback  
  – Many of these actions are already facing lawsuits. Judges have ordered partial unfreezing of green-bank funds; courts are poised to review challenges under the Clean Air Act, NEPA, and other statutes.  
  – Michael Gerrard (Columbia’s Sabin Center) notes that the original Trump administration frequently lost in court due to procedural missteps—and so far this term appears to be doing “even worse.”  

• Voices quoted  
  – Paul Dans, former Project 2025 director: “It’s actually way beyond my wildest dreams.” (via Politico)  
  – David Willett, League of Conservation Voters: suggests Project 2025’s drafters assumed future administrations would stay within legal bounds—and that White House lawyers would seek “decisive action” from Congress when needed.  

No attempt is made in the article to assess long-term success or failure; the focus is on the rapid, executive-driven implementation of a substantial portion of Project 2025’s agenda—and the legal and political contests those moves have already spawned.

<Summary source="https://www.afscme.org/blog/we-must-fight-to-stop-project-2025-in-its-tracks">
Below is a summary of the AFSCME article “We must fight to stop Project 2025 in its tracks” (April 16, 2025). It highlights the key objectives of Project 2025 (cited by page number) and the administration’s actions through April 2025, plus named voices from affected workers.

1. Project 2025 overview  
• A roughly 900-page blueprint aiming to “harm working families and public services” by cutting health care and retirement benefits, canceling contracts, and slashing billions in funding.  
• Trump, as a candidate, claimed ignorance of the plan; his campaign said its policies would never be implemented. AFSCME says within 90 days of the new administration, one-third of the agenda is already in motion.

2. Unions & labor rights  
• THEN (pp. 81–82): Ban or weaken public-sector and federal-employee unions.  
• NOW: Executive order eliminating collective bargaining rights for nearly one million federal workers.

3. Civil service “Schedule F”  
• THEN (p. 73): Reintroduce Schedule F to install at-will appointees in civil service.  
• NOW: Schedule F reinstated on Day 1; tens of thousands of civil servants have been fired.

4. Head Start cuts  
• THEN (p. 482): Eliminate Head Start, serving 833,000+ children in poverty.  
• NOW: Funding freeze has thrown Head Start into disarray; further cuts planned.  
• Quote: “I’m really fearful for the next generation if we lose funding.” – Becky Carlson, Head Start teacher (AFSCME Council 65).

5. Public Service Loan Forgiveness  
• THEN (p. 354): Kill PSLF and roll back student-loan forgiveness.  
• NOW: Department of Education gutted; administration seeks to eliminate the entire department.  
• Quote: “I thought I was going to die with debt… Now I can finally breathe.” – Laura Morand, PSLF recipient.

6. National Labor Relations Board  
• THEN (p. 615): Fire key NLRB appointees to cripple the agency.  
• NOW: Firings have made unionizing and resolving labor disputes much harder.

7. Prescription drug prices  
• THEN (p. 465): Remove Medicare’s power to lower drug costs (e.g., insulin).  
• NOW: Administration scrapped $2 co-pays for many medicines used by Medicare retirees.

8. Tax breaks for the wealthy  
• THEN (p. 696): Hand out billions in tax breaks to corporations and the top 1%.  
• NOW: A budget plan is advancing through Congress to deliver trillions in breaks to billionaires while cutting essential services.

9. Low-Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP)  
• THEN (p. 301): Restrict heating-assistance program for low-income families.  
• NOW: Program staff and 10,000 HHS employees have been laid off.

10. Voice of America  
• THEN (p. 242): Cut budget for U.S. Agency for Global Media (Voice of America).  
• NOW: Agency unlawfully shut down in March.

11. Office of Management and Budget  
• THEN: Russell Vought (Project 2025 architect) aimed to gut public services and empower billionaires.  
• NOW: Vought tapped to head OMB.

12. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  
• THEN (p. 837): Abolish the CFPB.  
• NOW: CFPB offices closed, staff sent home; agency weakened but not yet eliminated.

Overall, AFSCME frames these steps as the administration “unleashing” Project 2025’s agenda to roll back worker protections and cut public services.

Disclaimer: The extraction of the article appears to be incomplete past the section on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. What follows summarizes only the content provided.

Source: “The Reality of Project 2025,” Red Wine and Blue (progressive news/opinion site)

Overview  
• Project 2025’s authors have been placed in top‐level Trump administration roles and are already implementing its agenda.  
• Only 4 percent of voters view Project 2025 positively, prompting this tracker to document federal‐level actions and suggest “ways to fight back.”

1. Christian Nationalism and Reproductive Rights  
• HHS has withheld $27.5 million in Title X funding from Planned Parenthood and other family‐planning providers—already down by over 1 million patients annually compared to Trump’s first term.  
• Trump‐nominated Supreme Court justices overturned Roe v. Wade; while no federal abortion ban yet exists, the administration has:  
  – Reversed major federal abortion‐rights protections.  
  – Ended support for service members seeking fertility treatments or out‐of‐state abortions.  
  – Inserted “personhood” language (defining embryos as children) into federal policy.  
• HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Fox News Trump asked him to “study” the safety of mifepristone, despite two decades of FDA approval and endorsements from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the AMA.  
• Administration reviewing medication abortion; AG Pam Bondi (former Florida AG) “would love to work with” state AGs suing telehealth abortion providers.  
• Over 250 instances of the word “abortion” have been removed from government websites and documents.  

2. Public Education  
• March 20, 2025 executive order directing Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to “facilitate the closure” of the Department of Education, even though only Congress can legally abolish it.  
• Administration cuts to date:  
  – $900 million in DoEd funding.  
  – Fired 50 percent of department staff.  
  – National Center for Education Statistics shrunk from ~100 employees to 3.  
• Head Start programs serve 800,000 children; grant freezes in January blocked funds for 20,000 students in 23 states, shutting down or threatening shutdowns of local programs for 10+ days. Five of ten regional offices closed in April (impacts on 800 grantees serving 318,000 kids).  
• Fiscal Year 2026 draft budget proposes eliminating Head Start entirely.  
• Title I funding: latest budget cuts ~25 percent; layoffs of data‐analysis staff undermine equitable funding allocations; proposal to replace targeted grants with broad state block grants.  
• Executive order promotes private‐school vouchers; Congress considering the “Educational Choice for Children Act” to create dollar‐for‐dollar tax credits for voucher donors.  

3. Federal Student Aid and Loan Programs  
• Republican‐led states sued to block the SAVE Plan for eight million borrowers; courts appear likely to strike down SAVE and two other repayment plans; Congress may repeal them.  
• Department sources say “SAVE is not coming back in any way, shape, or form.”  
• Employee furloughs and firings may disrupt disbursement of Pell Grants, federal loans, and FAFSA processing affecting 6 million recipients/applicants.  

4. Labor and DEI in Education  
• DHS ended TSA collective bargaining; education employees expect similar actions against teachers’ unions.  
• (Article truncates here, but begins to describe an executive order removing funding from any schools with Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs.)

Key Named Sources & Quotes  
• Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (HHS Sec.): “Trump has asked me to study the safety of abortion pills…” (Fox News)  
• American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists & American Medical Association: mifepristone is safer than Tylenol or Viagra and can be life-saving.  
• Former AG Pam Bondi: would “love to work with” state AGs suing abortion providers.  
• DoEd employee (unnamed): “We’ve been told ‘SAVE’ is not coming back in any way, shape, or form.”

Key facts and figures  
• Project 2025: a 922-page conservative policy playbook by the Heritage Foundation and former Trump administration officials.  
• Tracker launch: under two months into Trump’s second term.  
• Progress to date: 36% of Project 2025’s objectives marked “completed.”  
• Time remaining (as of Feb. 28): 1,423 days left in the term, shown via a live countdown.  
• Site traffic: ~50,000–100,000 daily visitors, ~10% from outside the U.S.  

Origins and methodology  
• Creator: Adrienne Cobb, archaeologist and moderator of r/Keep_Track (183,000 members), who manually read all chapters of the Project 2025 document, extracting every explicit “objective” (i.e., any direct call to action).  
• Collaborator: Reddit user u/mollynaquafina, who converted Cobb’s spreadsheet into a public website with a visual progress bar, filters, charts, and timelines.  
• Tracking process: Cobb monitors social media, news outlets, and federal websites; flags news events that match Project 2025 objectives; updates the spreadsheet, which in turn updates the site.  

Site features  
• Overall progress bar (blue) showing percentage complete.  
• Filters by federal agency, subject area (e.g., DEIA, energy), and status.  
• “Completed” objectives are highlighted with green bubbles linking to:  
   – The specific page citation in the Project 2025 document  
   – A news article confirming execution (e.g., CDC ending gender-identity data collection; DoD reversing transgender service policy)  
• Chart and timeline views for holistic tracking.  
• Intentional neutral, factual language so both supporters and opponents can see what has been done.  

Quotes from named sources  
• Adrienne Cobb: “Project 2025 is one of the biggest threats to democracy…most people don’t have time to read a 900-page document. So I set out to read it myself and extract the objectives.”  
• Cobb on Trump’s pace: “By the time ‘the people’ have a chance to organize against a particular action, the administration has already moved on to the next objective.”  
• u/mollynaquafina: “I was very intentional about using factual and neutral language…so supporters can ask themselves, ‘Is this what I signed up for?’”  

Future plans  
• Translate the tracker into multiple languages based on user demand.  
• Continue manual news monitoring and site updates to reflect real-time progress.

Here is a concise summary of Erica York’s May 13, 2025 Tax Foundation article “Budget Reconciliation: Tracking the 2025 Trump Tax Cuts”:

Source: Tax Foundation (Erica York)

1. Latest Updates  
- Adds details on the House GOP’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill markup and new tariff estimates  
- Reflects Trump administration tariff actions  
- Notes House adoption of the Senate-amended budget resolution  

2. Key Findings  
- Extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) would:  
  • Reduce federal revenues by $4.5 trillion (2025–2034)  
  • Raise long-run GDP by 1.1% (offsetting $710 billion or 16% of revenue loss)  
  • Increase long-run GNP by 0.4% (some gains flow to foreigners via interest payments)  
- President Trump’s proposals include permanent TCJA extension, no taxes on tips/overtime/Social Security benefits, an auto-loan interest deduction for U.S.-made cars, plus higher import tariffs  
- Budget reconciliation will be used to enact tax cuts and related spending/debt-limit changes  
- Separately, Trump’s tariffs are estimated to raise revenue but reduce output  

3. “The Latest” Estimates  
- May 13, 2025: House “One Big Beautiful” bill (under markup) would boost long-run GDP by 0.6% and cut revenues by $4.0 trillion (2025–2034) on a conventional basis  
- May 5, 2025: Tariffs imposed as of May 2025 would raise $2.1 trillion (2025–2034) while reducing U.S. economic output by 0.8% in the long run  
- April 10, 2025: House adopted Senate’s amended budget resolution allowing:  
  • $5.3 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts (composed of $3.8 trillion assumed “costless” under current policy + $1.5 trillion additional deficits)  
  • $521 billion in defense and immigration spending increases  
  • At least $4 billion in spending cuts  
  • Up to $5 trillion increase in the debt limit  
- April 2, 2025: Senate updated its resolution to mirror House instructions and cap deficit-financed tax cuts at $5.3 trillion, plus up to $5 trillion debt-limit increase  
- February 25, 2025: House budget resolution starts reconciliation, permitting a $4.5 trillion deficit increase for tax cuts if accompanied by $1.7 trillion in spending cuts (cuts above or below adjust the cap dollar-for-dollar)  
- February 21, 2025: Senate approved its own resolution to start reconciliation but does not permit any tax cuts  

4. May 12 House Ways and Means Pre-Mark Text  
- Cuts taxes by less than budget resolution instructions, suggesting either shortfalls in planned spending cuts or room for negotiation  

5. Preliminary Analysis of May 12 Text  
- Long-run GDP +0.6%  
- Hours worked +794,000 full-time equivalent jobs  
- Long-run GNP <+0.05%  
- Wages –0.1%  
- Capital stock –0.2%  
- 10-year conventional revenue loss: $4.048 trillion  
- 10-year dynamic revenue loss (incorporating GDP effects): $3.3 trillion (18.8% smaller)  
- Prevents tax increases on 62% of taxpayers vs. TCJA expiration  
- Narrows and sunsets key pro-growth provisions (e.g., bonus depreciation, R&D expensing), reducing economic benefits and adding complexity  

6. Trump’s Campaign-Trail Proposals (reiterated March 4 joint address)  
- Permanence for TCJA, SALT deduction restoration, lower corporate rate for domestic production, various income exemptions, repeal of green energy credits, steep new tariffs  

7. Article’s Design Analysis  
- Some Trump proposals (permanent expensing for machinery, equipment, R&D) are efficient for long-run growth  
- Others (tips and Social Security income exemptions) are poorly designed with muted growth impact  
- Reliance on tariffs to offset tax-cut costs is highly distortive and carries significant economic downsides

<Perplexity_report>
Query: Provide a detailed summary of the Project 2025 Tracker: its objectives, classification criteria for marking objectives as “Done”, historical counts of objectives marked “Done” over time, and the update frequency on the Keep_Track subreddit.
# Project 2025 Tracker: Objectives, Classification Criteria, and Historical Implementation Data  

## Summary of Key Findings  
The Project 2025 Tracker is a resource developed to monitor the implementation of policy proposals outlined in the Heritage Foundation’s *Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise*, a 920-page blueprint for reshaping federal governance. As of May 2025, approximately **32–36%** of Project 2025’s domestic policy objectives have been implemented or are in progress under the Trump administration[4][10][54]. The tracker categorizes progress across 20 federal agencies and provides granular updates on executive actions, regulatory changes, and legislative priorities[1][2][9].  

---

## 1. Objectives of the Project 2025 Tracker  

### 1.1 Centralized Monitoring of Policy Implementation  
The tracker aims to provide a comprehensive, real-time overview of efforts to enact Project 2025’s agenda, which includes dismantling environmental protections, restructuring federal agencies, and rolling back diversity initiatives[1][6][33]. Developed collaboratively by organizations such as the **Center for Progressive Reform** and **Governing for Impact**, it serves as a watchdog tool for journalists, policymakers, and advocacy groups[2][9].  

### 1.2 Promoting Accountability and Transparency  
By linking specific administrative actions to Project 2025’s proposals, the tracker highlights the administration’s adherence to the blueprint despite public disavowals from Trump campaign officials[10][33][54]. For example, it documents the replacement of nonpartisan civil servants with political appointees and the elimination of climate-focused programs[10][55].  

### 1.3 Public Education and Mobilization  
The tracker educates citizens on the practical impacts of Project 2025, such as cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and scientific research funding[4][55][57]. Platforms like Reddit’s *Keep_Track* subreddit and *Watch2025.org* enable community contributions to refine tracking accuracy[56][58].  

---

## 2. Classification Criteria for Marking Objectives as “Done”  

### 2.1 Direct Implementation of Proposed Policies  
An objective is marked “Done” when the administration enacts a policy *verbatim* from Project 2025. Examples include:  
- **Elimination of diversity-focused grants**: The Department of Education terminated funding for programs addressing racial disparities in STEM education[10][55].  
- **Agency consolidation**: Merging the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Census Bureau, and Bureau of Labor Statistics into a single entity[33].  
- **Regulatory rollbacks**: Removing “sexual orientation and gender identity” protections from federal rules[10][33].  

### 2.2 Partial Completion and “In Progress” Status  
Objectives are tagged as “In Progress” for multi-phase initiatives, such as:  
- **Privatizing天气预报 services**: Initial steps include canceling contracts with academic climate researchers[54].  
- **Medicaid work requirements**: Pilot programs launched in five states as of April 2025[57].  

### 2.3 Executive Orders and Personnel Appointments  
The tracker counts nominations of Project 2025 contributors to key roles as progress. For instance:  
- **Russell Vought** (Project 2025 author) appointed Director of the Office of Management and Budget[33].  
- **Tom Homan** (blueprint contributor) named “border czar”[33].  

---

## 3. Historical Counts of Objectives Marked “Done”  

### 3.1 Timeline of Implementation  
- **January 2025**: 18% of objectives completed, focusing on EPA staffing cuts and DEI program terminations[4][73].  
- **February 2025**: 32% achieved, including withdrawal from the World Health Organization and elimination of the FTC’s antitrust division[54][59].

<Summary source="https://heatmap.news/politics/project-2025-tracker">
Here’s what Heatmap’s February 17, 2025 article reports about the Project 2025 Tracker:

Facts & Statistics  
• 25 days into the administration (mid-February 2025), 32% of Project 2025’s measurable objectives were “implemented or in progress.”  
• Tracker author Adrienne Cobb (aka “Rustic Gorilla”) pulled ~300 clearly stated, measurable objectives from the Heritage Foundation’s 920-page Project 2025 blueprint.  
• By department (per Cobb’s tracker):  
  – USAID objectives: ~92% complete  
  – Department of Energy: ~40% complete (7 of 19 objectives done)  
  – Environmental Protection Agency and Department of the Interior: each ~40% complete  
• Many remaining objectives involve eliminating DOE offices (e.g. the Loan Program office, Clean Energy Demonstrations) and longer-term goals (e.g. “expanding natural gas infrastructure”).

Named Opinions & Context  
• Cobb on civil-rights/education goals: media focus has been on headline items (“abolish the Department of Education”), while rollbacks of disabled-student protections have drawn little attention.  
• Cobb on early implementation patterns: the administration is hitting “low-hanging fruit” via executive action—targeting LGBTQ-rights protections and DEI initiatives, which are quick to undo and less likely to prompt public outcry.  
• Energy-policy rollbacks already enacted include reversing Biden’s pause on LNG exports and suspending Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding for clean-energy projects. A federal judge ordered those funds reinstated, but Pennsylvania alleges they remain withheld in defiance of appropriations and court orders—exceeding even Project 2025’s call for repeal of those laws.

Tracker Background & Reception  
• Cobb launched the tracker in January 2025, after previously running trackers on the Mueller Report and personnel churn in both Trump administrations (“45 Chaos” and “47 Chaos”).  
• She designed it as a “methodical and quantitative” way to help people parse ~900 pages and ~300 objectives.  
• Cobb says community response has been strong—she believes that widespread concern about Project 2025’s potential impact has driven interest and that collaborative input is welcome to keep the tracker up to date.

<Summary source="https://grist.org/accountability/project-2025-tracker-trump-environmental-policy-legal-constitutional-crisis/">
Here’s a concise summary of Zoya Teirstein’s April 30, 2025 Grist article:

• Project 2025 blueprint  
  – A roughly 900-page policy roadmap authored by the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups, with contributions from at least 140 former Trump‐administration officials.  
  – Proposes some 300+ objectives, including replacing career civil servants with political appointees, privatizing government weather services, rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, dismantling the Department of Education, freezing federal science grants, expanding fossil-fuel extraction, and repealing climate statutes.  
  – As of last fall, only 13 percent of Americans supported the plan; Trump publicly claimed to know nothing about it.

• Implementation so far  
  – According to the crowdsourced Project 2025 Tracker (Keep_Track subreddit), fewer than four months into his term Trump has “done” roughly one-third of the blueprint’s objectives (≈100+ items) and has another 60+ “in progress.”  
  – A separate tracker by Governing for Impact and the Center for Progressive Reform finds about one-fifth of the plan’s climate/environment measures implemented—examples include boosting drilling on public lands, cutting grants for green programs, and weakening climate statutes.  
  – Trump has signed only five laws to date (the lowest first-term count since 1953) but has used executive actions heavily.

• Key executive orders and agency moves  
  – Day 1 “Unleashing American Energy” order bundles multiple Project 2025 suggestions, notably directing EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to reconsider the Clean Air Act’s endangerment finding (the legal basis for most U.S. climate rules).  
  – EPA is moving to freeze or eliminate funding for recycling education, the “green bank,” and the Office of Environmental Justice—some of which courts have already ordered partially restored.  
  – Interior Department has shortened environmental reviews for oil and gas leases from up to two years to as few as 14 days, and is advancing drilling/mining under a declared (and contested) “energy emergency.”  
  – Energy Department is fast-tracking new liquefied natural gas export approvals and attempting to claw back Inflation Reduction Act climate spending—both under active legal challenge.

• Named expert perspectives  
  – Paul Dans (former Project 2025 director) told Politico: “It’s actually way beyond my wildest dreams” how much has been accomplished.  
  – James Goodwin (Center for Progressive Reform) calls these measures “the stuff that doesn’t require much process,” contrasting them with gridlocked legislation.  
  – Michael Gerrard (Columbia’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law) warns the administration’s aggressive tactics are already facing—and often losing—court challenges.  
  – David Willett (League of Conservation Voters) notes the blueprint repeatedly urges staying “within the bounds of the law,” suggesting its drafters assumed legal compliance by future administrations.

• Townley (The Conversation): although Elon Musk is a high-profile influence on Trump, Vought “arguably” wields more power behind the scenes.  
• Vought is “fully committed to a radical overhaul” of the presidency’s structure.  
• Cited quote from Vought: he has vowed to “be the person that crushes the deep state.”  
• His “deep religious convictions” drive his belief that government and public life should embed more Christianity.  

Less-reliable or unnamed information  
• It is “rumoured” Vought will take over running the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) from Elon Musk (origin of this claim not named).  

Overall portrayal  
Townley portrays Vought as a low-profile but highly influential architect of the administration’s agenda, driven by ideological and religious commitments, and poised to expand his reach (e.g., via the rumored Doge role).

<Summary source="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/15/how-trumps-early-actions-compare-project-2025">
Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the provided Inside Higher Ed article and does not include additional sources or interpretation.

Facts and figures  
• In President Trump’s first 85 days (about 12 weeks), roughly one-third of the approximately 50 higher-education policy recommendations in Project 2025 have been fully or partially executed, per Inside Higher Ed’s analysis.  
• More than half of Trump’s executive orders across all sectors align with Heritage Foundation recommendations, according to The Wall Street Journal.  
• Nearly half of the 11 higher-ed provisions in the 2024 Republican Party platform show progress.  
• Nearly half of Max Eden’s 28 December 2024 recommendations (from his AEI-by-way-of-White House opinion piece) have been fully or partially completed.  
• On March 7, the federal antisemitism task force pulled $400 million in research funds from Columbia University, issuing 10 demands for restoration; Columbia has met nine but funds are not yet reinstated.  
• The administration has revoked over 1,000 international student visas linked to pro-Palestinian campus protests, per Inside Higher Ed’s tracking.

Named opinions (reliable)  
• Sara Partridge (associate director, higher education policy, Center for American Progress): “Project 2025 really set out to destroy the federal role in education as we know it, and this administration has already taken major steps to weaken it.”  
• Former Project 2025 director (unnamed in article) told Politico in March that Trump’s agenda so far has been “beyond [his] wildest dreams” and “very much in line with what Project 2025 has called for,” including actions both within and exceeding executive power.  
• Frederick Hess (director, education policy studies, American Enterprise Institute): Project 2025 is “not worth any time” and no different from other think-tank playbooks.

Key examples of divergence and overlap  
• Project 2025 calls for moving federal student-loan programs to the Treasury; Trump plans to shift them to the Small Business Administration.  
• Upcoming expected executive orders aim to:  
  – Prevent accreditors from imposing DEI standards  
  – Lower barriers for new accreditors  
  – Ease institutional switching between accreditors  
• Long-term Project 2025/other conservative blueprints call for privatizing student loans, eliminating Public Service Loan Forgiveness, increasing endowment taxes, and abolishing the Department of Education.  
• Trump has pursued civil-rights cases against allegedly discriminatory schools and threatened to revoke visas of foreign nationals deemed to support terrorism, aligning with GOP platform calls.

Outlook from experts  
• Higher-ed policy analysts view Project 2025 and similar roadmaps as strong indicators of the administration’s likely next moves, though timing and exact implementation remain uncertain.
</Summary>

<Summary source="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do">
Here’s a concise, factual summary of the BBC’s February 14, 2025 article “What is Project 2025? Wish list for Trump second term, explained”:

• What it is  
  – A 900-page “policy wish list” produced by the Heritage Foundation, laying out proposals for a potential second Trump term.  
  – First unveiled April 2023; did not attract broad attention until the 2024 campaign.  
  – Heritage claims nearly two-thirds of its 2017 recommendations were adopted in Trump’s first term.

• Organization and authors  
  – Directed by Paul Dans (former Trump OPM chief of staff; since departed).  
  – Over 100 conservative groups contributed.  
  – Several authors nominated to key posts:  
     • Russell Vought (self-described Christian nationalist; confirmed to lead the Office of Management and Budget and to oversee the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer called him “the chief architect of Project 2025.”  
     • CIA Director John Ratcliffe; FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr; border czar Tom Homan; SEC nominee Paul Atkins; trade adviser Peter Navarro.

• Four stated policy aims  
  1. Restore the family as the center of American life  
  2. Dismantle the administrative (“deep”) state  
  3. Defend national sovereignty and borders  
  4. Secure individual “God-given” rights to live freely

• Key proposals  
  – Unitary executive theory: place all federal (including independent) agencies under direct presidential control.  
  – Eliminate civil-service job protections so political appointees can replace career staff.  
  – Abolish the Department of Education.  
  – Label the FBI “bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless,” overhaul or shrink it.  

• Alignment with early Trump actions  
  – Executive orders removing civil-service protections and freezing federal spending.  
  – White House “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), backed informally by Elon Musk, cutting billions in spending (legal status unclear).

• Abortion  
  – Project 2025 mentions abortion ~200 times; proposes:  
     • Withdraw mifepristone from the market and block its mailing  
     • New federal data collection on abortion  
     • HHS maintain a “biblically based” definition of marriage/family  
  – Trump publicly says he’d leave abortion laws to states and would not sign a nationwide ban.  
  – Health-secty nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr told senators Trump ordered a safety review of mifepristone.  
  – Trump issued an executive order banning federal funds for abortion—an idea detailed in Project 2025.

• Immigration and border  
  – Proposes increased funding for a US-Mexico border wall; dismantle DHS into a larger, centralized enforcement agency.  
  – Eliminate certain visa categories; raise immigrant fees; fast-track premium applications.  
  – Does not explicitly call for the mass deportations Trump campaigned on, though its “thoroughly enforce immigration laws” language overlaps.

• Energy and environment  
  – Aligns with Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill” slogan: ramp up fossil-fuel production; exit the Paris climate accord.  
  – Calls for slashing federal renewable-energy research and ending the “war on oil and natural gas.”

**High-Speed Rail Construction Accelerates in China, Multiple Projects on Track for Completion**
China's high-speed rail construction is accelerating, with at least 14 new high-speed rail projects expected to be completed this year. The total length of these projects is nearly 3,000 kilometers. The Liaoning and Guizhou provinces are expected to become the 11th and 12th provinces in the country to have high-speed rail connections between cities. The Qinling Nine Heaven Mountain Tunnel, the last tunnel on the West Sichuan high-speed rail line, was successfully completed on May 13. The line is expected to be completed in 2026. The West Sichuan high-speed rail line, which will connect Xi'an to Yan'an, is also making progress, with the southern section expected to be completed this year. The line will reduce the travel time between the two cities from 2.5 hours to around 1 hour. The Chongqing section of the Chongqing-Xi'an high-speed rail line is also progressing quickly, with a possible opening in June. This will reduce the travel time between Chongqing's main urban area and the Qianjiang district from 4 hours to under 1 hour. These projects reflect the country's high-speed rail construction's push to meet the '14th Five-Year Plan' targets. At least 14 high-speed rail lines have updated their project progress since the beginning of the year, and are working hard to meet the 2025 completion target, sparking a high-speed rail construction sprint.

**Tracking the Purge**
The Project 2025 tracker has visually demonstrated the progress of the Trump administration's initiatives, with over one-third (105 out of 301) already executed and 44 more in progress. The site breaks down progress by agency and project objectives, showing a far-right agenda to erase civil rights progress, whitewash American history, and marginalize women. Initiatives include dismantling USAID, removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization, and allowing political appointees to 'personally review and authorize appropriated funding.' The author argues that these actions are fascist and push a Christian nationalist agenda, denying racism and perpetuating the belief that white men are victims of a 'woke' agenda. The author cites research to support their claims, stating that white men hold most CEO roles, dominate Congress, and receive better medical treatment, among other privileges.

**Tracking SCRD project progress to get simpler**
The Sunshine Coast Regional District (SCRD) has developed a reporting and prioritization tool to track project progress and simplify the process of finding out what's going on with current projects. The tool is a spreadsheet that lists approved projects with resourcing details, including monetary budget and assigned staff hours. A red line indicates the limits of the organization's current capacity, with projects above the line prioritized for implementation in 2025 and those below it formally deferred for reconsideration in 2026. Chief administrative officer Tina Perreault explained that as projects above the red line are completed, capacity is anticipated to free up for projects below the line to move up. The plan is to act as a tool for both board decision-making and operational execution, and an updated version of the workplan report is slated to be in front of directors every two months. Perreault said this might not happen when 2025 Q1 reports come forward in April, but she will be pushing for it to be available when 2025 Q2 results go to elected officials in July. The tool is expected to provide something that is not too cumbersome and highlight areas where attention is needed rather than going line by line through a couple of hundred different things.' Kelly Backs, committee chair and Area D director, was 'overjoyed' to introduce the item, stating, 'It is one of the best pieces I have seen in my two and a half years on the board,' and something that will help 'organize the organization.'

**Nizhny Novgorod Aeration Station Reconstruction: 96% Complete, Contractor Faces Deadline**
The Russian Government Commission has inspected the progress of the first stage of the reconstruction of the Nizhny Novgorod aeration station (NSA). According to the press service of the regional government, the works planned within the framework of the initial stage of modernization have been completed at 96% by the end of March. The general contractor, FAU 'RosKapStroy', still needs to complete the works on electricity supply and automation of processes. It is noted that the contractor has delayed the completion of the object by a year. As a result, a road map with extended deadlines for the construction and installation works and landscaping until October 30, 2025, was signed. Governor Gleb Nikitin suggested terminating the contract with the contractor if the pace of work does not accelerate in the near future. The participants of the meeting also discussed the second stage of NSA modernization. The project of dividing the reconstruction of the object into two stages is currently undergoing state expertise. The approximate date of its completion is the second half of July 2025.

**Contractors race against time to complete nearly 1,200 kilometres of expressway**
The Ministry of Transport has urged contractors to accelerate construction on key expressway projects, warning of strict punishment for violations. With a target of completing approximately 1,188 kilometres of expressways this year, investors and contractors are making efforts to meet the deadline across multiple strategic expressway segments. The Quang Ngai - Hoai Nhon expressway has reached significant milestones, with roadbed consolidation exceeding 95%. The Deo Ca Group is pushing to finish tunnel excavation and reduce project timelines by three months for road construction and eight months for the tunnel work. Meanwhile, Le Thanh Hai, Director of the Central Construction Group, said the unit has completed half of the workload, though the work for roadbeds has been delayed due to poor weather conditions. The Ministry of Transport has directed investors and project management boards to develop comprehensive and detailed construction schedules for each contract package, enabling precise progress tracking and evaluation. Punishments, such as warnings, work volume reductions, and even contract termination, will be meted out to any contractors failing to meet deadlines. According to Deputy Director of the Transport Construction Investment Management Authority Nguyen The Minh, the 1,188 kilometres of expressways set for 2025 span 28 projects, of them 17 managed by the Ministry of Transport and the remainders by local authorities.

**Delayed Work On Gujarat Section Pushes Delhi-Mumbai Expressway Deadline To 2027**
The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway project, built at a cost of over Rs 1 lakh crore, is facing delays, pushing the completion deadline to 2027. The expressway, which is expected to provide connectivity to major economic centers in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, is currently behind schedule. While the entire stretch of the expressway is expected to be completed by October 2025, the updates indicate that the work on several sections is progressing slowly. In the 60km section between Surat and the Gujarat-Maharashtra border, the progress is less than 10 per cent, while in another section, it is less than 30 per cent. The expressway is already operational in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan, but the sections in Maharashtra are not expected to be ready before the end of 2026. The ministry of road transport and highways had said in July 2024 that work on 26 packages had been completed with a collective physical progress of 82 per cent. 'The section in Rajasthan is expected to be ready in the next 10-12 months,' officials told News18. 'Parts of the expressway in Maharashtra are, however, not expected to be ready before the end of 2026,' the officials added.

**New tracker show how much of Project 2025 has been implemented**
A new tracking site, created by Redditors, has revealed that President Donald Trump's administration has implemented over 36% of Project 2025, a 900-plus-page document outlining conservative goals to shrink federal bureaucracy and implement conservative ideology. The tracker, which monitors 297 objectives recommended by the Heritage Foundation, has found that Trump has achieved 88% of the objectives put before the Executive Office of the President. The tracker also highlights the administration's efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Education, and has deemed the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) fully finished by Project 2025. As one of the tracker's creators, rusticgorilla, explained, 'Today, his administration is stuffed full of Project 2025 contributors, and his executive orders are ripped straight from the playbook's pages.'

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Grist article (April 30, 2025)**: Environmental news site reporting that roughly one-third of Project 2025's 300+ objectives have been fully implemented after four months of the administration, with 60+ more "in progress." The article focuses on environmental and climate policy rollbacks. It appears factual in its implementation statistics, though has an environmental focus.

2. **AFSCME blog (April 16, 2025)**: Union publication stating that one-third of the Project 2025 agenda was in motion within 90 days. It details specific implementations affecting labor, education, and public services. As a labor union opposed to Project 2025, it has a clear perspective but provides concrete examples with specific page citations.

3. **Red Wine and Blue article (no clear date)**: Progressive site documenting implementation of Project 2025 objectives related to reproductive rights, education, and student aid. The extraction is incomplete but provides specific policy changes with government sources. Clear progressive perspective but contains factual reporting.

4. **Brookings article (May 14, 2025)**: Reputable nonpartisan think tank describing their Regulatory Tracker monitoring Trump administration changes. It doesn't provide specific Project 2025 implementation numbers but offers a methodical tracking approach from a credible institution.

5. **Fast Company article (Feb. 28, 2025)**: Business magazine reporting on the actual Project 2025 Tracker website. Provides critical factual information: 36% of Project 2025's objectives were marked "completed" as of Feb 28. Details tracker methodology by creator Adrienne Cobb, who manually extracted explicit objectives from the 922-page document.

6. **Tax Foundation article (May 13, 2025)**: Tax policy think tank focusing on tax-related aspects of the administration. Limited direct relevance to counting completed Project 2025 objectives, though confirms implementation of certain fiscal policies.

7. **Perplexity report**: AI-generated research suggesting 32-36% of objectives implemented or in progress as of May 2025. Attempts to provide specific numbers but contains incomplete information and should be treated with appropriate caution.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

1. **Implementation rate of Project 2025 objectives (Jan-May 2025)**: Most directly relevant reference class. We have data points showing 36% completion by February 28 (Fast Company) and "roughly one-third" by April 30 (Grist).

2. **Implementation rate of first-term Trump administration policy priorities**: Less directly applicable but provides context for executive action implementation pace. The sources suggest the second-term pace may be faster due to pre-planning and strategic personnel placement.

The first reference class is clearly most suitable as it directly tracks the specific metric we're forecasting.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- Today is May 16, 2025
- Target date is July 1, 2025 (46 days from now)
- Administration timeline:
  - By February 28 (59 days into term): 36% objectives completed
  - By April 30 (120 days into term): "roughly one-third" fully implemented, 60+ more "in progress"

This suggests the implementation rate was approximately 0.6% per day in the first two months, then slowed somewhat between February and April. This pattern is consistent with tackling "easier" objectives first, followed by more complex implementations.

## (d) Justification

The most reliable information comes from the Fast Company article, which states the Project 2025 Tracker showed 36% of objectives completed as of February 28, 2025. Assuming a total of approximately 300-350 objectives (based on Grist's "300+" figure), this would mean 108-126 objectives were already completed by the end of February.

The Grist article from April 30 mentions "roughly one-third" were completed, which appears to be a slight decrease or simply a more generalized figure. This discrepancy creates some uncertainty.

However, both sources indicate a substantial number of objectives (at least 100) completed by late April, with 60+ more "in progress." Given the administration's demonstrated commitment to implementing Project 2025 objectives and 46 days remaining until July 1, the conversion of some "in progress" objectives to "Done" status seems highly likely.

Even with a slowing implementation pace, the administration would need to complete only about 20 more objectives (assuming 100 are already done) in 46 days to reach 120. Given that the initial pace was over 100 objectives in four months, this target appears achievable even with significant deceleration.

# Outside view calibration:

Based on the most reliable data point (36% completion by February 28), and assuming a total of roughly 300-330 objectives, approximately 108-119 objectives were already marked "Done" by the end of February. Even if implementation has slowed since then and the "roughly one-third" from April represents no significant increase, the administration would need to complete only a few more objectives to reach 120 by July 1.

Given:
- The administration completed ~108-119 objectives in the first two months
- 60+ objectives were "in progress" as of late April
- An additional 46 days remain until the resolution date
- The administration appears committed to implementing Project 2025

The target of 120 "Done" objectives by July 1 seems highly likely to be achieved. Even with significant deceleration in implementation pace, the proximity to the target makes it probable.

# Outside View Prediction:
92% probability that at least 120 objectives will be classified as "Done" by July 1, 2025.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Grist article (April 30, 2025)**:
   - Environmental news outlet reporting on Project 2025 implementation
   - Key facts: Crowdsourced tracker shows roughly one-third of Project 2025 objectives have been fully implemented in under four months, with 60+ more "in progress"
   - Generally factual reporting with environmental focus; specific numbers likely verifiable

2. **AFSCME article (April 16, 2025)**:
   - Labor union perspective opposing Project 2025
   - Claims one-third of agenda implemented within 90 days
   - Contains specific implementation examples that appear factual, though framed through labor advocacy lens

3. **Red Wine and Blue article (no clear date)**:
   - Progressive advocacy site documentation of Project 2025 implementations
   - Focuses on reproductive rights, education, and DEI policy changes
   - Progressive perspective but provides specific policy examples

4. **Brookings article (May 14, 2025)**:
   - Nonpartisan think tank analysis
   - Describes their regulatory tracker but lacks specific Project 2025 implementation numbers
   - High-quality source but limited direct relevance to our question

5. **Fast Company article (Feb. 28, 2025)**:
   - Business magazine reporting on the Project 2025 Tracker website itself
   - States 36% of objectives marked "completed" by late February
   - Details tracker methodology: Adrienne Cobb manually reads the document, extracts objectives, tracks implementations
   - Reports ~50,000-100,000 daily visitors to the tracker

6. **Tax Foundation article (May 13, 2025)**:
   - Focused narrowly on tax policy implementation
   - Limited relevance to overall objective count

7. **Perplexity report**:
   - Synthesizes information about the Project 2025 Tracker
   - Reports 32-36% of objectives implemented as of May 2025
   - Provides timeline: 18% completed (January), 32% completed (February)

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

For this question, I need to establish:
1. The total number of Project 2025 objectives
2. Current implementation rate
3. Historical patterns of policy implementation

Possible reference classes:
1. **Current implementation pace of Project 2025** - Most relevant as we have multiple data points showing progression
2. **Prior presidential administration implementation rates** - Less applicable as we lack comparable systematic tracking
3. **Standard government policy implementation timelines** - Too general

The most suitable reference class is the current implementation pace of Project 2025 itself. From our sources:
- Project 2025 contains 300+ objectives total
- 120 objectives would represent approximately 40% of the total
- Current completion rate (late April) is "roughly one-third" or approximately 100 objectives
- Implementation began rapidly but has slowed significantly

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- Current date: May 16, 2025
- Target date: July 1, 2025
- Time remaining: 46 days

Implementation timeline from sources:
- January 2025: ~18% completed (~54 objectives assuming 300 total)
- February 2025: ~32-36% completed (~96-108 objectives)
- April 2025: ~33% completed (~100 objectives)

This reveals a significant pattern:
- Month 1: ~54 objectives implemented
- Month 2: ~42-54 additional objectives
- Months 3-4: Only ~0-4 additional objectives

The implementation rate has clearly decelerated significantly after the initial burst of activity.

## (d) Justification

Based on this analysis, I can make the following observations:

1. As of late April 2025, approximately 100 objectives (one-third of 300+) were marked as "Done"
2. There are 60+ objectives currently marked as "in progress"
3. The rate of implementation has dramatically slowed after the first two months
4. To reach 120 objectives by July 1, approximately 20 more objectives would need to be completed

The initial rapid implementation likely represents "low-hanging fruit" - objectives that could be accomplished quickly through executive orders or immediate agency directives. The current pool of "in progress" objectives likely requires more complex processes, interagency coordination, or may face legal challenges.

The significant slowdown in implementation rate suggests many remaining objectives face structural barriers. However, the substantial pool of 60+ "in progress" objectives means there's a ready pipeline of potential completions within the 46-day timeframe.

## Outside view calibration:

Starting with key facts:
- Current completion: ~100 objectives (33%)
- Target: 120 objectives (40%)
- Gap: 20 objectives needed in 46 days
- In-progress pool: 60+ objectives
- Recent implementation rate: Near-zero in months 3-4

If the recent trend of minimal completions continued, the probability would be very low. However, the large pool of in-progress objectives suggests some completions are imminent. Even at a significantly reduced pace compared to the first two months (e.g., 10-15 per month rather than 40-50), the administration could potentially reach 120 objectives.

The key uncertainty is whether the recent dramatic slowdown represents a temporary lull or a more permanent state. Given the significant pool of in-progress objectives and the administration's demonstrated commitment to implementing Project 2025, I assess there's approximately a 60% chance of reaching 120 completed objectives by July 1, 2025.

## Outside View Prediction:
60%

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
  • Grist (April 30): credible environmental outlet. Reports that in “under four months” the administration has fully implemented roughly one-third of the ~300 Project 2025 objectives (~100 done) and has 60+ “in progress.” Factual count data; opinion (e.g., “way beyond my wildest dreams”) clearly attributed.  
  • AFSCME (April 16): union perspective, strongly worded but with concrete examples of executive orders (e.g., reinstating Schedule F, firing civil servants). Gives qualitative evidence of one-third of agenda “in motion.” Higher risk of spin, but counts roughly align with Grist.  
  • Red Wine & Blue (progressive site): opinion-oriented, incomplete. Documents early actions on abortion, education, labor. Lacks clear counts of “Done” objectives; lower reliability for forecasting counts.  
  • Brookings (May 14): top‐tier think tank. Tracks regulatory changes across agencies; not a direct count of Project 2025 objectives but gives sense of pace for rule rollbacks. Suggests agencies can move dozens of major rules in a few months, supporting feasibility of continued pace.  
  • Fast Company (Feb 28): reliable business magazine. Cites tracker data as of Feb 28: 36% of objectives completed (~108) in ~39 days. Methodology transparent (manual citation of news events).  
  • Perplexity report: AI compilation; mixes fact and error. States ~32–36% of objectives “implemented or in progress” as of May 2025. Use sparingly for broad triangulation, not precise counts.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
  • “Executive‐order heavy” trackers (e.g., deregulatory trackers in first Trump term): initial surge of easily reversible rules, then tapering as remaining items require complex rulemaking, litigation, or legislation.  
  • “Blueprint implementation” pace: initial low-hanging fruit (Day 1 EOs) then diminishing returns. In first 39 days ~36% done; next ~60 days likely slower due to legal pushback and multi‐phase initiatives.  
  • Best analog: Brookings Reg Tracker in Trump 1, which logged dozens of major deregulatory actions in first 100 days, then slowed in subsequent months.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
  • Today is May 16, 2025; outcome date July 1, 2025 → 46 days to go.  
  • Historical pace:  
    – Jan 20–Feb 28 (39 days): ~36% done → ~108 objectives.  
    – Feb 28–Apr 30 (62 days): Grist still reports “one-third” done (~100), suggesting slowdown or data‐update lag.  
  • To hit 120 done by July 1: need ~12–20 additional “Done” tags over 46 days → ~0.3–0.4 tags/day. Even a heavily tapered pace (~50% of initial) would suffice.  

4. Additional factors  
  • Status quo momentum strong: many remaining objectives tied to straightforward executive orders or regulatory actions.  
  • Legal headwinds intensify: dozens of lawsuits, potential injunctions slow some items.  
  • Congressional bottlenecks: items requiring new statutes or reconciliation may not clear in time.  
  • Tracker maintainers are highly motivated; they may count partial or loosely defined actions as “Done,” biasing counts upward.  

Justification for outside view:  
  • Baseline (out-view) based on historical data: ~108 objectives done by late February, ~100 by late April (data noise notwithstanding). To reach 120 by July 1 implies moving from ~33–36% to 40% done in ~1.5 months.  
  • Even under a moderate slowdown (50% of initial pace), adding ~0.45% per day yields ~21% absolute in 46 days, more than needed.  
  • However, legal challenges and harder items ahead may cut pace further; a 75% pace yields ~16.5% in 46 days, still enough to clear 40%.  
  • Balancing strong initial momentum, administrative focus, and anticipated slowdown, the odds remain strongly in favor of clearing 120 by July 1 but not certain.  

Outside view calibration:  
  • True‐probability estimate focused on actual track record and pace deceleration, not on overconfidence.  
  • Tether to known figures: ~108–100 done as of late spring, need ~120 by July 1.  
  • Small shifts matter: 80% corresponds to 4:1 odds, 90% to 9:1. I judge a somewhat conservative tilt below 90% to allow for litigation/legislative drag.  

Outside View Prediction:
I assign a 85% probability that the Project 2025 Tracker will classify at least 120 objectives as “Done” on July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  

  a. Grist (April 30, 2025)  
     • Summary: Reports that in under four months, “roughly one-third” of Project 2025’s ~300+ objectives are fully implemented (“Done”) and another 60+ are “In Progress.” Highlights rapid executive‐branch action on DEI, Education, science grants, climate rollbacks, and major EOs.  
     • Quality: Grist is a reputable environmental news outlet. Factual claims about counts and specific directives (e.g., scrubbing DEI language) are verifiable against public executive orders. Opinions (e.g., quotes that the pace is “beyond my wildest dreams”) are clearly attributed.  
     • Facts to anchor: ~100 “Done” by late April; ~60 in progress.  

  b. AFSCME blog (April 16, 2025)  
     • Summary: Focus on labor and public‐service objectives; one-third of the agenda “in motion” within 90 days, including Schedule F reinstatement, Head Start freezes, NLRB firings, CFPB closings.  
     • Quality: AFSCME is a stakeholder with a clear political slant. Factual items (EOs, funding freezes, firings) can be cross‐checked; interpretive framing (e.g., “harm working families”) is advocacy.  
     • Use for count: Confirms ~100 objectives executed, but less precise on total.  

  c. Fast Company (Feb 28, 2025)  
     • Summary: Tracker launched ~Feb 2025, showing 36% of objectives marked “completed.” Total objectives unspecified but implied ~300.  
     • Quality: Business technology outlet; interviews with tracker creators are first-hand. Percent‐complete metric is credible.  
     • Anchor: 36% complete = approximately 108 of ~300 objectives by late Feb.  

  d. Red Wine & Blue (partial extract)  
     • Summary: Details on policy areas (Christian nationalism, education cuts, student aid), with specific dollar figures and program impacts. No aggregate completion rate.  
     • Quality: Progressive opinion outlet with strong framing. Cited figures on Title X funding and Head Start cuts appear factual and sourced, but no overall “Done” count.  
     • Limited use: Illustrative of the types of objectives but not for aggregate count.  

  e. Brookings Reg Tracker (May 14, 2025)  
     • Summary: Explains a regulatory‐action tracker covering significant rule‐makings, roll-backs, and court battles, but does not quantify Project 2025 objectives.  
     • Quality: High – Brookings is a leading think tank. However, this tracker is parallel and not directly counting Project 2025 objectives.  
     • Limited direct use: offers methodological context but not raw numbers.  

  f. Perplexity_report (undated, internal)  
     • Summary: Claims Jan end: 18% of objectives done; Feb end: 32%; but cuts off mid-February. Likely derived from incomplete web scraps.  
     • Quality: Automated content aggregation; significant risk of error. Should be treated skeptically but gives an early pace indicator.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
   • Possible reference classes:  
     1. Implementation trackers of past presidential policy blueprints (e.g., Trump 1.0’s “Contract With America” EOs). Data scarce for direct counts.  
     2. The Project 2025 Tracker itself – extrapolate its past pace.  
     3. Brookings Reg Tracker pace of regulatory roll-backs. Reg Tracker lists ~150 significant actions in ~4 months, but Project 2025 objectives are a broader set.  

   • Suitability: Only the tracker’s own history offers a robust quantitative reference class. We observe:  
     – Jan 2025 (~30 days in): ~18% done (~54 objectives)  
     – Feb 2025 (~60 days in): ~32% done (~96)  
     – Late Feb 2025: 36% done (~108)  
     – Late April 2025 (~110 days in): ~33%–36% (~100–110)  

   • Chosen class: Project 2025 Tracker’s cumulative “Done” counts over time.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Horizon: Today is May 16; outcome known by July 1. Time remaining ≈46 days (~1.5 months).  
   • Historical pacing:  
     – First month: gain from 0% to ~18% → ~54 objectives → ~1.8/week  
     – Second month: gain to ~32% → ~96 objectives → ~42 more in ~30 days → ~1.4/week  
     – March–April: pace slowed/stalled (36% → ~33–36%) maybe legal pushback.  
   • Implied short‐term trend: early blitz of easy EOs, then slowdown as legal challenges mount and harder legislative objectives remain.  

4. Justification for outside-view prediction  
   • Current baseline: ~100–110 objectives “Done” as of late April/early May.  
   • Needed to hit 120 by July 1: additional ~10–20 objectives in 46 days → ~0.25–0.5 objectives per day (2–3 per week).  
   • Capacity: Administration can still issue EOs rapidly and finalize some rulings. But many remaining objectives require either congressional action (slower) or risk being tied up in courts.  
   • Legal/political friction: Several major EOs (e.g., “endangerment finding” reconsideration, DEI rollbacks) already in litigation, likely slowing “Done” classifications.  
   • Historical slowdown: pace peaked early (1.8/week) then dropped (~1.4/week) then plateaued. Forecasted pace of 2–3/week is above recent rate (~1–1.5/week), unless the administration prioritizes a fresh implementation push.  

Outside-view calibration:

  • Anchor: If the early-term blitz had continued, 1.5 months × 1.5 objectives/week ≈ 9 more → total ~110–120.  
  • Upside: surge of last-minute actions could add 15–20 → total ~115–130.  
  • Downside: legal blockades and diminishing easy targets could cap new completions at ~8–12 → total ~108–122.  
  • Balance of evidence: marginally more likely than not that the tracker will tip just over the 120 threshold, but not overwhelmingly so.  
  • Outside-view probability: 60%.  

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 60% chance that the Project 2025 Tracker will classify at least 120 objectives as “Done” on July 1, 2025.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Facebook post (indeterminate date)**: Introduces the Project 2025 Tracker website that catalogs objectives from the 900-page plan and marks completed ones as "Done." Limited implementation data but confirms tracker's existence. Quality: Informational but minimal substantive data.

2. **Heatmap article (February 17, 2025)**: Reports 32% of ~300 measurable Project 2025 objectives were "implemented or in progress" 25 days into administration. Provides department-specific completion rates (USAID: ~92%, Energy/EPA/Interior: ~40% each). Quality: Specific early baseline data; identifies tracker creator Adrienne Cobb who extracted measurable objectives.

3. **Grist article (April 30, 2025)**: Reports "roughly one-third" of objectives (~100+ items) marked "done" with another 60+ "in progress" after fewer than four months. Quality: Recent (2 weeks ago) with specific implementation numbers. Expert quotes: Paul Dans (former Project 2025 director) says implementation is "way beyond my wildest dreams."

4. **Inside Higher Ed article (April 15, 2025)**: Reports one-third of ~50 higher-education recommendations implemented in first 85 days; cites WSJ finding that over half of Trump's executive orders align with Heritage recommendations. Quality: Sector-specific but provides broader context.

5. **BBC article (February 14, 2025)**: Background on Project 2025 and key personnel; mentions early implementation actions. Quality: Contextual rather than statistical.

6. **Medium.com article (April 16, 2025)**: Reports 105 of 301 objectives (35%) already executed and 44 more in progress. Quality: Recent with specific numbers, though potential political bias exists.

7. **The Daily Dot article (February 25, 2025)**: Reports over 36% of Project 2025 implemented; states tracker monitors 297 objectives with 88% of Executive Office objectives achieved. Quality: Data from February but provides specific percentages.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple independent sources (Heatmap, Grist, Medium, Daily Dot) consistently report 32-36% of objectives already completed by April/May 2025, representing ~100-107 completed objectives out of ~300 total.
- Key Project 2025 architects hold influential positions implementing the agenda (Vought at OMB identified as a "chief architect").
- The administration has demonstrated consistent implementation momentum from January through April.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Tracker creator Adrienne Cobb's methodology appears robust, extracting ~300 measurable objectives from the 920-page document.
- 60+ objectives reported as "in progress" as of April 30 (Grist), representing a pipeline of near-term completions.
- Early implementation targeted "low-hanging fruit" via executive action (Cobb's analysis), suggesting a strategic approach.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Potential legal challenges may slow future implementation (mentioned in Grist article).
- Speculation about shifting administration priorities in coming months.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- Today: May 16, 2025
- Resolution date: July 1, 2025
- Timeframe: 46 days remaining

If the timeframe were halved (23 days), my prediction would decrease moderately as there would be less time to convert "in progress" items to "done" status. The administration would need to maintain its current pace to reach the threshold.

If doubled (92 days), my prediction would increase substantially, as the administration would have ample time to convert the 60+ "in progress" objectives and initiate new implementations, making 120 completions nearly certain.

## (d) Justification

Based on the most recent reliable data, approximately 100-107 objectives have already been completed as of April/early May 2025. With 46 days remaining until July 1st, only 13-20 additional objectives need to be completed to reach the 120 threshold.

Given that 60+ objectives were reported as "in progress" as of April 30, even a conservative conversion rate of these items to "done" status would likely push the total over 120. The administration has demonstrated the capability to implement 100+ objectives in the first 90-120 days of the term. With key Project 2025 authors in influential positions (Vought at OMB described as "chief architect"), the institutional mechanisms are firmly in place to continue implementation.

Potential obstacles include legal challenges and implementation difficulty as "easier" objectives are completed. However, the closeness to the target (needing only 13-20 more completions) makes these obstacles unlikely to prevent reaching 120 objectives.

# Probability calibration

My outside view analysis indicated a 92% probability of reaching 120 completed objectives. My inside view analysis strongly supports this conclusion based on:

1. Current completion pace (100-107 objectives already completed)
2. Significant pipeline of "in progress" items (60+)
3. Demonstrated implementation capability (100+ objectives in first 90-120 days)
4. Strategic positioning of Project 2025 architects in key roles

Even accounting for potential slowdowns or legal challenges, the current trajectory strongly indicates the 120 threshold will be reached given how close the administration already is to this target. I maintain the 92% probability as well-calibrated.

# Checklist:
1. Will Project 2025 Tracker classify ≥120 objectives as "Done" on July 1, 2025? My analysis focuses precisely on this tracker's classification.
2. Outside view base rate: 92% probability based on implementation pace and completion status.
3. 92 out of 100 times, the Project 2025 Tracker will classify at least 120 objectives as "Done" by July 1, 2025.
4. Key evidence: Multiple sources confirm 100-107 objectives already completed; 60+ objectives "in progress"; consistently sustained implementation pace; Project 2025 authors in key positions.
5. Blind-spot: Court injunctions blocking implementation of multiple objectives currently counted as "done."
6. Status quo trajectory clearly points toward exceeding 120 completed objectives by July 1.

Probability: 92%
Predicted Probability: 92.0%

- Reports over 36% of Project 2025 implemented (~108 objectives)
- Cites tracker creator "rusticgorilla" (Adrienne Cobb)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Consistent completion reporting across sources**: Multiple independent sources (Grist, Medium, Daily Dot) report 32-36% completion (100-108 objectives) between February and April 2025.
- **Department-specific implementation data**: Detailed breakdown showing varying completion rates by department (USAID at ~92%, Energy at ~40%, EPA at ~40%).
- **Established methodology**: Tracker creator Adrienne Cobb identified ~300 measurable objectives from the 920-page blueprint, providing a consistent measurement framework.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Implementation pace pattern**: Initial rapid implementation of ~100 objectives in first 100 days, suggesting capability to complete at least 20 more by July.
- **Expert assessments**: Former Project 2025 director told Politico implementation was "beyond wildest dreams," indicating strong commitment.
- **Executive action focus**: Multiple sources note administration prioritizing executive actions that don't require Congress, enhancing implementation ability.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Legal challenges**: Multiple sources mention lawsuits, but insufficient data on how significantly this will slow implementation.
- **Potential classification inconsistencies**: Some ambiguity in how objectives are classified as "done" vs. "in progress."

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- **Current date**: May 16, 2025
- **Target date**: July 1, 2025
- **Remaining time**: 46 days

If the timeframe were halved (23 days), probability would drop significantly (to ~70%) as there would be less time to implement additional objectives from the current ~105 to reach 120.

If the timeframe were doubled (92 days), probability would increase to ~95%, as the additional time would almost certainly allow enough implementations to reach 120 threshold given demonstrated pace.

## (d) Justification

The outside view base rate of 85% is justified by:

1. **Current completion status**: Approximately 105 out of 301 objectives (34.9%) were "done" by mid-April 2025.

2. **Required progress**: Need ~15 more objectives completed in remaining ~75 days (from mid-April to July 1).

3. **Historical pace analysis**:
   - Initial pace: ~108 objectives in first ~39 days (~2.8 objectives/day)
   - Even at 10% of initial pace (0.28 objectives/day), would complete 21 more by July 1
   - Even at 5% of initial pace (0.14 objectives/day), would complete 10 more by July 1

4. **Structural advantages for continued progress**:
   - Focus on executive actions that bypass congressional approval
   - Strategic prioritization of "low-hanging fruit" (per tracker creator)
   - Strong administration commitment to agenda implementation

5. **Potential headwinds**:
   - Legal challenges to some implementations
   - Increasing difficulty of remaining objectives
   - Public opposition to controversial measures

Given the strong early implementation evidence and the small additional number needed to reach 120, the outside view probability of 85% appears well-calibrated, with a slight adjustment upward to 88% warranted by the consistent implementation evidence.

## Probability calibration

I've carefully evaluated the supporting evidence and the projected trajectory. While the initial pace suggested completion of ~2.8 objectives per day, I recognize this will naturally decelerate. However, even a 95% deceleration would yield completion of ~14 more objectives by July 1, bringing the total to ~119.

The strongest factor supporting reaching 120 objectives is the small gap between current status (~105) and target (120), requiring completion of only ~5% of total objectives in the remaining 46 days.

The most significant risk factors are legal challenges and the increasing difficulty of remaining objectives. However, given the administration's demonstrated commitment and strategic approach, these factors are unlikely to prevent reaching the 120 threshold.

A 88% probability corresponds to 7.3:1 odds in favor of reaching 120 objectives, which aligns with the evidence of strong progress to date and the relatively small additional progress needed.

## Checklist:
1. Resolution: Will Project 2025 Tracker show ≥120 objectives marked "Done" when Metaculus checks on/after July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view: 85% probability based on implementation pace and time remaining
3. Consistency: 88/100 times, tracker would show ≥120 objectives as "Done" by July 1 given current pace
4. Key evidence: 105 objectives already "done" by mid-April; only ~15 more needed in 75 days; strong executive implementation focus
5. Blind spot: Court ruling halts/reverses multiple implementations, reducing "Done" count
6. Status quo: Continued implementation progress is the status quo trajectory

Probability: 88%
Predicted Probability: 88.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will the Project 2025 Tracker show at least 120 objectives marked Done when accessed on or after July 1, 2025? (Today is May 16, 2025, so there are 46 days until resolution.)

2. Source analysis  
a. Grist (April 30, 2025): Reliable environmental outlet; reports ~100 objectives Done (~33% of ~300) and 60+ in progress after ≈4 months. Strong detail, low ideological slant on counts.  
b. Heatmap.news (Feb 17, 2025): Data‐driven politics site; by Day 25, Tracker showed 32% implemented/in progress. Corroborates Grist numbers.  
c. Facebook group post (date unspecified): Low reliability; announces Tracker launch and invites activism but no new counts.  
d. Fast Company (Feb 28, 2025): Business magazine; reports tracker methodology and 36% Done by late Feb. Reliable on visitor traffic, confirms completion rate.  
e. Governing for Impact/Center for Progressive Reform (via Grist): Finds only ~20% of climate/environment measures done; narrower scope, but confirms environment rollbacks slower.  
f. The Conversation (May 14, 2025): Profiles Russ Vought; explains institutional drivers (OMB, DOGE) but no counts. Reliable context on power structure.  
g. Inside Higher Ed (Apr 15, 2025): Finds ~1/3 of higher‐ed objectives done in first 85 days. Matches overall pace.  

3. Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong evidence:  
- Multiple independent sources (Grist, Heatmap, Fast Company, Inside Higher Ed) converge on ~100 Done by late April → ~33%.  
- Clear causal mechanism: early “low-hanging fruit” implemented rapidly; remaining objectives harder/legal.  

Moderate evidence:  
- 60+ objectives “in progress” suggests a pipeline that could finish in next 46 days if pace stays moderate.  
- Institutional impetus (Vought/OMB, DOGE) remains high, pushing for swift completion.  

Weak evidence:  
- Anecdotal activism metrics do not directly affect completion pace.  
- Speculative legal challenges could block progress but magnitude uncertain.  

4. Reference‐class & out-of-sample considerations  
Reference class is the Project 2025 implementation pace itself. Initial rate:  
  • Jan (≈30 days): +18% (~54 objectives)  
  • Feb (≈28 days): +14–18% (~42–54 more)  
  • Mar–Apr (≈60 days): +0–1% (~0–3 more)  
Deceleration is stark. July 1 is 46 days out—less than Jan or Feb. But “in progress” pool is large.  

5. Timeframe sensitivity  
- If timeframe halved (~23 days): must finish ~20 objectives → ≈0.9/day. Unlikely given recent slowdown. Probability would drop by ~20–30 points.  
- If timeframe doubled (~92 days): same 20 objectives in 92 days → ≈0.2/day. Very plausible. Probability would rise by ~10–15 points.  

6. Justification & inside view adjustment  
Base rate (out-of-sample) suggests slim chance to jump from 33% to 40% in 46 days given slowdown (perhaps ≈30%). But:  
  • Pipeline of 60+ in-progress objectives (moderate evidence) could complete quickly if the administration prioritizes them.  
  • Strong institutional mandate and minimal legislative resistance (much via executive action) support acceleration.  
  • Recent slowdown could reverse if the White House orders a final push for early wins ahead of an anticipated political backlash.  

Balancing these: the pipeline and institutional push moderately offset the deceleration trend. This yields an inside‐view probability above base—roughly 55%.

Probability calibration  
Given strong convergence on current counts, clear deceleration pattern, but also a sizable in-progress backlog and high executive drive, I assign 55% to reaching ≥120 Done by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: ✔ “≥120 Done by July 1 out of ~300 objectives, 46 days away.”  
2. Base rate: ✔ ~33% as of late April; raised to 55% by inside‐view.  
3. Consistency: ✔ “55 out of 100 times tracker hits 120+ Done by July 1.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   - ~100 Done as of late April (strong)  
   - 60+ in progress (moderate)  
   - Sharp slowdown after Feb (strong)  
   - Executive action remains unblocked (moderate)  
5. Blind spot: Legal setbacks or resource constraints abruptly stall in-progress objectives.  
6. Status quo: Without renewed push, likely stays near 100–105; modest push needed to hit 120.

Probability: 55%
Predicted Probability: 55.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question and resolution criteria  
   “By July 1, 2025 (46 days from today), will the crowdsourced Project 2025 Tracker show at least 120 of its ~300 objectives marked as ‘Done’?”

2. Source analysis  
   • Grist (Apr 30): Reputable environmental outlet. Reports ≈100 “Done” and 60 “In Progress” after ~100 days. Factual.  
   • Heatmap.News (Feb 17): Tracker author pulled ~300 objectives; 32% done by mid-Feb (~96). Reliable tech‐policy reporting.  
   • The Daily Dot/Fast Company (Feb 25/28): Tracker shows ~36% complete (~108) in late Feb. Credible first‐hand interviews.  
   • AFSCME blog (Apr 16): Labor‐union perspective; confirms ≈100 implemented early via executive actions. Advocacy‐slanted but factual on EOs.  
   • Perplexity scrape (undated): Automated, less reliable. Gives early‐term pace (18% end-Jan, 32% mid-Feb).  
   • Brookings Reg Tracker (May 14): High‐quality but tracks broader regulatory rollbacks, not specific objectives. Contextual.  

3. Evidence analysis (weighting relevant factors)  
   Strong evidence:  
     – Multiple trackers (Grist, Heatmap, Fast Company) agree: ≈100–110 objectives done by late April/early May.  
     – Direct count from the Project 2025 Tracker as primary data.  
   Moderate evidence:  
     – Early‐term pace: 1.5–2 objectives/week; slowed from ~1.8 to ~1.4 per week over time.  
     – Legal challenges (courts reinstating funds, injunctions) create drag on further “Done” classifications.  
   Weak evidence:  
     – Potential “blitz” of last‐minute EOs; possible but unquantified.  
     – Insider influence (Vought/OMB) could accelerate rulemaking, but marginalized by courts.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
   • Horizon: 46 days (~6.5 weeks) from May 16 to July 1.  
   • If horizon halved (23 days): only ~3–5 additional objectives likely → very unlikely to reach 120.  
   • If horizon doubled (92 days): likely ~13–20 additions → high probability to surpass 120.  

5. Justification and inside‐view adjustment  
   Outside view base rate: 60% (admin likely to hit 120 based on past pace).  
   Inside‐view shifts:  
     – Remaining objectives are harder (require legislation or drawn‐out rulemakings). Courts have blocked a number of early rollbacks.  
     – Pace has decelerated from 1.8/w to ~1.0–1.4/w. At best‐recent pace (1.4/w × 6.5 wks ≈ 9), tracker reaches ~110–120.  
     – Potential late push of quick EOs (e.g., small agency reorganizations) could add 5–10 more, but uncertainty is high.  
   Net adjustment: slow‐down and legal frictions reduce probability from 60% to ≈45%.  

6. Other considerations  
   • Blind‐spot: A surprise surge in agency reorganization orders (e.g., Schedule F reinstatement, mass regulatory rollbacks) could add >10 “Done” items rapidly, pushing probability back upward.  
   • Status quo: No sudden change suggests current slow pace will continue.  

Probability calibration  
Given the strong base‐rate support and credible slow‐down factors, a middle‐of‐the‐road estimate (~45%) reflects moderate uncertainty but leans toward the “No” side.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: ✓ question, resolution, timeframe clear.  
2. Base rate: 60% from tracker trend.  
3. Consistency: “45 out of 100 times, the tracker hits ≥120 objectives by July 1.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   - ≈100–110 objectives done as of early May (strong)  
   - Pace slowed to ~1–1.4/week (moderate)  
   - Legal injunctions blocking rollbacks (moderate)  
   - Potential last‐minute EO burst (weak)  
5. Blind‐spot: Major sudden regulatory blitz adding >10 objectives.  
6. Status quo: Continuation of current slow pace likely.

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Heatmap (17 Feb 25): reputable U.S. climate-politics site; quotes tracker author; earliest hard number (“32 % implemented or in progress”). Factual portion solid; ∼3-month old.  
• Daily Dot (25 Feb 25): mid-tier tech/culture outlet; cites tracker screen grabs; shows 36 % “implemented” (≃90-95 Done). Useful but not primary.  
• Medium post by C.G. Wipper (16 Apr 25): opinionated but relays tracker count “105 of 301 Done”. Factual part verifiable; four weeks old.  
• Grist (30 Apr 25): respected non-profit newsroom; quotes tracker (“roughly one-third ≈100+ Done, 60+ In-Progress”). Good quality, 2½ weeks old.  
• Inside Higher Ed, BBC, The Conversation – background on Project 2025, not on numeric tracker status.  
• AskNews dump – largely unrelated infrastructure stories; only item relevant is “Tracking the Purge” (Medium) which duplicates the 105 figure.  
Overall, we have two independent, recent (mid-Apr) sources giving ≈105 “Done” and consistent earlier counts (≈90-95 late Feb). No May numbers yet.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong  
• Consistency of two independent outlets (Grist, Medium) giving ~100-105 Done by late April.  
Moderate  
• Early pace: +10-15 objectives moved to “Done” between late Feb and mid-Apr (≈0.3/day); suggests momentum but already slowing.  
• Structural ease: many remaining items need only EO or agency memo (still executable inside 6 weeks).  
• Tracker is activist-maintained and updated quickly (author publicly solicits crowdsourcing).  
Weak  
• Potential reversals from court rulings could move items back to “In progress”; frequency unknown.  
• Unknown May count; sample error ±5-7.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days left to resolution: 46 (16 May → 1 Jul).  
Halved (23 d): probability would drop ~10 pts (less time to add 10-15 items).  
Doubled (92 d): would rise ~15-20 pts as far more time to accumulate >120.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside view baseline: Using logistic-type adoption, an aggressive first-six-months White-House blueprint usually hits ~35-40 % of tractable objectives (historical Heritage claim: 2/3 in four years ⇒ ≈40 % in first half-year). Baseline chance of ≥120/300 (~40 %) by 1 Jul therefore ~50 %.  
Inside view adjustments:  
+ Momentum: 105 already achieved, need only +15 (≈14 % of remaining 195) in 46 days → plausible (+5 pts).  
+ Many leftover “easy” agency memos still listed by tracker author (+3 pts).  
– Deceleration evident (15 gains in ~50 days) and “low-hanging fruit” largely taken (–6 pts).  
– Legal/appropriations push-back could downgrade some Done (–4 pts).  
Net shift: +5 – 10 + ? ≈ +8 pts → 58 % final.

(c) Yes-path factors (need any ~15 of…): new DOE office closures, additional DEI revocations, mifepristone mail halt, more visa crack-downs, CFPB defunding memo.  
No-path factors: courts vacate prior EOs, tracker re-classifies, author falls behind, or Trump pivoting to Cong. battles slows EO output.

Probability calibration
Mean current Done assumed 110 ± 5 (sd). Expected increment to 1 Jul: 10 ± 4. Combined distribution μ≈120, σ≈6.4 ⇒ Φ((μ–120)/σ)=0.5 baseline. Adjusted for asymmetric tail and qualitative factors → 58 % Yes, 42 % No.

Checklist:
1. Will tracker show ≥120 “Done” objectives on/after 1 Jul 25.  
2. Base-rate ~50 % (40 % of 300 done in 5.5 mo historically plausible).  
3. “58 out of 100 times, ≥120 Done appears.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) 105 Done 16 Apr; (ii) ~0.3 Done/day Feb→Apr; (iii) only +15 more needed; (iv) deceleration & legal reversals risk.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden mass downgrades after adverse court decisions could drop count <100.  
6. Status-quo (~current 110) leans toward Yes with just modest continued pace → slight nudge upward.

Probability: 58%

7. **The Daily Dot article (February 25, 2025)**: Reports over 36% of Project 2025 implemented; states tracker monitors 297 objectives with 88% of Executive Office objectives achieved. Quality: Data from February but provides specific percentages.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple independent sources (Heatmap, Grist, Medium, Daily Dot) consistently report 32-36% of objectives already completed by April/May 2025, representing ~100-107 completed objectives out of ~300 total.
- Key Project 2025 architects hold influential positions implementing the agenda (Vought at OMB identified as a "chief architect").
- The administration has demonstrated consistent implementation momentum from January through April.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Tracker creator Adrienne Cobb's methodology appears robust, extracting ~300 measurable objectives from the 920-page document.
- 60+ objectives reported as "in progress" as of April 30 (Grist), representing a pipeline of near-term completions.
- Early implementation targeted "low-hanging fruit" via executive action (Cobb's analysis), suggesting a strategic approach.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Potential legal challenges may slow future implementation (mentioned in Grist article).
- Speculation about shifting administration priorities in coming months.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- Today: May 16, 2025
- Resolution date: July 1, 2025
- Timeframe: 46 days remaining

If the timeframe were halved (23 days), my prediction would decrease moderately as there would be less time to convert "in progress" items to "done" status. The administration would need to maintain its current pace to reach the threshold.

If doubled (92 days), my prediction would increase substantially, as the administration would have ample time to convert the 60+ "in progress" objectives and initiate new implementations, making 120 completions nearly certain.

## (d) Justification

Based on the most recent reliable data, approximately 100-107 objectives have already been completed as of April/early May 2025. With 46 days remaining until July 1st, only 13-20 additional objectives need to be completed to reach the 120 threshold.

Given that 60+ objectives were reported as "in progress" as of April 30, even a conservative conversion rate of these items to "done" status would likely push the total over 120. The administration has demonstrated the capability to implement 100+ objectives in the first 90-120 days of the term. With key Project 2025 authors in influential positions (Vought at OMB described as "chief architect"), the institutional mechanisms are firmly in place to continue implementation.

Potential obstacles include legal challenges and implementation difficulty as "easier" objectives are completed. However, the closeness to the target (needing only 13-20 more completions) makes these obstacles unlikely to prevent reaching 120 objectives.

# Probability calibration

My outside view analysis indicated a 92% probability of reaching 120 completed objectives. My inside view analysis strongly supports this conclusion based on:

1. Current completion pace (100-107 objectives already completed)
2. Significant pipeline of "in progress" items (60+)
3. Demonstrated implementation capability (100+ objectives in first 90-120 days)
4. Strategic positioning of Project 2025 architects in key roles

Even accounting for potential slowdowns or legal challenges, the current trajectory strongly indicates the 120 threshold will be reached given how close the administration already is to this target. I maintain the 92% probability as well-calibrated.

# Checklist:
1. Will Project 2025 Tracker classify ≥120 objectives as "Done" on July 1, 2025? My analysis focuses precisely on this tracker's classification.
2. Outside view base rate: 92% probability based on implementation pace and completion status.
3. 92 out of 100 times, the Project 2025 Tracker will classify at least 120 objectives as "Done" by July 1, 2025.
4. Key evidence: Multiple sources confirm 100-107 objectives already completed; 60+ objectives "in progress"; consistently sustained implementation pace; Project 2025 authors in key positions.
5. Blind-spot: Court injunctions blocking implementation of multiple objectives currently counted as "done."
6. Status quo trajectory clearly points toward exceeding 120 completed objectives by July 1.

Probability: 92%
Predicted Probability: 92.0%

**Daily Dot article (February 25, 2025)**
- Reports over 36% of Project 2025 implemented (~108 objectives)
- Cites tracker creator "rusticgorilla" (Adrienne Cobb)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Consistent completion reporting across sources**: Multiple independent sources (Grist, Medium, Daily Dot) report 32-36% completion (100-108 objectives) between February and April 2025.
- **Department-specific implementation data**: Detailed breakdown showing varying completion rates by department (USAID at ~92%, Energy at ~40%, EPA at ~40%).
- **Established methodology**: Tracker creator Adrienne Cobb identified ~300 measurable objectives from the 920-page blueprint, providing a consistent measurement framework.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Implementation pace pattern**: Initial rapid implementation of ~100 objectives in first 100 days, suggesting capability to complete at least 20 more by July.
- **Expert assessments**: Former Project 2025 director told Politico implementation was "beyond wildest dreams," indicating strong commitment.
- **Executive action focus**: Multiple sources note administration prioritizing executive actions that don't require Congress, enhancing implementation ability.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Legal challenges**: Multiple sources mention lawsuits, but insufficient data on how significantly this will slow implementation.
- **Potential classification inconsistencies**: Some ambiguity in how objectives are classified as "done" vs. "in progress."

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- **Current date**: May 16, 2025
- **Target date**: July 1, 2025
- **Remaining time**: 46 days

If the timeframe were halved (23 days), probability would drop significantly (to ~70%) as there would be less time to implement additional objectives from the current ~105 to reach 120.

If the timeframe were doubled (92 days), probability would increase to ~95%, as the additional time would almost certainly allow enough implementations to reach 120 threshold given demonstrated pace.

## (d) Justification

The outside view base rate of 85% is justified by:

1. **Current completion status**: Approximately 105 out of 301 objectives (34.9%) were "done" by mid-April 2025.

2. **Required progress**: Need ~15 more objectives completed in remaining ~75 days (from mid-April to July 1).

3. **Historical pace analysis**:
   - Initial pace: ~108 objectives in first ~39 days (~2.8 objectives/day)
   - Even at 10% of initial pace (0.28 objectives/day), would complete 21 more by July 1
   - Even at 5% of initial pace (0.14 objectives/day), would complete 10 more by July 1

4. **Structural advantages for continued progress**:
   - Focus on executive actions that bypass congressional approval
   - Strategic prioritization of "low-hanging fruit" (per tracker creator)
   - Strong administration commitment to agenda implementation

5. **Potential headwinds**:
   - Legal challenges to some implementations
   - Increasing difficulty of remaining objectives
   - Public opposition to controversial measures

Given the strong early implementation evidence and the small additional number needed to reach 120, the outside view probability of 85% appears well-calibrated, with a slight adjustment upward to 88% warranted by the consistent implementation evidence.

## Probability calibration

I've carefully evaluated the supporting evidence and the projected trajectory. While the initial pace suggested completion of ~2.8 objectives per day, I recognize this will naturally decelerate. However, even a 95% deceleration would yield completion of ~14 more objectives by July 1, bringing the total to ~119.

The strongest factor supporting reaching 120 objectives is the small gap between current status (~105) and target (120), requiring completion of only ~5% of total objectives in the remaining 46 days.

The most significant risk factors are legal challenges and the increasing difficulty of remaining objectives. However, given the administration's demonstrated commitment and strategic approach, these factors are unlikely to prevent reaching the 120 threshold.

A 88% probability corresponds to 7.3:1 odds in favor of reaching 120 objectives, which aligns with the evidence of strong progress to date and the relatively small additional progress needed.

## Checklist:
1. Resolution: Will Project 2025 Tracker show ≥120 objectives marked "Done" when Metaculus checks on/after July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view: 85% probability based on implementation pace and time remaining
3. Consistency: 88/100 times, tracker would show ≥120 objectives as "Done" by July 1 given current pace
4. Key evidence: 105 objectives already "done" by mid-April; only ~15 more needed in 75 days; strong executive implementation focus
5. Blind spot: Court ruling halts/reverses multiple implementations, reducing "Done" count
6. Status quo: Continued implementation progress is the status quo trajectory

Probability: 88%
Predicted Probability: 88.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will the Project 2025 Tracker show at least 120 objectives marked Done when accessed on or after July 1, 2025? (Today is May 16, 2025, so there are 46 days until resolution.)

2. Source analysis  
a. Grist (April 30, 2025): Reliable environmental outlet; reports ~100 objectives Done (~33% of ~300) and 60+ in progress after ≈4 months. Strong detail, low ideological slant on counts.  
b. Heatmap.news (Feb 17, 2025): Data‐driven politics site; by Day 25, Tracker showed 32% implemented/in progress. Corroborates Grist numbers.  
c. Facebook group post (date unspecified): Low reliability; announces Tracker launch and invites activism but no new counts.  
d. Fast Company (Feb 28, 2025): Business magazine; reports tracker methodology and 36% Done by late Feb. Reliable on visitor traffic, confirms completion rate.  
e. Governing for Impact/Center for Progressive Reform (via Grist): Finds only ~20% of climate/environment measures done; narrower scope, but confirms environment rollbacks slower.  
f. The Conversation (May 14, 2025): Profiles Russ Vought; explains institutional drivers (OMB, DOGE) but no counts. Reliable context on power structure.  
g. Inside Higher Ed (Apr 15, 2025): Finds ~1/3 of higher‐ed objectives done in first 85 days. Matches overall pace.  

3. Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong evidence:  
- Multiple independent sources (Grist, Heatmap, Fast Company, Inside Higher Ed) converge on ~100 Done by late April → ~33%.  
- Clear causal mechanism: early “low-hanging fruit” implemented rapidly; remaining objectives harder/legal.  

Moderate evidence:  
- 60+ objectives “in progress” suggests a pipeline that could finish in next 46 days if pace stays moderate.  
- Institutional impetus (Vought/OMB, DOGE) remains high, pushing for swift completion.  

Weak evidence:  
- Anecdotal activism metrics do not directly affect completion pace.  
- Speculative legal challenges could block progress but magnitude uncertain.  

4. Reference‐class & out-of-sample considerations  
Reference class is the Project 2025 implementation pace itself. Initial rate:  
  • Jan (≈30 days): +18% (~54 objectives)  
  • Feb (≈28 days): +14–18% (~42–54 more)  
  • Mar–Apr (≈60 days): +0–1% (~0–3 more)  
Deceleration is stark. July 1 is 46 days out—less than Jan or Feb. But “in progress” pool is large.  

5. Timeframe sensitivity  
- If timeframe halved (~23 days): must finish ~20 objectives → ≈0.9/day. Unlikely given recent slowdown. Probability would drop by ~20–30 points.  
- If timeframe doubled (~92 days): same 20 objectives in 92 days → ≈0.2/day. Very plausible. Probability would rise by ~10–15 points.  

6. Justification & inside view adjustment  
Base rate (out-of-sample) suggests slim chance to jump from 33% to 40% in 46 days given slowdown (perhaps ≈30%). But:  
  • Pipeline of 60+ in-progress objectives (moderate evidence) could complete quickly if the administration prioritizes them.  
  • Strong institutional mandate and minimal legislative resistance (much via executive action) support acceleration.  
  • Recent slowdown could reverse if the White House orders a final push for early wins ahead of an anticipated political backlash.  

Balancing these: the pipeline and institutional push moderately offset the deceleration trend. This yields an inside‐view probability above base—roughly 55%.

Probability calibration  
Given strong convergence on current counts, clear deceleration pattern, but also a sizable in-progress backlog and high executive drive, I assign 55% to reaching ≥120 Done by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: ✔ “≥120 Done by July 1 out of ~300 objectives, 46 days away.”  
2. Base rate: ✔ ~33% as of late April; raised to 55% by inside‐view.  
3. Consistency: ✔ “55 out of 100 times tracker hits 120+ Done by July 1.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   - ~100 Done as of late April (strong)  
   - 60+ in progress (moderate)  
   - Sharp slowdown after Feb (strong)  
   - Executive action remains unblocked (moderate)  
5. Blind spot: Legal setbacks or resource constraints abruptly stall in-progress objectives.  
6. Status quo: Without renewed push, likely stays near 100–105; modest push needed to hit 120.

Probability: 55%
Predicted Probability: 55.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question and resolution criteria  
   “By July 1, 2025 (46 days from today), will the crowdsourced Project 2025 Tracker show at least 120 of its ~300 objectives marked as ‘Done’?”

2. Source analysis  
   • Grist (Apr 30): Reputable environmental outlet. Reports ≈100 “Done” and 60 “In Progress” after ~100 days. Factual.  
   • Heatmap.News (Feb 17): Tracker author pulled ~300 objectives; 32% done by mid-Feb (~96). Reliable tech‐policy reporting.  
   • The Daily Dot/Fast Company (Feb 25/28): Tracker shows ~36% complete (~108) in late Feb. Credible first‐hand interviews.  
   • AFSCME blog (Apr 16): Labor‐union perspective; confirms ≈100 implemented early via executive actions. Advocacy‐slanted but factual on EOs.  
   • Perplexity scrape (undated): Automated, less reliable. Gives early‐term pace (18% end-Jan, 32% mid-Feb).  
   • Brookings Reg Tracker (May 14): High‐quality but tracks broader regulatory rollbacks, not specific objectives. Contextual.  

3. Evidence analysis (weighting relevant factors)  
   Strong evidence:  
     – Multiple trackers (Grist, Heatmap, Fast Company) agree: ≈100–110 objectives done by late April/early May.  
     – Direct count from the Project 2025 Tracker as primary data.  
   Moderate evidence:  
     – Early‐term pace: 1.5–2 objectives/week; slowed from ~1.8 to ~1.4 per week over time.  
     – Legal challenges (courts reinstating funds, injunctions) create drag on further “Done” classifications.  
   Weak evidence:  
     – Potential “blitz” of last‐minute EOs; possible but unquantified.  
     – Insider influence (Vought/OMB) could accelerate rulemaking, but marginalized by courts.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
   • Horizon: 46 days (~6.5 weeks) from May 16 to July 1.  
   • If horizon halved (23 days): only ~3–5 additional objectives likely → very unlikely to reach 120.  
   • If horizon doubled (92 days): likely ~13–20 additions → high probability to surpass 120.  

5. Justification and inside‐view adjustment  
   Outside view base rate: 60% (admin likely to hit 120 based on past pace).  
   Inside‐view shifts:  
     – Remaining objectives are harder (require legislation or drawn‐out rulemakings). Courts have blocked a number of early rollbacks.  
     – Pace has decelerated from 1.8/w to ~1.0–1.4/w. At best‐recent pace (1.4/w × 6.5 wks ≈ 9), tracker reaches ~110–120.  
     – Potential late push of quick EOs (e.g., small agency reorganizations) could add 5–10 more, but uncertainty is high.  
   Net adjustment: slow‐down and legal frictions reduce probability from 60% to ≈45%.  

6. Other considerations  
   • Blind‐spot: A surprise surge in agency reorganization orders (e.g., Schedule F reinstatement, mass regulatory rollbacks) could add >10 “Done” items rapidly, pushing probability back upward.  
   • Status quo: No sudden change suggests current slow pace will continue.  

Probability calibration  
Given the strong base‐rate support and credible slow‐down factors, a middle‐of‐the‐road estimate (~45%) reflects moderate uncertainty but leans toward the “No” side.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: ✓ question, resolution, timeframe clear.  
2. Base rate: 60% from tracker trend.  
3. Consistency: “45 out of 100 times, the tracker hits ≥120 objectives by July 1.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   - ≈100–110 objectives done as of early May (strong)  
   - Pace slowed to ~1–1.4/week (moderate)  
   - Legal injunctions blocking rollbacks (moderate)  
   - Potential last‐minute EO burst (weak)  
5. Blind‐spot: Major sudden regulatory blitz adding >10 objectives.  
6. Status quo: Continuation of current slow pace likely.

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Heatmap (17 Feb 25): reputable U.S. climate-politics site; quotes tracker author; earliest hard number (“32 % implemented or in progress”). Factual portion solid; ∼3-month old.  
• Daily Dot (25 Feb 25): mid-tier tech/culture outlet; cites tracker screen grabs; shows 36 % “implemented” (≃90-95 Done). Useful but not primary.  
• Medium post by C.G. Wipper (16 Apr 25): opinionated but relays tracker count “105 of 301 Done”. Factual part verifiable; four weeks old.  
• Grist (30 Apr 25): respected non-profit newsroom; quotes tracker (“roughly one-third ≈100+ Done, 60+ In-Progress”). Good quality, 2½ weeks old.  
• Inside Higher Ed, BBC, The Conversation – background on Project 2025, not on numeric tracker status.  
• AskNews dump – largely unrelated infrastructure stories; only item relevant is “Tracking the Purge” (Medium) which duplicates the 105 figure.  
Overall, we have two independent, recent (mid-Apr) sources giving ≈105 “Done” and consistent earlier counts (≈90-95 late Feb). No May numbers yet.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong  
• Consistency of two independent outlets (Grist, Medium) giving ~100-105 Done by late April.  
Moderate  
• Early pace: +10-15 objectives moved to “Done” between late Feb and mid-Apr (≈0.3/day); suggests momentum but already slowing.  
• Structural ease: many remaining items need only EO or agency memo (still executable inside 6 weeks).  
• Tracker is activist-maintained and updated quickly (author publicly solicits crowdsourcing).  
Weak  
• Potential reversals from court rulings could move items back to “In progress”; frequency unknown.  
• Unknown May count; sample error ±5-7.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days left to resolution: 46 (16 May → 1 Jul).  
Halved (23 d): probability would drop ~10 pts (less time to add 10-15 items).  
Doubled (92 d): would rise ~15-20 pts as far more time to accumulate >120.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside view baseline: Using logistic-type adoption, an aggressive first-six-months White-House blueprint usually hits ~35-40 % of tractable objectives (historical Heritage claim: 2/3 in four years ⇒ ≈40 % in first half-year). Baseline chance of ≥120/300 (~40 %) by 1 Jul therefore ~50 %.  
Inside view adjustments:  
+ Momentum: 105 already achieved, need only +15 (≈14 % of remaining 195) in 46 days → plausible (+5 pts).  
+ Many leftover “easy” agency memos still listed by tracker author (+3 pts).  
– Deceleration evident (15 gains in ~50 days) and “low-hanging fruit” largely taken (–6 pts).  
– Legal/appropriations push-back could downgrade some Done (–4 pts).  
Net shift: +5 – 10 + ? ≈ +8 pts → 58 % final.

(c) Yes-path factors (need any ~15 of…): new DOE office closures, additional DEI revocations, mifepristone mail halt, more visa crack-downs, CFPB defunding memo.  
No-path factors: courts vacate prior EOs, tracker re-classifies, author falls behind, or Trump pivoting to Cong. battles slows EO output.

Probability calibration
Mean current Done assumed 110 ± 5 (sd). Expected increment to 1 Jul: 10 ± 4. Combined distribution μ≈120, σ≈6.4 ⇒ Φ((μ–120)/σ)=0.5 baseline. Adjusted for asymmetric tail and qualitative factors → 58 % Yes, 42 % No.

Checklist:
1. Will tracker show ≥120 “Done” objectives on/after 1 Jul 25.  
2. Base-rate ~50 % (40 % of 300 done in 5.5 mo historically plausible).  
3. “58 out of 100 times, ≥120 Done appears.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) 105 Done 16 Apr; (ii) ~0.3 Done/day Feb→Apr; (iii) only +15 more needed; (iv) deceleration & legal reversals risk.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden mass downgrades after adverse court decisions could drop count <100.  
6. Status-quo (~current 110) leans toward Yes with just modest continued pace → slight nudge upward.
