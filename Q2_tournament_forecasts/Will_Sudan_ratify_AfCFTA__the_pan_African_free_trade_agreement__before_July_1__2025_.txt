Analysis:
Sudan signed the AfCFTA in 2018 but has yet to complete domestic ratification. Key context includes the date of signature, parliamentary or cabinet approvals, the draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy review (2023), and any subsequent stakeholder consultations or public debates. Political instability—military coups in 2021 and 2023—and economic crises may have delayed ratification. I need to establish Sudan’s formal steps toward ratification, deadlines set by the AU, and obstacles (legal, political, logistical) that have historically slowed or stalled ratification among other African states.

Current context LLM output:
Analysis:
Sudan’s ratification of the AfCFTA hinges on the transitional government completing both executive approval and parliamentary ratification before July 1, 2025. The Draft National Implementation Strategy was validated by stakeholders, indicating executive-level engagement, but no formal ratification has yet been recorded. Key unknowns include:
• Whether the Council of Ministers has approved the ratification bill.
• Whether Sudan’s Legislative Council has scheduled or passed the ratification vote.
• Any recent statements by the Foreign Ministry, Prime Minister’s office, or AU/IGAD regarding an impending ratification.
• Potential delays due to security, economic instability, or political transitions.
With less than one month remaining, we need up-to-date primary sources on official government actions or public commitments. These will inform an inside-view adjustment to our baseline probability that Sudan will ratify AfCFTA in time.

<Summary source="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business-tech/ea-faces-160m-forfeiture-in-tax-revenues-under-afcfta-4974722">
The EastAfrican (March 22, 2025) reports on a UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) study warning that initial tariff-revenue losses under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) will be outweighed by longer-term gains from expanded intra-African trade. Key points:

Facts & Statistics  
• 2025 tariff-revenue loss across Africa: 3 percent of total (≈ US$2 billion)  
• East African Community (EAC) 2025 losses (approx.):  
 – Rwanda: 3.5 percent (US$70 million)  
 – Uganda: 2.1 percent (US$42 million)  
 – Kenya: 1.5 percent (US$30 million)  
 – Tanzania: 0.9 percent (US$18 million)  
• Four EAC states face combined loss of up to US$160 million in 2025  
• Projected tariff-revenue decline by 2045: 10.7 percent (US$21.1 billion), with an interim 8.2 percent drop (US$7 billion) by 2030  
• Countries most affected by 2045 (> 15 percent tariff loss): Cameroon, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe  
• AfCFTA-area GDP: US$3.3 trillion; 1.3 billion-person market from January 1, 2021  
• As of January 2025: 54 signatories (all except Eritrea); 48 ratifications  

ECA / UNECA Findings & Opinions  
• “The decline in tariff revenues would be rather marginal in the early years of AfCFTA implementation…” – Economic Report on Africa, ECA  
• “Revenues generated from the large increase in intra-African trade would also … help in reaching higher levels of welfare, despite reduction in revenues from customs duties.” – ECA report  
• An AfCFTA Adjustment Fund, backed by Afreximbank, will help vulnerable countries offset tariff-revenue losses  

AfCFTA Implementation Details  
• Phase 1 (in force Jan 1, 2021): trade in goods, services, dispute-resolution procedures  
• Phase 2 (adopted Feb 2024): investment, competition, intellectual property, digital trade, women & youth in trade  
• Liberalisation timelines:  
 – Least-Developed Countries (LDCs): zero tariffs on non-sensitive goods by 2030; sensitive goods by 2033  
 – Non-LDCs: zero tariffs on non-sensitive goods by 2026; sensitive goods by 2031 (sensitive lines ≤ 7 percent of total)  
 – Exclusions: up to 3 percent of tariff lines, capped at 10 percent of intra-African import value  
• Target by 2033: 97 percent of intra-African goods trade duty-free  

Long-Term Trade Gains (UNECA projections by 2045, vs. no-AfCFTA baseline)  
• Intra-African exports up 45 percent (US$275.7 billion)  
• Agri-food trade up 60 percent (US$58.6 billion)  
• Industry trade up 48 percent (US$165.6 billion)  
• Services trade up 34 percent (US$4.9 billion)  
• Energy & mining trade up 28 percent (US$46.6 billion)

<Summary source="https://tradeunionsinafcfta.org/afcfta-update-current-status-and-next-steps/">
Here is a concise summary of the key points from “AfCFTA update: Current status and next steps” (Gerhard Erasmus, March 5, 2024):

• Signatures and ratifications  
  – 54 of 55 AU members have signed the AfCFTA Agreement (only Eritrea has not).  
  – 47 have ratified; the eight non-state parties are Benin, Eritrea, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.  

• Launching the Trade-in-Goods regime (Articles 1 & 7, AfCFTA Protocol on Trade in Goods)  
  – Each State Party must negotiate, domestically promulgate and have the AU Assembly adopt its Schedule of Tariff Concessions.  
  – Customs-readiness and clear reciprocal benefits are required.  
  – Rules of Origin agreed so far cover 92.3% of all tariff lines; outstanding sectors are textiles, clothing and automotives.  

• Provisional Schedules of Tariff Concessions (PSTCs)  
  – 45 PSTCs have been submitted and verified as compliant.  
  – Outstanding submissions: Djibouti, Libya, Mozambique, Somalia, the Saharawi Republic and Sudan.  

• Interaction with existing Regional Economic Community FTAs and Customs Unions  
  – REC FTA/CU arrangements continue to apply; AfCFTA tariffs apply only where REC preferences are not used.  
  – Exporters/importers choose which preferential regime to invoke.  

• Priority sectors and special economic zones  
  – Key sectors for industrialization: automotives, pharmaceuticals, transport & logistics, agri-business.  
  – Special Economic Arrangements/Zones expected to feature prominently; details (including acceptable incentives and corresponding Rules of Origin under Annex 2) are still being finalized.  

• Services, investment, digital trade and other protocols  
  – Guided Trade Initiative for goods is underway; extension to services (GTi S) is under preparation per the 10th AfCFTA Council directive.  
  – Investment Protocol adopted by AU Assembly in February 2023 (pending review of Articles 19 & 21 on expropriation/disputes).  
  – Digital Trade and Women & Youth in Trade Protocols reportedly completed and adopted by AU Assembly in February 2024, though key provisions (e.g. Rules of Origin, customs duties in the Digital Trade Protocol) remain to be finalized.  
  – Protocol on Intellectual Property Rights awaits negotiation of its Annexes; Competition Policy Protocol is apparently finalized.  

• Next steps  
  – Submission of outstanding tariff offers (including Sudan’s).  
  – Finalization of Rules of Origin for remaining tariff lines and special economic zones.  
  – Completion of wording for outstanding protocol articles (Digital Trade, IPR).  
  – Extension of the Guided Trade Initiative to services.

<Summary source="https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/3910b863-a1a0-5ce3-be05-9c1345685838">
Here is a concise summary of the fDi Intelligence article “The five hurdles to Africa’s continental free trade area” (June 5, 2024):

Key context and data  
• The AfCFTA treaty entered into force on May 30, 2019, with 24 initial approvals; trade under the AfCFTA framework began in January 2021.  
• 54 of the 55 African Union members have signed the agreement (only Eritrea has not); 47 have ratified it.  
• Among 11 large African countries with available data, intra-African trade was US $85.3 billion in 2023 (11.8 % of their total trade), down from 13.2 % in 2019 (Trade Data Monitor).  
• Continent-wide, intra-African trade as a share of global trade fell from 14.5 % in 2021 to 13.7 % in 2022 (UN data).  
• A pilot phase launched in October 2022 among eight countries for 96 products; so far African states have only committed to removing tariffs on 90 % of products, and these tariff-removal commitments are not yet reflected in national schedules. Services and digital-trade protocols remain pending.

The five main hurdles

1. Countries yet to ratify  
  • Seven signatories remain non-state parties: Benin, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.  
  • “Even with agreements like AfCFTA, we’re still in a situation of perpetual negotiations between more than 50 member states, which requires consensus…there are more than 50 bilateral economic interests to resolve,” says Marie Wilke, director at consultancy Africa Practice.  

2. Disparities in implementation capacity  
  • The International Trade Centre (ITC) reports that fewer than ten countries have fully operational domestic AfCFTA implementation.  
  • Rules-of-origin negotiations for sensitive products (e.g. cars, textiles) remain unresolved, delaying tariff liberalization.  

3. Harmonizing regional economic communities (RECs)  
  • The AfCFTA depends on eight sub-regional RECs as “building blocks,” but their levels of integration vary widely.  
  • Dorothy Tembo, deputy executive director at ITC, notes some RECs—like the East African Community—are more mature, making continent-wide rule harmonization difficult.  

4. Limited access to trade finance  
  • The annual African trade-finance gap is estimated at US $81 billion (BACB), with some estimates up to $120 billion.  
  • “Every single [African trade] delegation that we speak to has this issue on the table,” says Ms Tembo. Lack of finance hinders businesses’ ability to grow and trade across borders.  

5. Inadequate transport and logistics infrastructure  
  • The World Bank’s 2023 Logistics Performance Index ranks many African countries poorly on customs processes, tracking and tracing, and shipment times.  
  • John Miller, chief economic analyst at Trade Data Monitor, concludes AfCFTA’s success is “only as good as the logistics, infrastructure and commercial health of [trading] companies.”

• States whose PSTCs are verified/adopted are urged to publish them in their official gazettes to commence preferential trade.  

4. Rules of Origin  
• 88.3% of tariff lines agreed.  
• Outstanding negotiations in two sectors:

• Functions: capacity building in investment policy; coordination among investment agencies and stakeholders; promotion of intra-African investment.  
• Host-country selection criteria, structure and financing plans to be released soon; South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania have expressed hosting interest.  

10. Future challenges & financing  
• Emphasizes need for Africa-wide trade finance and continental financial institutions.  
• Recommends recognizing Afrexim Bank as an AU Specialized Agency and coordinating African Development Bank, AfriFC, and REC development banks to finance trade-related infrastructure (corridors, energy, value chains, etc.).  

11. Island States outreach  
• In September (year unspecified), in partnership with Comoros, the Secretariat will conduct AfCFTA awareness activities across Africa’s island States (Cape Verde, Comoros, Mauritius, Madagascar, Sao Tome & Principe, Seychelles), targeting financial institutions and SMEs.

Disclaimer: This summary is based on extracted content from TheAfricaReport.com and may not capture the article in its entirety.

Key points from “Trading among African countries will not happen overnight, says AfCFTA boss Wamkele Mene” (June 13, 2024):

1. Context & comparison  
   • AfCFTA launched Phase I (goods) on 1 January 2021.  
   • Mene likens Africa’s integration timeline to the EU’s 72-year journey to a customs union—Africa has been operational for just over three years.

2. Ratifications & tariff schedules  
   • 54 AU member states signed the AfCFTA Agreement; 43 have deposited ratification instruments.  
   • 37 countries have submitted tariff liberalization schedules, aiming to eliminate tariffs on 90% of intra-African goods over 5–10 years.

3. Digital tools & trade facilitation  
   • The AfCFTA online portal (launched March 2023) now hosts some 9,000 tariff lines and supports e-certificates of origin.  
   • Over 200 e-certificates have been issued to date, reducing paperwork and border delays.

4. Pilot corridors & early results  
   • Several “one-stop” border posts and transport corridors are in pilot phases (e.g., North Corridor linking Kenya, Uganda, DR Congo).  
   • Early data show up to 20% reductions in transit times on pilot routes, though full statistics are still emerging.

5. Infrastructure & non-tariff barriers  
   • Persistent challenges include poor roads, limited rail capacity and customs procedures that still impose non-tariff barriers in excess of 70–80% of shipments.  
   • Harmonization of standards and mutual recognition of inspections remains a work in progress.

6. Financing & technical support  
   • The African Development Bank, UN Economic Commission for Africa and bilateral partners (e.g., GIZ) have mobilized over US$1.3 billion for AfCFTA implementation projects.  
   • National implementation strategies are being drafted—in Sudan, for instance, stakeholders recently reviewed a draft strategy under IGAD facilitation.

7. Outlook & timeline  
   • Mene cautions that deeper integration steps (customs union, common market) may take two to three decades.  
   • He urges member states to accelerate domestic legal reforms, finalize tariff schedules and strengthen private-sector engagement if they wish to see tangible gains before mid-2025.

Here is a concise summary of the Political Geography Now article on Mali:

• Rebel advances  
  – March 11: The Tuareg-led National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) seized Tessalit, in Mali’s far north (site of a military base and airport).  
  – March 13: MNLA stormed Diré and Goundam (near Timbuktu); their current status is unclear.  

• Coup in Bamako  
  – March 21: Malian military overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré, blaming him for failing to contain the northern rebellion.  
  – March 23: In the ensuing chaos, MNLA captured Anefis, on the Gao–Kidal road.  

• Further rebel claims and confusion  
  – MNLA says it will soon take Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu; reports indicate Malian troops in Kidal are negotiating surrender under rebel encirclement.  
  – Islamist group Ansar Dine also claims control of Tinzaouaten, Tessalit and Aguelhok—territories widely attributed to MNLA.  
  – Local experts doubt genuine cooperation between MNLA and Ansar Dine despite shared Tuareg origins.  

• Regional repercussions  
  – Following the coup, Mali was suspended from the African Union, becoming (with Madagascar) one of only two AU members currently under suspension.

Query: What recent government or parliamentary statements have been made about Sudan’s ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement?
Here are the relevant news articles:

**US Revives 'Quartet' Group to Stop War in Sudan**
The United States has revived the 'Quartet' group, which was formed to support the transition to civilian rule in Sudan after the ousting of former President Omar al-Bashir, to stop the war in Sudan, which is entering its third year. The Quartet group includes the US, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE. The US State Department held a meeting on Tuesday, which included Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, Egyptian Ambassador to the US Metz Zahran, Saudi Ambassador to the US Rima bint Bandar, and UAE Ambassador to the US Youssef Al Otaiba. The meeting aimed to intensify efforts to stop the conflict and reach a political settlement that ensures stability in Sudan. The US has called for a ceasefire and a return to negotiations, while the Sudanese government has expressed reservations about the Quartet's involvement, citing concerns about the participation of countries that support the Rapid Support Forces. The Quartet has called for the intensification of efforts to pressure the warring parties to stop fighting and reach a political settlement. The Sudanese government has proposed a roadmap for a peaceful solution, which includes a transitional phase and conditions for a ceasefire. The US has also proposed a meeting in Switzerland between the Sudanese government and the Rapid Support Forces, but the Sudanese government has refused to participate, insisting on implementing the previous agreement before any new talks. The Quartet's move comes after the failure of the 'Jeddah Platform' initiative, which was launched by the US and Saudi Arabia, and the failure of the parties to adhere to the terms of the two agreements, particularly the Rapid Support Forces, which failed to vacate civilian sites, leading to the suspension of talks in late 2023. The US has also been criticized for its lack of attention to Africa, and the delay in forming its teams concerned with African affairs in the National Security Council and the State Department, which has hindered the development of a clear policy towards Sudan. The Quartet's success is conditional on resolving the differences and activating the role of the Arab League, and formulating an approach that takes into account the aspirations of the Sudanese people for peace, without rearming the Rapid Support Forces.

**International Condemnation After Attack on Humanitarian Convoy in Sudan**
The group 'United to Save Lives and Peace in Sudan' has condemned the recent attack on a UN humanitarian convoy in Sudan, calling on the warring parties to respect international law, particularly in protecting civilians and humanitarian workers. The group expressed 'its firm condemnation of the recent attack on a UN humanitarian convoy, resulting in the deaths of several humanitarian workers and the destruction of vital aid.' They emphasized that 'attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, including humanitarian workers and their equipment, constitute a grave violation of international humanitarian law.' The group, composed of Saudi Arabia, the US, Switzerland, the UAE, Egypt, the African Union, and the UN, urged the parties in conflict to 'fully respect the provisions of international law, particularly those related to the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers.' They also called for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to all those in need in Sudan, 'in a context of acute deterioration of the situation and unprecedented growing needs.' The group offered its condolences to the families, colleagues, and communities of the victims who lost their lives while performing their duty to assist the most vulnerable. On Tuesday, five people were killed and others injured in an attack on a humanitarian convoy in the North Darfur state, in western Sudan, according to a joint statement by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF). The attack also caused the burning of trucks and damage to essential humanitarian aid. The convoy, consisting of 15 trucks, was attempting to deliver food aid to the city of El-Fasher, in the north of Darfur. The convoy's route had been previously established, and all parties had been informed of the itinerary. In this context, the Sudanese government and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have mutually accused each other of being responsible for the attack on the humanitarian convoy. Since May 10, 2024, the city of El-Fasher has been the scene of intense fighting between the army and the RSF, despite international warnings about the dangers of these clashes in this city, which is the center of humanitarian operations for the five states of Darfur (west). Additionally, Sudanese authorities have accused the RSF of conducting drone attacks on civilian installations, including power stations and infrastructure in northern and eastern cities, without any reaction from the RSF.

**High Stakes for Ramaphosa's Meeting with Trump**
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is meeting Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday to discuss new trade agreements. However, analysts warn that the meeting may be high-stakes, given the current tensions between the two countries. Meanwhile, in Mali, the military junta has banned all political parties, silenced dissent, and delayed elections, raising concerns about the country's democracy. Additionally, the US government plans to reduce its diplomatic presence in Africa, which could create a vacuum that other countries may fill. Furthermore, US President Donald Trump's tariffs on African exports have triggered economic fallout across the continent. In other news, the Sahel region is experiencing a new era in mineral extraction, with local companies being granted licenses to mine copper. However, this has raised concerns about the environmental impact and the role of military governments in the region. In South Sudan, the arrest of Vice President Riek Machar could trigger a new wave of fighting, while in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the fall of Bukavu could complicate the conflict. The US has also proposed a peace initiative for the DRC, but it has been rebuffed by the Rwandan government. Russia's influence in Africa may weaken after the ousting of dictator Bashar Assad, and experts are calling for better governance and transparent elections to ensure Africa's growth. In other news, German investors see business in Africa as too risky, and Senegal's top court has confirmed the ruling party's big election win. Gabon is voting on a new constitution, and Mozambique's government is facing protests over the election result. In South Africa, the new government is arguing about Ukraine, and Russian influence in Bangui is being disguised as culture. The Central African Republic is a testing ground for Moscow's Africa policy, and Sierra Leone's eco-friendly mayor has won the German Africa Prize. In eastern Congo, people are trapped between conflict and crisis, and domestic violence in east Africa is a growing concern.

**Parliament ratifies WTO agreement on fisheries subsidies, marking milestone for Ghana's sustainable ocean governance - MyJoyOnline**
Ghana's Parliament has ratified the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, a landmark decision that marks a renewed national commitment to curbing illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and promoting sustainable fisheries management. The ratification, championed by Hon. Emelia Arthur and Hon. Elizabeth Ofosu-Adjare, aligns with Ghana's Marine Fisheries Management Plan and supports efforts to build a resilient, equitable fisheries sector. The agreement aims to eliminate harmful subsidies contributing to overfishing and IUU practices, particularly on the high seas and waters where fish stocks are overexploited or of unknown status. Ghana's fisheries sector remains a critical pillar of the national economy, providing livelihoods for millions and contributing significantly to food security, nutrition, and foreign exchange earnings. The decision comes at a pivotal time, as the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture prepares to implement the Marine Protected Areas, a measure aimed at replenishing depleted fish stocks and sustaining the livelihoods of coastal communities. According to Minister Ofosu-Adjare, 'This is not just a trade agreement; it is a pact to protect the future of Ghana's marine resources and the millions who depend on them.'

**BRICS Parliamentarians Unite for Multilateral Health Cooperation**
Members of the BRICS parliament have emphasized the need for a multilateral agreement to jointly face future pandemics. According to them, the idea is to strengthen prevention and combat of epidemics, promote equitable access to vaccines, and establish a cooperation model based on solidarity. The president of the Federal Senate, Davi Alcolumbre, highlighted the importance of multilateralism in combating infectious diseases, saying, 'The Covid-19 pandemic reminded us that the virus that kills here kills anywhere in the world, just like other infectious diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and unfortunately, hunger.' He added, 'Why not unite forces for the health of our people? I don't see a reason not to do it, I think we should and can do it.' Poobalan Govender, a member of the National Council of Provinces of South Africa, noted that his country acted with the World Trade Organization (WTO) to break patents of local vaccines, allowing for quick and affordable access to the population. Inna Svyatenko, vice-president of the Federation Council of Russia, emphasized the importance of the Integrated Early Warning System for Infectious Diseases, which aims to provide an early warning of possible health crises, ensuring coordinated action among the 11 BRICS countries. Harivansh Narayan Singh, a member of the Upper House of the Indian Parliament, spoke in defense of multilateral cooperation to face diseases that affect low-income populations, such as malaria and dengue. Mohammad Rashidi, a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran, said that health cooperation should be a point of convergence between countries, and that a new multilateral model of health based on solidarity, justice, and free knowledge should be developed.

**Egypt and Sudan Escalate Opposition to Nile River Basin Agreement - Warsheekh**
Egypt and Sudan have escalated their opposition to the Nile River Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA), citing concerns that it endangers the region's fragile equilibrium. The two countries believe the CFA's enactment threatens their long-standing water rights established under the colonial-era 1929 and 1959 Nile River Agreements. Egypt's President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi emphasized that water security is Egypt's foremost concern, as the Nile provides 98% of the country's water resources. The CFA's ratification by six upstream nations has intensified regional tensions, with Egypt and Sudan advocating for a more inclusive framework that deters unilateral decisions by upstream nations. 'The six-nation commission under the incomplete CFA cannot represent the interests of the entire Nile Basin,' the joint statement declared. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed praised the ratification of the CFA as a landmark move toward a fairer distribution of the Nile's resources, but his remarks have done little to alleviate the concerns of downstream nations. The broader geopolitical effects of the Nile dispute are also becoming more apparent, with Egypt increasing its military presence in Somalia to counter Ethiopia's influence in the region.

**Georges Olemanu's Skepticism about the African Continental Free Trade Area**
Georges Olemanu, a Master's degree candidate at China Foreign Affairs University, expressed skepticism about the African Continental Free Trade Area (ZLEC) agreement signed at the Kigali Summit in 2018. He believes that the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will have more to lose than gain from the common market. Olemanu stated, 'The philosophy of building a united Africa, as envisioned by Nkrumah, is a dream that has been materializing since 1963, with the creation of the Organisation of African Unity (OUA). However, I am skeptical about the declarations of certain authorities from emerging economies and the absence of the Nigerian President at the summit.' He noted that African countries have a low level of intra-regional trade, with only 16% of trade occurring within the continent, compared to 50% among Asian countries and 70% among Europeans. Olemanu warned that the DRC's vulnerability in the face of emerging African economies, such as South Africa, Egypt, and Kenya, is a permanent danger. He emphasized the need for the DRC to industrialize its economy and produce in large quantities to benefit from the system. He also expressed concerns about the potential risks of a fragile security situation in the DRC, which could be exacerbated by the removal of economic borders within the ZLEC.

**US Revives 'Quartet' Group to Stop War in Sudan**
The United States has revived the 'Quartet' group, which was formed to support the transition to civilian rule in Sudan after the ousting of former President Omar al-Bashir, to stop the war in Sudan, which is entering its third year. The Quartet group includes the US, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE. The US State Department held a meeting on Tuesday, which included Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, Egyptian Ambassador to the US Metz Zahran, Saudi Ambassador to the US Rima bint Bandar, and UAE Ambassador to the US Youssef Al Otaiba. The meeting aimed to intensify efforts to stop the conflict and reach a political settlement that ensures stability in Sudan. The US has called for a ceasefire and a return to negotiations, while the Sudanese government has expressed reservations about the Quartet's involvement, citing concerns about the participation of countries that support the Rapid Support Forces. The Quartet has called for the intensification of efforts to pressure the warring parties to stop fighting and reach a political settlement. The Sudanese government has proposed a roadmap for a peaceful solution, which includes a transitional phase and conditions for a ceasefire. The US has also proposed a meeting in Switzerland between the Sudanese government and the Rapid Support Forces, but the Sudanese government has refused to participate, insisting on implementing the previous agreement before any new talks. The Quartet's move comes after the failure of the 'Jeddah Platform' initiative, which was launched by the US and Saudi Arabia, and the failure of the parties to adhere to the terms of the two agreements, particularly the Rapid Support Forces, which failed to vacate civilian sites, leading to the suspension of talks in late 2023. The US has also been criticized for its lack of attention to Africa, and the delay in forming its teams concerned with African affairs in the National Security Council and the State Department, which has hindered the development of a clear policy towards Sudan. The Quartet's success is conditional on resolving the differences and activating the role of the Arab League, and formulating an approach that takes into account the aspirations of the Sudanese people for peace, without rearming the Rapid Support Forces.

**International Condemnation After Attack on Humanitarian Convoy in Sudan**
The group 'United to Save Lives and Peace in Sudan' has condemned the recent attack on a UN humanitarian convoy in Sudan, calling on the warring parties to respect international law, particularly in protecting civilians and humanitarian workers. The group expressed 'its firm condemnation of the recent attack on a UN humanitarian convoy, resulting in the deaths of several humanitarian workers and the destruction of vital aid.' They emphasized that 'attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, including humanitarian workers and their equipment, constitute a grave violation of international humanitarian law.' The group, composed of Saudi Arabia, the US, Switzerland, the UAE, Egypt, the African Union, and the UN, urged the parties in conflict to 'fully respect the provisions of international law, particularly those related to the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers.' They also called for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to all those in need in Sudan, 'in a context of acute deterioration of the situation and unprecedented growing needs.' The group offered its condolences to the families, colleagues, and communities of the victims who lost their lives while performing their duty to assist the most vulnerable. On Tuesday, five people were killed and others injured in an attack on a humanitarian convoy in the North Darfur state, in western Sudan, according to a joint statement by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF). The attack also caused the burning of trucks and damage to essential humanitarian aid. The convoy, consisting of 15 trucks, was attempting to deliver food aid to the city of El-Fasher, in the north of Darfur. The convoy's route had been previously established, and all parties had been informed of the itinerary. In this context, the Sudanese government and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have mutually accused each other of being responsible for the attack on the humanitarian convoy. Since May 10, 2024, the city of El-Fasher has been the scene of intense fighting between the army and the RSF, despite international warnings about the dangers of these clashes in this city, which is the center of humanitarian operations for the five states of Darfur (west). Additionally, Sudanese authorities have accused the RSF of conducting drone attacks on civilian installations, including power stations and infrastructure in northern and eastern cities, without any reaction from the RSF.

**South Sudan Crisis: Over 165,000 Displaced in Last Three Months**
More than 165,000 people have been displaced in the last three months in South Sudan due to the crisis of violence that erupted at the beginning of this year in the African country, amidst fears of a possible collapse of the 2018 peace agreement, according to estimates from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) published on Tuesday. The majority of people who have fled the tensions and conflict, around 100,000, have sought safety in neighboring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Uganda. However, around 65,000 people are internally displaced and are in communities with 'considerable limited access'. 'South Sudan cannot afford another crisis. The youngest country in the world has received over a million people who fled the war in Sudan, while millions of its citizens continue to recover from years of conflict and crisis in their countries,' said Mamadou Dian Balde, regional director of UNHCR for Eastern Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes. The director warned that the fighting and movement restrictions in South Sudan 'have paralyzed' the entry of humanitarian aid, including medicines and medical care, despite the increase in cholera cases, a situation that can be exacerbated by the impending rainy season. However, neighboring countries, which are also struggling with their own conflicts, 'are struggling to cope with the scarcity of resources such as food, water, sanitation, shelter, and medical care.' 'This emergency arrived at the worst time. Many refugees are seeking safety in countries that are facing their own challenges or that are already facing emergencies in the midst of brutal funding cuts,' Balde explained. In recent weeks, South Sudanese authorities have confirmed dozens of deaths in intercommunal clashes in the state of Warrap. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has expressed its 'deep concern' over the escalation of violence and has urged the authorities to intervene and deploy security services to address the situation. 'Urgent intervention by the national government is needed to prevent the conflict from intensifying to catastrophic levels and to unite communities and resolve peacefully the grievances,' said the deputy special representative of the secretary-general, Guang Cong, in a statement, in which he estimated 200 deaths in March this year. 'While UNMISS is doing everything possible to dissuade new mobilizations and conflicts, the government is primarily responsible for protecting civilians and, therefore, we urge the government to quickly deploy security services to prevent more violence and create a safe environment for community dialogue and peace consolidation,' he added.

**Parliamentarian: Price Stability Depends on Regulation and Local Production**
MP Elin Matti praised Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly's statements on the strategic stockpile of essential goods, saying that this step reflects the government's commitment to providing citizens' needs and regulating markets. According to Matti, providing a sufficient stockpile of essential goods contributes to price stability and reduces the impact of global crises on the local market. She emphasized the importance of enhancing market control and combating monopolies to ensure citizens' access to goods at reasonable prices. Matti also called for increased cooperation between the government and the private sector to provide essential goods and expand local production, which would contribute to achieving food security and economic stability. The government has been working to enhance food security and stabilize the local market, with Prime Minister Madbouly holding a meeting to follow up on President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's instructions to provide a reassuring stockpile of essential goods, including red meat. The meeting was attended by several ministers and officials to discuss plans to increase the supply of meat in the markets during the upcoming Eid al-Adha, which sees an increase in demand. The meeting reviewed the government's efforts in this file, including expanding fixed and mobile ports of the Ministry of Agriculture, increasing imports from selected African countries based on detailed studies, and plans to establish new quarries and mines in collaboration with the Future of Sustainable Development Agency. The meeting also announced a new strategic project to establish a national factory for producing infant formula to reduce import costs and promote local manufacturing.

**Cameroun: Un pas de plus vers la Zone de libre-échange continentale africaine**
The Cameroonian government has officially launched the activities of the interministerial committee responsible for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (Zlecaf) agreement. The committee, chaired by Luc Magloire Mbarga Atangana, Minister of Commerce, aims to follow up on the implementation of the agreement and ensure its evaluation. Cameroon has made significant progress in implementing the agreement, including signing, ratifying, and depositing the ratification instruments with the African Union Commission, as well as notifying its market access offers for the trade of goods and services. The committee will define the country's national positions and negotiation strategies to protect Cameroonian interests in the second phase of negotiations, which focuses on investment, competition, intellectual property rights, e-commerce, and trade by women and young people. 'The subjects discussed in the agreement are often complex and multiple. We have integrated issues like investment, competition, and sometimes contentious topics that even within the WTO pose problems, into the Zlecaf framework,' said the Minister of Commerce. The committee will make relevant proposals to the government on all matters related to the implementation of this important instrument of economic integration.

**Africa’s trade goals are realised on local levels primarily with energy, transport projects**
The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) aims to create a single market in Africa with no trade restrictions between countries. While the treaty's architects have finished their work and most African nations have signed on, the implementation is being carried out on local levels. Governments are not businesses and should enable trade opportunities by providing infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and electricity. Malawi and Mozambique have agreed to establish one-stop border posts, and the World Bank is financing road infrastructure improvements in both countries. Bilateral projects are also meeting energy needs, such as the South Sudan-Sudan energy pipeline and the Eastern Electricity Highway Project. The AfCFTA is being realised through individual nations coming together to meet trade needs, with projects such as the Lobito Corridor Railway project and the African Atlantic Gas Pipeline. These projects aim to boost energy security, provide new jobs, and distribute fuel to millions of customers, as envisioned by the AfCFTA architects. The UN Economic Commission on Africa has predicted that the AfCFTA will boost intra-Africa trade by up to 25% by 2040, earning up to US$70 billion in trade that would not exist otherwise.

**African Union Warns of Sudan's Division After Formation of Opposition Forces**
The African Union has warned of the risk of Sudan's division after the formation of opposition forces against the government. The African Union announced, 'its rejection of the Rapid Support Forces and their allied forces forming a parallel government in Sudan.' The African Union warned of the risk of Sudan's division, stating that 'the announcement of the formation of a parallel government in Sudan represents a threat to the country's unity and opens the door to the risks of division.' The move to form a parallel government has been met with widespread rejection locally and internationally, amid concerns of escalating the crisis and dividing the country, which has been experiencing a continuous war for nearly two years. Political and armed groups, along with the Rapid Support Forces, signed a founding charter last week in Nairobi, Kenya, aimed at forming a parallel government in Sudan. According to Sudanese newspaper 'Al-Tahawul', 'the signing ceremony took place in areas controlled by the Rapid Support Forces, under strict security measures and media blackout.' A source close to the organizers confirmed that the signing of the charter was successful, stating that 'the charter aims to form a government of peace and unity in areas controlled by the Rapid Support Forces.' The participating groups have named themselves the 'Sudanese Constitutional Alliance,' which includes various political and armed groups. Among the signatories are the President of the 'National Ummah Party,' Fadlallah Burman Nasser, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces, Abdel Rahman Duklu, and the Deputy Chairman of the Popular Movement, Joseph Tuku. Also signing were former member of the Sovereignty Council, Mohamed Hassan Al-Tayashi, representing independent figures, and Alaa Al-Din Nada, representing the Trade Union and Professional Confederation, in addition to the representative of the opposition Conference of the 'Baja,' Osama Said, and the representative of the 'Free Blacks' Party, Mubarak Suleiman, and the Chairman of the 'Sudan Liberation Movement - Second Revolution,' Abu Al-Qasim Imam. The charter calls for the establishment of 'a secular, democratic, decentralized state based on freedom, equality, and justice, and not biased towards any cultural, ethnic, religious, or regional identity.' The charter talks about establishing 'a new, unified, professional, and national army with a new military ideology that reflects the diversity and multiplicity of the Sudanese state.' According to the charter, the parallel government aims to end the war, ensure the flow of humanitarian aid without obstacles, and maintain Sudan's unity. Since April 2023, the war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands and the displacement of over 12 million people, leading to the world's largest humanitarian crisis. The signing of the charter was delayed several times before it was finally held in Nairobi behind closed doors. Before months, disagreements emerged within 'the Progress Coalition,' which included some armed factions and political forces, leading to splits and some factions taking a clear stance on forming a parallel government in areas controlled by the Rapid Support Forces. It is worth noting that the leader of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemeti), was absent from the signing ceremony, with his brother Abdel Rahman Dagalo representing him.

**African Union Rejects Creation of Parallel Government in Sudan**
The African Union (UA) has expressed 'deep concern and strongly condemned the recent developments in Sudan, particularly the announcement by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and its affiliated political and social forces of the establishment of a parallel government in the Republic of Sudan, and warned that such action poses a huge risk of dividing the country', said the Addis Ababa-based organization in a statement after a virtual meeting on Tuesday. The UA issued the statement after the RSF and 23 other political and military groups reached a basic agreement in Nairobi on February 23 to form a parallel government, before signing a Transition Constitution for the country on March 4. The representatives of the involved groups emphasized at a press conference in the Kenyan capital on the same day that they would seek international recognition, although Hasbelnabi Mahmoud Hasbelnabi, leader of the Sudanese Democratic Liberation Movement (SDLM), assured EFE news agency at the time that these contacts had not yet been made. The CPS 'urged all member states of the UA and the international community not to recognize any parallel government or entity that seeks to divide and govern any part of the territory of the Republic of Sudan or its institutions' and not to support them. The council 'reaffirmed its commitment to preserving the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Republic of Sudan, as well as to resolving the current and devastating conflict peacefully'. The RSF and its allies plan to have the new parallel government based in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and not in the Darfur (west) or Cordofan (center) regions, as was speculated, as these territories are under paramilitary control. The proposed Constitution also provides that the army will be controlled by the rebels and will become a 'pluralistic' institution to integrate all ethnic groups in Sudan, among other measures. In addition to the RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (also known as Hemedti), and the SDLM, signatories to the pact include the National Umma Party, the Sudanese Liberation Movement of the North, the Sudanese Movement for Justice and Equality, and the Revolutionary Front Alliance, among others. The signing of the new Constitution took place at a time when the RSF have been losing territory to the army, especially in the states of Khartoum, Al Jazira, White Nile, and Northern Cordofan, adjacent to the Darfur region, where the paramilitaries maintain control of most of the area. The war in Sudan has caused tens of thousands of deaths and forced over 12 million people to flee their homes, more than 3 million of whom have been displaced to other countries, making the country the scene of the worst displacement crisis in the world, according to the UN.

**UN Security Council Expresses 'Deep Concern' Over Sudan's Parallel Government**
The United Nations Security Council has expressed its 'deep concern' over the announcement of a parallel government by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan, which ratified a transition constitution on Wednesday, warning of a possible fragmentation of the territory and a worsening of the situation. The 15 countries of the organization have warned in a statement that the establishment of a parallel authority in the African country 'risks exacerbating the ongoing conflict, fragmenting the country, and worsening a already grave humanitarian situation.' They have also described the measure as a 'threat to stability' in Sudan and the region as a whole, considering that it 'undermines' the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the African country. The Security Council has called on 'all' states to 'refrain from any external interference that seeks to promote conflict and instability,' after the signing of the document took place in Nairobi, Kenya, and amid criticism from Sudanese authorities towards this country for hosting meetings between the RSF and their allies. In contrast, the group of countries has again requested that 'all' parties in conflict comply with their commitments adopted in the Yeda Declaration, emphasizing the need for 'genuine, inclusive, and transparent dialogue that leads to a freely, justly, and democratically elected national government' that responds to the aspirations of the Sudanese people. Additionally, they have joined the call of the African Union and UN Secretary-General António Guterres to declare 'urgently' a ceasefire for the Ramadan holidays.

**Sudan's War Enters 23rd Month: A Call for Democratic Government and Peace**
The war in Sudan has entered its 23rd month, with the threat of the country's division and war crimes committed by both parties. The recent rapid support in Kutina and the targeting of electricity stations, such as 'Am Dabaker' in the Nile, have exacerbated the situation. The deteriorating living, economic, and health conditions, as well as the significant increases in prices and taxes to fund the war, have been widely rejected. Additionally, the continued brutal suppression of peaceful movements, such as the sit-in of railway workers in Port Sudan, has further complicated the situation. The formation of the parallel government, which has led to the split in the 'Progress' alliance, resulting in the formation of the 'Steadfastness' wing, is expected to be officially announced within a week or more. The 'constitutional framework' of the new authority includes three levels of governance: the Council of Sovereignty, the Council of Ministers as the executive authority, and the Parliament. The Sudanese government, backed by the army, is seeking to strengthen its relations with Iran and Russia, which will lead to further escalation and make Sudan a target for international and regional conflicts over resources, as well as external intervention to arm the warring parties and prolong the conflict. Furthermore, the increasing regional and international intervention in Sudan's affairs, as seen in the announcement of the Russian naval base, will lead to further escalation in the region and Sudan. Regarding resources, the recent conference in Addis Ababa, convened by the UAE, has been rejected by the de facto government and the African Union. The article emphasizes the importance of exiting the current policies, which are leading to the reproduction of the crisis and war, and instead calls for the establishment of a democratic and civilian government, and the achievement of peace and a comprehensive and just solution. The article outlines a set of measures to achieve this, including stopping the war, restoring the revolution's path, and providing humanitarian aid, as well as improving living conditions, reducing prices, and supporting essential goods and services. The article also calls for the withdrawal of the army and rapid support from politics and the economy, as well as reducing military and defense expenditures and increasing the budget for education, health, and development. The article emphasizes the importance of holding war criminals accountable, repealing restrictive laws, and establishing a democratic law for trade unions, as well as reforming the legal and judicial system and establishing a national police force. The article also calls for the dissolution of all militias and the disarmament of the population, as well as the establishment of a national army and the restoration of stolen assets. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of achieving peace, democracy, and justice, and the need to hold a constitutional conference at the end of the transitional period to determine the form of government, the identity of the country, and its relationship with religion, among other things.

**Sudanese Foreign Minister Informs African Union of Army's Control Over the Country**
The Sudanese Foreign Minister, Ali Youssef al-Sharif, sent a letter to the African Union's member states' foreign ministers, ahead of the council's meeting scheduled for today in Addis Ababa. In the letter, he informed the union that 'the Sudanese army and the forces allied with it have established control' over the country. The letter, carried by the Sudan News Agency last night, stated that 'the Sudanese armed forces and the joint forces representing the signatory movements to the Juba Agreement have confronted the Rapid Support Forces' attack and successfully established control over the country's territories.' The letter stated that 'the roadmap announced by the Transitional Sovereignty Council's Chairman, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, after extensive consultations with political and community forces, is a vision for the post-war phase,' explaining that details about the roadmap have been presented. The letter called on the African Union to 'reconsider its assessment of the situation in Sudan in light of the latest developments' and requested that 'Sudan be returned to its natural place in the organization and resume its role in African work.' The African Union suspended Sudan's membership in 2021 after the Transitional Sovereignty Council took control of the government after the ousting of former President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The summit will also witness the election of new members for the leadership of the union, amidst the challenges facing many countries in Africa. The elections include the selection of a new president for the African Union Commission, a deputy, and six members, in addition to the election of new members for the African Peace and Security Council. The summit will also discuss several key issues, including the reports of the African Peace and Security Council, institutional reforms for the union, and developments in the continental free trade area project.

**Egypt and Sudan Escalate Opposition to Nile River Basin Agreement - Warsheekh**
Egypt and Sudan have escalated their opposition to the Nile River Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA), citing concerns that it endangers the region's fragile equilibrium. The two countries believe the CFA's enactment threatens their long-standing water rights established under the colonial-era 1929 and 1959 Nile River Agreements. Egypt's President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi emphasized that water security is Egypt's foremost concern, as the Nile provides 98% of the country's water resources. The CFA's ratification by six upstream nations has intensified regional tensions, with Egypt and Sudan advocating for a more inclusive framework that deters unilateral decisions by upstream nations. 'The six-nation commission under the incomplete CFA cannot represent the interests of the entire Nile Basin,' the joint statement declared. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed praised the ratification of the CFA as a landmark move toward a fairer distribution of the Nile's resources, but his remarks have done little to alleviate the concerns of downstream nations. The broader geopolitical effects of the Nile dispute are also becoming more apparent, with Egypt increasing its military presence in Somalia to counter Ethiopia's influence in the region.

**Georges Olemanu's Skepticism about the African Continental Free Trade Area**
Georges Olemanu, a Master's degree candidate at China Foreign Affairs University, expressed skepticism about the African Continental Free Trade Area (ZLEC) agreement signed at the Kigali Summit in 2018. He believes that the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will have more to lose than gain from the common market. Olemanu stated, 'The philosophy of building a united Africa, as envisioned by Nkrumah, is a dream that has been materializing since 1963, with the creation of the Organisation of African Unity (OUA). However, I am skeptical about the declarations of certain authorities from emerging economies and the absence of the Nigerian President at the summit.' He noted that African countries have a low level of intra-regional trade, with only 16% of trade occurring within the continent, compared to 50% among Asian countries and 70% among Europeans. Olemanu warned that the DRC's vulnerability in the face of emerging African economies, such as South Africa, Egypt, and Kenya, is a permanent danger. He emphasized the need for the DRC to industrialize its economy and produce in large quantities to benefit from the system. He also expressed concerns about the potential risks of a fragile security situation in the DRC, which could be exacerbated by the removal of economic borders within the ZLEC.

Forecaster_1 step 1 output:
Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

The available sources provide limited direct information about Sudan's AfCFTA ratification status:

- **The Star (April 2025)**: Discusses **South Sudan** (not Sudan), with their Trade Minister reaffirming commitment to AfCFTA ratification. This source is not relevant to the question since South Sudan and Sudan are different countries. The source appears credible but addresses the wrong country.

- **The EastAfrican (March 2025)**: Provides factual UN Economic Commission for Africa data showing that as of January 2025, 54 African countries had signed AfCFTA (all except Eritrea) and 48 had ratified, leaving 6 countries that signed but haven't ratified. This is factual information from a credible regional business publication citing UN data.

- **AU Article (2019)**: Historical context about AfCFTA's operational launch, noting 27 ratifications at that time. Factual but dated information from the official African Union source.

- **First source and Perplexity report**: No usable content extracted.

The sources lack specific information about Sudan's current ratification status or any active ratification process.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

Possible reference classes:
1. **African countries that signed but haven't ratified AfCFTA** (6 countries as of January 2025)
2. **Countries ratifying international trade agreements under short deadlines**
3. **Sudan's historical pattern of ratifying international agreements**
4. **Countries facing political instability ratifying complex trade agreements**

The most suitable reference class is African countries that have signed but not ratified AfCFTA, combined with the constraint of countries attempting ratification under severe time pressure during political instability.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

- **Prediction timeframe**: 25 days (June 6 to July 1, 2025)
- **Historical patterns**: International trade agreement ratifications typically require:
  - Parliamentary/legislative approval processes
  - Technical reviews and consultations
  - Domestic legal preparations
  - These processes usually take months, not weeks

The 25-day timeframe is extraordinarily short for ratification procedures, especially for a country experiencing ongoing political and economic challenges.

**(d) Justification:**

Several factors strongly suggest a low probability:

1. **Severe time constraint**: 25 days is insufficient for typical ratification procedures, which involve parliamentary processes, technical reviews, and domestic preparations.

2. **Sudan's current situation**: The country faces ongoing political instability, armed conflict, and economic challenges that would complicate rapid legislative action on international agreements.

3. **Lack of evidence**: No sources indicate Sudan has initiated or is actively pursuing AfCFTA ratification, suggesting the process hasn't begun.

4. **Procedural complexity**: AfCFTA ratification involves complex domestic legal and administrative preparations that cannot be rushed.

5. **Reference class precedent**: Among the 6 countries that had signed but not ratified by January 2025, none appear to have completed ratification in the subsequent months, suggesting systemic challenges.

Outside view calibration:

Considering the base rate of countries completing complex international agreement ratifications within 25 days during periods of political instability, this appears to be an extremely rare occurrence. The combination of Sudan's current challenges, the procedural requirements for ratification, and the absence of any evidence of active ratification efforts suggests a probability in the low single digits.

The lack of any reported ratification activity, combined with the severe time constraint and Sudan's ongoing instability, points to a probability around 2-4%. This accounts for the small possibility of emergency parliamentary sessions or expedited procedures, while recognizing that such scenarios are highly unlikely given current circumstances.

Outside View Prediction:
3%

Forecaster_2 step 1 output:
Analysis:

**(a) Source analysis:**
The available sources provide limited direct information about Sudan's AfCFTA ratification status:

- **No direct Sudan information**: The initial query returned no usable content about Sudan specifically.
- **South Sudan confusion**: The Star article discusses South Sudan (not Sudan) reaffirming commitment to join AfCFTA, but these are separate countries since 2011.
- **Aggregate data**: The EastAfrican (March 2025) provides the most relevant factual information: as of January 2025, 54 countries had signed AfCFTA (all AU members except Eritrea) and 48 had ratified, leaving 6 signatories that hadn't yet ratified.
- **Historical context**: The AU article from 2019 provides background on AfCFTA's launch but no current ratification data.
- **Failed search**: The Perplexity query for detailed Sudan-specific information failed.

The most reliable factual data comes from the UN Economic Commission for Africa statistics reported in The EastAfrican, showing the 48/54 ratification rate as of January 2025.

**(b) Reference class analysis:**
Several reference classes are possible:
1. **African countries that signed but haven't ratified AfCFTA** - Most relevant, as this directly describes Sudan's likely status
2. **Countries ratifying trade agreements under political instability** - Relevant given Sudan's ongoing challenges
3. **Sudan's historical international agreement ratification patterns** - Would be ideal but data unavailable

The first reference class is most suitable: of 54 signatories, 6 remained unratified as of January 2025, suggesting these are likely the more challenging cases with political or economic obstacles.

**(c) Timeframe analysis:**
The prediction timeframe is extremely short: approximately 25 days from June 6 to July 1, 2025. This is critical because ratification typically requires:
- Parliamentary/legislative approval
- Executive approval and signature
- Formal deposit of ratification instruments with the AU

Historical patterns show that treaty ratification processes usually take months, not weeks, especially for countries facing political instability.

**(d) Justification:**
Several factors point toward a low probability:
- **Short timeframe**: 25 days is insufficient for typical ratification processes
- **Sudan's political challenges**: Ongoing instability since 2019, including military coups and civil conflicts, would complicate legislative processes
- **Reference class position**: Sudan appears to be among the 6 "difficult" cases that hadn't ratified despite signing
- **Process complexity**: AfCFTA ratification involves significant domestic legal and economic considerations

However, some factors support possibility:
- **High overall ratification rate**: 89% of signatories had ratified by January 2025
- **Economic incentives**: AfCFTA offers significant trade benefits
- **Possible ongoing process**: Ratification procedures might already be underway

Outside view calibration:

I'm anchoring to the 89% ratification rate among AfCFTA signatories, but adjusting heavily downward for the extremely short timeframe and Sudan's specific challenges. The 25-day constraint is particularly severe - even if Sudan had strong political will, completing ratification procedures in under a month would be extremely difficult.

The reference class of 6 remaining non-ratifying signatories suggests these are countries with significant obstacles. For one of these countries to complete ratification in the final 25 days of the deadline represents a very low probability event.

I'm calibrating toward the lower end while maintaining some probability for the scenario where ratification processes were already advanced but not yet publicly announced.

Outside View Prediction:
12%

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
1. The Star (April 13, 2025) on South Sudan’s AfCFTA push  
  – Facts: South Sudan’s trade minister reaffirmed commitment to join/benefit from AfCFTA; roadmap and policy dialogues announced.  
  – Opinions: Statements by Minister Manyang on urgency are his normative view, not binding policy steps.  
  – Quality: Established Kenyan daily; reliable for event reporting, but focused on South Sudan, not Sudan.  

2. The EastAfrican (March 22, 2025) summarizing UNECA/ECA study  
  – Facts: As of January 2025, 54 signatories and 48 ratifications; tariff-revenue losses quantified; long-term gains projected.  
  – Opinions: UNECA economists’ views on net welfare gains—expert but projection based.  
  – Quality: Reputable regional business weekly, citing official ECA report.  

3. African Union press release on AfCFTA operational phase (July 2019)  
  – Facts: Entry-into-force date, number of initial ratifications (27), rules of origin, tariff-liberalization schedule.  
  – Opinions: None—official summary of summit outcomes.  
  – Quality: Primary source from AU; authoritative on institutional milestones.  

4. Perplexity API attempt to get Sudan ratification history failed—no additional data.  

Conclusion on sources: We have strong baseline data on signatory vs. ratifier counts; near-term ratification pipeline is opaque. No direct Sudan ratification steps documented in our sources.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Potential reference classes:  
 1. All AfCFTA signatories’ ratification behavior (54 countries). 48/54 (89%) ratified by Jan 2025—over ~4½ years.  
 2. Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) among signatories (≈25). If 4–6 LDCs remain holdouts, ~80–84% of LDCs eventually ratified by Jan 2025.  
 3. Politically unstable countries ratifying major treaties (e.g., post-coup or post-conflict states). Attrition stronger, slower ratification.  

Suitability: Class (1) gives broadest base rate but masks heterogeneity. Class (3) best captures Sudan’s political instability (“transition” collapse, no legislative council).  

c) Timeframe analysis  
– Today is 2025-06-06; deadline is 2025-07-01 → 25 days left (≈0.07 years).  
– Of 48 ratifications by Jan 2025, very few occurred in the final month before target dates; ratification tends to occur in multimonth blocs aligning with legislative sessions.  
– Sudan’s absence of a functioning legislature and high political uncertainty suggest ratification is unlikely to be expedited in a 3½-week window.  

d) Justification  
Out of 54 AfCFTA signatories, 89% have ratified over ~4.5 years, leaving 6 holdouts. If ratification were uniformly likely over time, the chance of any one country ratifying in a given 25-day window would be low (<2%). However, ratifications tend to cluster as deadlines near; still, Sudan is a special case:  
 – No record of parliamentary or executive deposit action.  
 – No major summit or legislative session scheduled before July 1.  
 – Political instability (coups, lack of legislative body) weighs heavily against rapid ratification.  

Combining the broad reference class (89% eventual ratification) with Sudan’s atypical delays and limited time, we down-weight sharply. A generous “last-minute push” might give holdouts a 5–15% chance; Sudan’s specific constraints suggest we tilt to the lower end of that range.

Outside view calibration:  
– Broad base-rate of eventual ratification: ~89% over 4½ years.  
– Time-compressed to next 25 days: scale by ~0.07/4.5 ≈1.5%, but raise to account for end-spurt clustering: ×5–10 → ≈7–15%.  
– Further adjust downward for Sudan’s political/legislative paralysis: factor ≈0.7 → 5–10%.  

I assign ≈9% as my outside-view probability that Sudan can complete ratification paperwork (legislative approval + deposit instrument) in the next 25 days.

Outside View Prediction: 9% confidence that Sudan will ratify AfCFTA before July 1, 2025.

Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
  a. “World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan” (The Star, 13 April 2025)  
    • Summary: South Sudan reaffirmed its urgent commitment to AfCFTA ratification, with a roadmap for trade facilitation.  
    • Quality/reliability: Credible journalism quoting government officials; factual on South Sudan but not about Sudan.  
    • Relevance: Illustrates a fellow post‐conflict state’s rhetoric vs. action gap; suggests that verbal commitment does not guarantee imminent ratification.  

  b. “EA faces $160 m forfeiture in tax revenues under AfCFTA” (The EastAfrican, 22 March 2025)  
    • Summary: UNECA study quantifies tariff‐revenue losses/gains, reports that as of January 2025 there were 54 signatories and 48 ratifications.  
    • Quality/reliability: UNECA data are authoritative; EastAfrican coverage is standard regional‐business reporting.  
    • Facts vs. opinions: The tariff‐revenue figures are factual; longer‐term welfare benefits are projections/opinions from UNECA economists.  
    • Relevance: The “48/54” ratification statistic gives our base rate for how many signatories have followed through.  

  c. “Operational Phase Of The AfCFTA Launched” (AU, 7 July 2019)  
    • Summary: Adoption dates, entry‐into‐force milestones, operational instruments, and institutional arrangements.  
    • Quality/reliability: Official AU communique—highly reliable for process/timeline.  
    • Relevance: Contextualizes when and how ratification became actionable; does not cover Sudan specifically.  

  d. Perplexity Report Error  
    • Summary: Attempted to retrieve detailed Sudan data but failed.  
    • Relevance: Leaves a gap in our knowledge of Sudan’s internal ratification steps.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
  Possible reference classes:  
  1) All AfCFTA signatories (excluding Eritrea) and their ratification behavior.  
  2) Countries experiencing major political unrest/transitions post‐2019 and their speed of AfCFTA ratification (e.g., Libya, South Sudan).  
  3) Least Developed Countries in civil‐military transition.  

  Evaluation:  
  – Class (1) gives a broad 89% (48/54) ratification rate by Jan 2025 but lumps in stable and unstable regimes.  
  – Class (2) isolates countries with similar turmoil; among them, ratification has been slow or remains uncompleted even after summit commitments.  
  Conclusion: Combine (1) and (2): use the overall base rate (89%) but discount heavily for Sudan’s ongoing transitional‐military government and recent 2023 coup, putting it in the same bucket as other hold‐outs.

3. Timeframe analysis  
  – Today is 6 June 2025; cutoff is 1 July 2025: ~25 days remain.  
  – Historically, ratifications surged soon after entry into force (mid-2019 through early-2021) then tapered; only a handful of “late adopters” have ratified since.  
  – No data suggest a late-June flurry of deposit instruments—Au Secretariat publish regular lists, and the Jan 2025 tally shows six outstanding, none of which are close to deposit.  

4. Additional considerations  
  – Sudan’s political environment: fractured civilian–military arrangements, competing priorities (security, humanitarian crisis), limited capacity for domestic legislative action.  
  – No high‐level Sudanese pledge in 2025; regional summit coverage (e.g., Nairobi for South Sudan) mentions neighbors but omits Sudan.  
  – Expert expectation: UNECA emphasizes an adjustment fund for vulnerable states, but Sudan has neither requested nor been spotlighted as a beneficiary—suggesting it is not on the cusp of ratification.  

Justification for outside view prediction  
  – Base‐rate anchor: 48/54 ≈ 89% for signatories overall → but these include stable countries that ratified quickly.  
  – We re‐weight downward for the “late‐adopters” cohort (the six hold‐outs): within that group, historical ratification rate from Jan 2025 to cutoff has been near zero.  
  – Political‐instability adjustment: other conflict‐ridden states (South Sudan, Libya) have shown commitment but no deposit.  
  – Time‐pressure discount: ~25 days left—domestic parliamentary procedures (committee review, floor votes, executive signature, deposit) require more time than seems available.  

Outside view calibration  
  – If all 54 had equal chances by Jan 2025, each would have 89% by now; but the six hold‐outs have demonstrably lower probability—likely in single digits.  
  – Given the precedent of zero or near‐zero ratifications among hold‐outs in the last 6 months, plus Sudan’s internal obstacles and the short time left, we assign a small chance.  
  – We calibrate to balance the possibility of a surprise last‐minute executive‐decree deposit against the near‐zero historical pace.  

Outside View Prediction  
Sudan has about a 8% probability of ratifying the AfCFTA before 1 July 2025.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• The-Star (13 Apr 2025) – News story on South Sudan’s trade minister pledging to “urgently” ratify AfCFTA. Factual elements: venue, speakers, numbers of delegates. Contains forward-looking statements that are the minister’s opinions. Not about the Republic of Sudan, hence only tangentially useful as a regional comparator. Source quality: mid-tier Kenyan newspaper; generally reliable on dates/quotes, limited on broader regional politics.  
• The EastAfrican (22 Mar 2025) – Regional business weekly summarising a UNECA report. Hard data: 48 AfCFTA ratifications as of Jan 2025; 54 signatories; Eritrea the sole non-signatory. Loss-of-tariff figures are modelled estimates (expert opinion from UNECA). High-quality factual content about the aggregate ratification count; no country-specific detail for Sudan.  
• AU press release (7 Jul 2019) – Primary source on AfCFTA launch. Confirms entry-into-force mechanics, but predates the forecasting window. Useful only for establishing that ratification requires depositing an instrument with the AU.  
• Perplexity report – Failed; provides no data.  

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Potential classes:  
1. All AU member states that signed AfCFTA but had not ratified 6 years after signature.  
2. All AU member states experiencing armed conflict while deliberating AfCFTA ratification.  
3. Any multilateral trade agreement ratification by a fragile/transition government worldwide (e.g., WTO accessions of post-conflict states).  
Class 1 is the broadest and has hard numbers (6 hold-outs out of 54 by Jan 2025). Class 2 would be narrower but data are sparse and definitions of “armed conflict” differ. Class 3 is much harder to quantify. For a first-pass outside view I adopt Class 1, then crudely adjust for elapsed time.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 6 Jun 2025. Deadline: 1 Jul 2025 → 25 days.  
Empirical rhythm:  
• By mid-2021 ≈ 30+ ratifications.  
• By mid-2023 ≈ 44.  
• 2024 added one (48 total by Jan 2025).  
So the annual flow has slowed to roughly one ratification per calendar year among a shrinking pool of hold-outs.  
Assuming a Poisson-like arrival rate of ≈ 1 ratification/year across 6 countries, the per-country annual hazard ≈ 1/6 ≈ 17 %.  
Scaling linearly, the 25-day (≈ 0.07 yr) hazard ≈ 17 % × 0.07 ≈ 1.2 %.

(d) Justification  
• The headline base rate—1 ratification in the previous 12 months from a set of 6—already implies low odds for any specific country.  
• No public evidence of Sudan advancing the domestic legal steps (parliamentary approval, deposit at AU) appears in any of the sources or in recent newswire traffic.  
• Sudan has been engulfed in a large-scale armed conflict since April 2023; no functioning national legislature has sat for over a year, and rival military factions claim executive authority. Comparable states embroiled in civil war seldom pass and deposit international economic treaties within weeks.  
• Key AfCFTA ratifications tend to be announced at AU Summits (Feb or Jul), but the next Summit occurs after the 1 July cut-off.  
• Therefore, even before factoring the “inside view” of Sudan’s civil-war paralysis, the outside view already yields ≈ 1 % odds over 25 days.  

Outside view calibration:
Baseline hazard per hold-out country ≈ 17 % per year (derived from 1 ratification/6 hold-outs/year).  
Linear time-scaling to 25 days: 17 % × 25⁄365 ≈ 1.2 %.  
We round slightly upward (because AU summits sometimes bunch ratifications, and 1 July is close to the AU’s July summit window) but remain in the 1-2 % band.  
Hence an outside-view probability of 1 %–2 % seems warranted before any Sudan-specific information is applied.

Outside View Prediction:
1 %

Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**TRALAC update (March 5, 2024)**: Written by Gerhard Erasmus, founder of Trade Law Centre, who has advised governments and regional bodies. Shows Sudan as one of 8 non-state parties that haven't ratified AfCFTA and haven't submitted Provisional Schedules of Tariff Concessions. High credibility expert source providing factual status.

**fDi Intelligence (June 5, 2024)**: Business intelligence publication confirming Sudan among 7 signatories remaining as non-state parties. Credible financial publication with factual data.

**Ddcustomslaw (June 6, 2025)**: Most recent source showing Sudan among 8 AU Member States that haven't ratified and among 8 states yet to submit PSTCs. Appears to be legal/customs specialist publication with current factual information.

**TheAfricaReport (June 13, 2024)**: Shows 43 countries deposited ratification instruments, mentions "stakeholders recently reviewed a draft strategy under IGAD facilitation" for Sudan. Credible African news source noting some preparatory activity but no ratification.

**AskNews articles**: Multiple recent articles focus on Sudan's ongoing armed conflict, humanitarian crises, and political instability. No articles mention AfCFTA ratification activities. These provide crucial context about Sudan's current capacity constraints.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong evidence:**
- Multiple independent sources confirm Sudan has not ratified AfCFTA as of June 2025
- Sudan has not submitted prerequisite Provisional Schedules of Tariff Concessions
- Ongoing armed conflict between army and Rapid Support Forces severely constrains government capacity
- No evidence of active parliamentary or government ratification proceedings

**Moderate evidence:**
- Draft implementation strategy being reviewed suggests some preparatory work but not active ratification process
- Historical patterns show trade agreement ratifications require months, not weeks

**Weak evidence:**
- The 25-day timeframe allows theoretical possibility of emergency legislative procedures

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

Prediction timeframe: 25 days (June 6 to July 1, 2025). If doubled to 50 days, probability might increase to 5-8% allowing more time for expedited procedures. If halved to 12-13 days, probability would approach zero as insufficient time for any meaningful legislative process.

**(d) Justification:**

Current circumstances are significantly more constraining than the outside view reference class:

1. **Prerequisite gap**: Sudan hasn't completed basic requirements (PSTC submission), indicating the ratification process hasn't meaningfully begun
2. **Active conflict**: The ongoing armed conflict creates extraordinary constraints on government capacity that go beyond typical political instability
3. **Time constraint**: 25 days is insufficient for ratification procedures even under normal circumstances
4. **No active process**: Complete absence of evidence for any current ratification activities in parliament or government

These factors compound to create circumstances far more restrictive than the historical reference class of countries ratifying trade agreements under time pressure.

**Probability Calibration:**

The current evidence strongly reinforces the low outside view prediction. The ongoing armed conflict, lack of prerequisite completion, absence of active ratification proceedings, and extreme time constraint create nearly insurmountable barriers. The combination of structural constraints (conflict, institutional capacity) with procedural requirements (parliamentary processes, technical preparations) in a 25-day window makes ratification extremely unlikely.

While maintaining small probability for unforeseen emergency procedures, the evidence weighs heavily toward non-occurrence.

**Checklist:**
1. Sudan ratifies AfCFTA before July 1, 2025 (25 days) - aligned with resolution criteria
2. Outside view: 3% for trade agreement ratification under severe time pressure during instability 
3. 2 out of 100 times, Sudan ratifies AfCFTA in 25 days during armed conflict - this aligns with structural constraints
4. Key evidence: No ratification as of June 2025, ongoing armed conflict, no PSTC submitted, no active proceedings, 25-day timeframe insufficient
5. Blind spot: Emergency session with international pressure could expedite process, but conflict constraints remain severe
6. Status quo: Non-ratification is highly likely to continue given current circumstances

**Probability: 2%**
Predicted Probability: 2.0%

**(a) Source analysis:**

**Expert/Authoritative Sources:**
- Gerhard Erasmus (TRALAC founder, March 2024): High-quality expert analysis confirming Sudan among 8 non-ratifying states and hasn't submitted required tariff schedules
- Wamkele Mene (AfCFTA Secretary-General, June 2024): Authoritative source noting 43 countries have ratified, mentions Sudan stakeholders reviewed draft strategy under IGAD facilitation
- Multiple legal/trade publications (2024-2025): Consistent documentation that Sudan remains among non-ratifying holdouts

**News Sources:**
- Recent Asknews articles (June 2025): Focus on Sudan's ongoing civil war, parallel government formation by RSF, humanitarian convoy attacks, AU concerns about territorial fragmentation

**Key Factual Information vs. Opinions:**
- Facts: Sudan has not ratified AfCFTA, has not submitted tariff schedules, is in active civil war since April 2023, AU membership suspended since 2021
- Expert opinion: Mene's cautious timeline projections and mention of ongoing stakeholder consultations suggest institutional processes continue despite conflict

**(b) Evidence analysis:**

**Strong evidence against ratification:**
- Multiple independent sources confirm Sudan's non-ratification status across 2024-2025
- Active civil war between Sudanese army and Rapid Support Forces since April 2023
- Formation of parallel government by opposition forces (March 2025), rejected by AU and UN Security Council
- Sudan's AU membership suspended since 2021 military coup
- No functioning legislature to approve ratification

**Moderate evidence:**
- Recent stakeholder consultations under IGAD facilitation suggest some institutional continuity
- Historical pattern shows 47/54 African countries eventually ratified

**Weak evidence:**
- No recent government statements about imminent ratification plans
- Extremely compressed 25-day timeframe for complex treaty ratification process

**(c) Timeframe analysis:**

Prediction timeframe: 25 days (June 6 - July 1, 2025). This requires Sudan to complete domestic legislative approval and deposit ratification instruments while managing active civil conflict.

If timeframe was halved (12 days): Probability would approach zero
If timeframe was doubled (50 days): Slight increase possible but structural impediments remain dominant

**(d) Justification:**

The outside view 9% probability assumed typical African country ratification patterns. However, current circumstances reveal Sudan faces structural impediments far beyond normal "holdout" countries:

1. **Active warfare**: Civil war since April 2023 with ongoing fighting, humanitarian crises
2. **Governance collapse**: No functioning legislature, parallel government formation
3. **International isolation**: AU membership suspension, international concern about territorial fragmentation  
4. **Incomplete groundwork**: Haven't submitted basic required tariff schedules
5. **Extreme time pressure**: 25 days insufficient for complex treaty ratification under normal circumstances

These factors represent categorical differences from the reference class, making Sudan's situation analogous to failed states rather than stable countries with delayed ratification decisions.

The only positive signal—stakeholder consultations under IGAD—indicates institutional processes exist but falls far short of imminent ratification capability.

**Probability calibration:**

The severe structural impediments—active civil war, governance collapse, international isolation—create categorical differences from the 9% outside view base rate. While some institutional processes continue (IGAD consultations), the 25-day timeframe combined with lack of functioning legislature makes ratification extremely unlikely. The most plausible scenario requires simultaneous ceasefire, emergency legislative procedures, and prioritization of AfCFTA ratification—all highly improbable given current conflict dynamics.

**Checklist:**
1. Sudan must ratify AfCFTA before July 1, 2025 (25 days remaining)
2. Outside view: 9% based on African ratification patterns, but current circumstances are categorically different
3. Consistency: 2 out of 100 times, Sudan completes ratification during active civil war in 25 days
4. Key evidence: Active civil war, no legislature, AU suspension, missing tariff schedules, 25-day deadline
5. Blind spot: Sudden comprehensive peace agreement enabling emergency ratification procedures
6. Status quo: War continues, institutional paralysis persists, no ratification occurs

Analysis:
1. Paraphrase  
Will Sudan deposit its instrument of ratification for the African Continental Free Trade Area before 1 July 2025? It must complete signature→parliamentary approval→deposit in the next 25 days.

2. Source analysis  
• Trade Law Centre (TRALAC) March 2024: Sudan one of eight signatories not yet ratified. (Reliable NGO trade adviser.)  
• fDi Intelligence June 2024: Confirms Sudan among seven non-state parties. (Reputable data source.)  
• ddcustomslaw June 6 2025: Lists Sudan among eight states yet to submit tariff schedules or ratify. (Legal-specialist blog, timely.)  
• TheAfricaReport June 2024: Background on AfCFTA phases; no sign Sudan has advanced ratification. (Expert interview.)  
• Asknews articles (Jun 2025): No mention of Sudan’s AfCFTA ratification—coverage focuses on conflict, not trade.  

3. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• ddcustomslaw June 6 2025 (latest): Sudan still hasn’t ratified.  
• Historical reference class: Of 54 signatories, 48 ratified over ~6 years; remaining six are the hardest cases.  

Moderate evidence  
• Conflict in Sudan → legislative paralysis.  
• usual ratification timeline (months) vs. 25-day window.  

Weak evidence  
• General push by IGAD/former president champions, but no formal announcements.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
Only ~25 days remain. Even an expedited process in stable countries takes months. Halving to ~12 days makes ratification virtually impossible (<1%). Doubling to ~50 days might raise probability modestly to ~10%, but Sudan’s instability and lack of preparatory steps keep odds low.

5. Justification  
Base rate: 89% of signatories ratified over years; Sudan is in the bottom 11%.  
Adjustment for current factors:  
• +0%: No indication Sudan has begun formal deposit or published ratification bill.  
• −7%: Extremely short runway and active civil-military conflict hinder parliamentary action.  
Result: 12% – 7% ≈ 5%.

Probability calibration  
Given the strong, recent evidence that Sudan remains unratified as of June 6 and the impractically short time to complete internal and AU procedures amid conflict, I assign a low, but not zero, probability.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Correct.  
2. Base rate: 89% among signatories, aligned.  
3. Consistency: 5 times in 100, Sudan manages this last-minute ratification.  
4. Key evidence: Latest ratification status; 25-day window; conflict paralysis.  
5. Blind spot: Sudden political settlement and transitional government push to fast-track ratification.  
6. Status quo: Highly volatile; minor likelihood increases if peace deal emerges, but not yet.

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question  
   “Will Sudan deposit its ratification instrument for the AfCFTA by 1 July 2025?” (deadline in ~25 days).

2. Source analysis  
   a. TRALAC (Gerhard Erasmus, Mar 5 2024):  
      • Facts: 54 of 55 AU members signed; 47 ratified; Sudan among eight non-state parties; PSTC (tariff schedule) outstanding for Sudan.  
      • Quality: Highly reliable trade-law centre analysis. No opinion.  
   b. fDi Intelligence (June 5 2024):  
      • Facts: Seven signatories (including Sudan) remain non-state parties; procedural hurdles noted.  
      • Quality: Reputable business source citing UNECA. Facts vs. quoted expert opinions clearly distinguished.  
   c. Ddcustomslaw (June 6 2025):  
      • Facts: As of today, Sudan still has not submitted or had verified its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions; eight states still un-ratified.  
      • Quality: Specialist customs-law blog with up-to-date AU Secretariat data.  
   d. TheAfricaReport (June 13 2024):  
      • Facts: AfCFTA boss warns integration will take decades; notes Sudan stakeholders have reviewed a draft strategy but gives no timetable for ratification.  
      • Quality: Solid journalism quoting AfCFTA Secretariat; mixes facts with leadership’s strategic outlook.

3. Reference-class and outside view anchor  
   – Base rate: 47/54 ≈ 87% of signatories have ratified by mid-2025.  
   – But among the eight “late adopters” (Benin, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Eritrea), ratification pace from Jan 2025 to Jun 2025 is 0/8.  
   – Countries in active conflict or severe political transition (e.g. South Sudan, Libya) have not ratified in the final window. Sudan’s internal strife and AU suspension indicate low capacity.

4. Inside-view factors  
   a. Procedural steps still undone: Sudan has neither submitted a PSTC nor convened the necessary committee to draft domestic implementing legislation.  
   b. Political context: Ongoing war, parallel governments, humanitarian crisis; little sign of parliamentary bandwidth or executive priority for trade-law reform.  
   c. No high-level Sudanese pledge or roadmap publicly announced in H1 2025.  
   d. Other conflict-affected holdouts show no late-June rush; AU Secretariat updates indicate no deposit pipeline.

5. Timeframe analysis  
   – ~25 days until resolution. Typical ratification requires draft legislation, parliamentary approval, presidential signature, and deposit notification—each step normally takes weeks or months.  
   – If timeframe were doubled (≈50 days), probability might rise modestly (to perhaps 10–15%) if a push occurred. Halved (~12 days) would push probability toward zero.

6. Evidence weighting  
   Strong evidence (large downward shift):  
     • Ddcustomslaw (6 Jun 2025): Sudan still has not submitted PSTC or ratified.  
     • Historical patterns: zero holdouts ratified in last six months.  
   Moderate evidence (moderate shift):  
     • fDi Intelligence: procedural and political hurdles.  
     • TheAfricaReport: no Sudanese deadline announced.  
   Weak evidence (small shift):  
     • Anecdote of draft strategy review under IGAD.  

7. Justification of probability shift  
   – Anchor 87% ratification base rate but heavily discounted for cohort of holdouts (0% ratification in recent period).  
   – Political-instability adjustment: reduces near-term chance to single digits.  
   – Timing constraint: needed procedural steps and political will unlikely in 25 days.  
   Final inside-view probability: ~5%.

Probability calibration  
I predict that Sudan has a very small chance—around 5%—to complete and deposit its AfCFTA ratification instrument by 1 July 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase—OK.  
2. Base rate=87%, adjusted to 5% for holdouts and context.  
3. “5 out of 100 times, Sudan ratifies by 1 July 2025.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Sudan still hasn’t submitted PSTC (strong).  
   • Zero of eight holdouts ratified since Jan 2025 (strong).  
   • No public Sudanese ratification pledge in 2025 (moderate).  
   • Only ~25 days remain vs. months of legislative steps (strong).  
5. Blind spot—Surprise peace deal or executive emergency decree fast-tracking ratification.  
6. Status quo—likely no deposit before cutoff.

Predicted Probability: 5.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• TRALAC blog (Erasmus, Mar-24) – long-running trade-law think-tank; factual data on signatories/ratifications and tariff-schedule submissions. High reliability, low bias, still current.  
• fDi Intelligence (Jun-24) – FT affiliate; surveys AfCFTA hurdles and quotes specialists. Good reliability; lightly analytical.  
• DDCustomsLaw note (Jun-25) – customs consultancy summarising AU minutes; mostly factual, cites official numbers up to May-25. Medium reliability but internally consistent with TRALAC.  
• TheAfricaReport (Jun-24) – pan-African business magazine; interview with AfCFTA SG. Useful for institutional timelines; moderate reliability.  
• AskNews packet (Feb-25 – Jun-25) – a dozen wire items on Sudan war and AU reactions; mainstream outlets (Al-Jazeera, Anadolu, State Dept, AU communiqués). All confirm severe governance breakdown; no item mentions AfCFTA ratification progress. High reliability for conflict status, negative evidence for treaty movement.

Across 15+ recent sources, none report draft bills, cabinet approval or AU deposit by Sudan, while several explicitly list Sudan among the eight non-ratifiers as late as May-25.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong evidence  
• Structural: Sudan’s national legislature is non-functional and the state is in a two-year civil war (multiple mainstream wires, AU PSC communiqués). Hard to change in 25 days.  
• Institutional: AU suspended Sudan; parallel authorities contest legitimacy. A valid instrument of ratification must come from a government the AU Commission accepts.  
Moderate evidence  
• Historical rhythm: only one ratification among the six remaining signatories in the last 12 months ⇒ ≈17 % annual hazard per country.  
• Process precedent: other ratifiers have required cabinet + parliamentary endorsement plus AU deposit, typically many weeks; there is no sign Sudan has even begun.  
Weak evidence  
• Possibility that a warring faction might make a symbolic deposit to curry AU favour at the July summit.

Net effect: strong negative evidence outweighs any weak positive.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining to 1 Jul 2025: 25 days ≈0.07 yr. If the window were doubled to 50 days, probability rises only slightly (≈+0.5 pp) because next AU summit opens 2-3 July; if halved to 12 days, probability drops ~40 % proportionally.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (derived from 1 ratification per 6 hold-outs per year) gives ≈1.2 % for a random country over 25 days.  
Sudan-specific factors cut the odds roughly in half:  
• Governance collapse → very low capacity to pass a ratification bill (−40 %).  
• AU suspension and contested legitimacy make deposit acceptance doubtful (−30 %).  
• No preparatory steps (tariff schedule, PSTC) lodged (−20 %).  
Combined shrinkage (~50 – 60 %) moves the forecast to about 0.5 – 0.7 %.  
I round to 1 % to reflect residual tail risks (e.g., sudden political deal plus ceremonial deposit at month-end).

Probability calibration
My inside-view probability that Sudan will ratify AfCFTA before 1 July 2025 is 1 %.  
Interpretation: in 1 out of 100 comparable worlds, an accepted Sudanese instrument of ratification reaches the AU Commission within the next 25 days.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “By 1 Jul 2025 will Sudan deposit a valid AfCFTA ratification?”  
2. Base rate ≈1.2 %; final 1 % remains anchored.  
3. Consistency – “1 out of 100 times, Sudan ratifies in time.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) ongoing civil war & split authority; (ii) AU suspension; (iii) no legislative action reported; (iv) only 1 ratification among remaining six in last year.  
5. Blind-spot – Surprise unity deal at AU pre-summit with rapid procedural rubber-stamp. Would lift odds to ~10 %.  
6. Status-quo bias checked: status quo = no ratification; conflict makes change unlikely; slight nudge toward status quo applied.

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%

Only ~25 days remain. Even an expedited process in stable countries takes months. Halving to ~12 days makes ratification virtually impossible (<1%). Doubling to ~50 days might raise probability modestly to ~10%, but Sudan’s instability and lack of preparatory steps keep odds low.

5. Justification  
Base rate: 89% of signatories ratified over years; Sudan is in the bottom 11%.  
Adjustment for current factors:  
• +0%: No indication Sudan has begun formal deposit or published ratification bill.  
• −7%: Extremely short runway and active civil-military conflict hinder parliamentary action.  
Result: 12% – 7% ≈ 5%.

Probability calibration  
Given the strong, recent evidence that Sudan remains unratified as of June 6 and the impractically short time to complete internal and AU procedures amid conflict, I assign a low, but not zero, probability.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Correct.  
2. Base rate: 89% among signatories, aligned.  
3. Consistency: 5 times in 100, Sudan manages this last-minute ratification.  
4. Key evidence: Latest ratification status; 25-day window; conflict paralysis.  
5. Blind spot: Sudden political settlement and transitional government push to fast-track ratification.  
6. Status quo: Highly volatile; minor likelihood increases if peace deal emerges, but not yet.

Probability: 5%
Predicted Probability: 5.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question  
   “Will Sudan deposit its ratification instrument for the AfCFTA by 1 July 2025?” (deadline in ~25 days).

2. Source analysis  
   a. TRALAC (Gerhard Erasmus, Mar 5 2024):  
      • Facts: 54 of 55 AU members signed; 47 ratified; Sudan among eight non-state parties; PSTC (tariff schedule) outstanding for Sudan.  
      • Quality: Highly reliable trade-law centre analysis. No opinion.  
   b. fDi Intelligence (June 5 2024):  
      • Facts: Seven signatories (including Sudan) remain non-state parties; procedural hurdles noted.  
      • Quality: Reputable business source citing UNECA. Facts vs. quoted expert opinions clearly distinguished.  
   c. Ddcustomslaw (June 6 2025):  
      • Facts: As of today, Sudan still has not submitted or had verified its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions; eight states still un-ratified.  
      • Quality: Specialist customs-law blog with up-to-date AU Secretariat data.  
   d. TheAfricaReport (June 13 2024):  
      • Facts: AfCFTA boss warns integration will take decades; notes Sudan stakeholders have reviewed a draft strategy but gives no timetable for ratification.  
      • Quality: Solid journalism quoting AfCFTA Secretariat; mixes facts with leadership’s strategic outlook.

3. Reference-class and outside view anchor  
   – Base rate: 47/54 ≈ 87% of signatories have ratified by mid-2025.  
   – But among the eight “late adopters” (Benin, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Eritrea), ratification pace from Jan 2025 to Jun 2025 is 0/8.  
   – Countries in active conflict or severe political transition (e.g. South Sudan, Libya) have not ratified in the final window. Sudan’s internal strife and AU suspension indicate low capacity.

4. Inside-view factors  
   a. Procedural steps still undone: Sudan has neither submitted a PSTC nor convened the necessary committee to draft domestic implementing legislation.  
   b. Political context: Ongoing war, parallel governments, humanitarian crisis; little sign of parliamentary bandwidth or executive priority for trade-law reform.  
   c. No high-level Sudanese pledge or roadmap publicly announced in H1 2025.  
   d. Other conflict-affected holdouts show no late-June rush; AU Secretariat updates indicate no deposit pipeline.

5. Timeframe analysis  
   – ~25 days until resolution. Typical ratification requires draft legislation, parliamentary approval, presidential signature, and deposit notification—each step normally takes weeks or months.  
   – If timeframe were doubled (≈50 days), probability might rise modestly (to perhaps 10–15%) if a push occurred. Halved (~12 days) would push probability toward zero.

6. Evidence weighting  
   Strong evidence (large downward shift):  
     • Ddcustomslaw (6 Jun 2025): Sudan still has not submitted PSTC or ratified.  
     • Historical patterns: zero holdouts ratified in last six months.  
   Moderate evidence (moderate shift):  
     • fDi Intelligence: procedural and political hurdles.  
     • TheAfricaReport: no Sudanese deadline announced.  
   Weak evidence (small shift):  
     • Anecdote of draft strategy review under IGAD.  

7. Justification of probability shift  
   – Anchor 87% ratification base rate but heavily discounted for cohort of holdouts (0% ratification in recent period).  
   – Political-instability adjustment: reduces near-term chance to single digits.  
   – Timing constraint: needed procedural steps and political will unlikely in 25 days.  
   Final inside-view probability: ~5%.

Probability calibration  
I predict that Sudan has a very small chance—around 5%—to complete and deposit its AfCFTA ratification instrument by 1 July 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase—OK.  
2. Base rate=87%, adjusted to 5% for holdouts and context.  
3. “5 out of 100 times, Sudan ratifies by 1 July 2025.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Sudan still hasn’t submitted PSTC (strong).  
   • Zero of eight holdouts ratified since Jan 2025 (strong).  
   • No public Sudanese ratification pledge in 2025 (moderate).  
   • Only ~25 days remain vs. months of legislative steps (strong).  
5. Blind spot—Surprise peace deal or executive emergency decree fast-tracking ratification.  
6. Status quo—likely no deposit before cutoff.

Probability: 5%
Predicted Probability: 5.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• TRALAC blog (Erasmus, Mar-24) – long-running trade-law think-tank; factual data on signatories/ratifications and tariff-schedule submissions. High reliability, low bias, still current.  
• fDi Intelligence (Jun-24) – FT affiliate; surveys AfCFTA hurdles and quotes specialists. Good reliability; lightly analytical.  
• DDCustomsLaw note (Jun-25) – customs consultancy summarising AU minutes; mostly factual, cites official numbers up to May-25. Medium reliability but internally consistent with TRALAC.  
• TheAfricaReport (Jun-24) – pan-African business magazine; interview with AfCFTA SG. Useful for institutional timelines; moderate reliability.  
• AskNews packet (Feb-25 – Jun-25) – a dozen wire items on Sudan war and AU reactions; mainstream outlets (Al-Jazeera, Anadolu, State Dept, AU communiqués). All confirm severe governance breakdown; no item mentions AfCFTA ratification progress. High reliability for conflict status, negative evidence for treaty movement.

Across 15+ recent sources, none report draft bills, cabinet approval or AU deposit by Sudan, while several explicitly list Sudan among the eight non-ratifiers as late as May-25.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong evidence  
• Structural: Sudan’s national legislature is non-functional and the state is in a two-year civil war (multiple mainstream wires, AU PSC communiqués). Hard to change in 25 days.  
• Institutional: AU suspended Sudan; parallel authorities contest legitimacy. A valid instrument of ratification must come from a government the AU Commission accepts.  
Moderate evidence  
• Historical rhythm: only one ratification among the six remaining signatories in the last 12 months ⇒ ≈17 % annual hazard per country.  
• Process precedent: other ratifiers have required cabinet + parliamentary endorsement plus AU deposit, typically many weeks; there is no sign Sudan has even begun.  
Weak evidence  
• Possibility that a warring faction might make a symbolic deposit to curry AU favour at the July summit.

Net effect: strong negative evidence outweighs any weak positive.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining to 1 Jul 2025: 25 days ≈0.07 yr. If the window were doubled to 50 days, probability rises only slightly (≈+0.5 pp) because next AU summit opens 2-3 July; if halved to 12 days, probability drops ~40 % proportionally.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (derived from 1 ratification per 6 hold-outs per year) gives ≈1.2 % for a random country over 25 days.  
Sudan-specific factors cut the odds roughly in half:  
• Governance collapse → very low capacity to pass a ratification bill (−40 %).  
• AU suspension and contested legitimacy make deposit acceptance doubtful (−30 %).  
• No preparatory steps (tariff schedule, PSTC) lodged (−20 %).  
Combined shrinkage (~50 – 60 %) moves the forecast to about 0.5 – 0.7 %.  
I round to 1 % to reflect residual tail risks (e.g., sudden political deal plus ceremonial deposit at month-end).

Probability calibration
My inside-view probability that Sudan will ratify AfCFTA before 1 July 2025 is 1 %.  
Interpretation: in 1 out of 100 comparable worlds, an accepted Sudanese instrument of ratification reaches the AU Commission within the next 25 days.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “By 1 Jul 2025 will Sudan deposit a valid AfCFTA ratification?”  
2. Base rate ≈1.2 %; final 1 % remains anchored.  
3. Consistency – “1 out of 100 times, Sudan ratifies in time.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) ongoing civil war & split authority; (ii) AU suspension; (iii) no legislative action reported; (iv) only 1 ratification among remaining six in last year.  
5. Blind-spot – Surprise unity deal at AU pre-summit with rapid procedural rubber-stamp. Would lift odds to ~10 %.  
6. Status-quo bias checked: status quo = no ratification; conflict makes change unlikely; slight nudge toward status quo applied.

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%...
