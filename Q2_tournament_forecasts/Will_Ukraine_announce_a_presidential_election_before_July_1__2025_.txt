Analysis:
Ukraine’s constitution and electoral law prescribe when and how presidential election dates must be announced. Historically, the Verkhovna Rada or Central Election Commission sets a specific election day well in advance—typically between two and six months before voting—although there have been exceptional cases (early elections in 2014, postponements of local polls in wartime). To form an out-view baseline, I need the typical lead time and legal deadlines for announcing presidential elections plus any precedents for delays or emergency changes. This will show the usual window for an announcement and how war or other crises have affected timing.

Current context LLM output:
Analysis:
Ukraine is currently under martial law, which by law prohibits holding national elections while in effect. Martial law is routinely extended by the Verkhovna Rada in 90-day increments; the next vote on extension is expected in early June 2025. An official election date can only be announced once martial law is lifted. To assess the likelihood of a date announcement before July 1, 2025, I need up-to-date reporting on (a) the government’s plans for the June 2025 martial law vote, (b) any signals from the President or Central Election Commission about scheduling the election, and (c) parliamentary debates or public statements regarding an election timeline. These data will inform whether an announcement is plausible before the mid-2025 cutoff.

Key Facts and Statistics  
• Martial law and elections  
  – Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.  
  – Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections under martial law; lifting it requires the war to end and peace guarantees.  
  – Once martial law is lifted, Ukraine’s Central Election Commission (CEC) must announce the start of the campaign, and presidential elections must follow 90 days later.  
• Displacement and infrastructure  
  – UN figures: over 6 million Ukrainians abroad, 3.6 million internally displaced.  
  – About 18% of Ukraine’s territory remains occupied; “millions more” live in occupied areas (Zelensky).  
  – Significant destruction of schools and other electoral infrastructure; restoration could take up to a year plus a special post-war elections law.  

Polls and Approval Ratings  
• KIIS poll (Feb. 4–9, published Feb. 19): 57% of Ukrainians trust President Zelensky, up five points since December.  
• Reuters poll (Feb. 19): 44% approval rating for U.S. President Trump.  
• Levada Center (Jan. 2025): 87% approval for Russian President Putin (noting Russia’s restrictive political climate).  

Notable Opinions  
• Donald Trump (Feb. 18–19):  
  – Repeated Russia’s claim that Zelensky is a “dictator” with “4% approval” and called for Ukraine to hold elections despite war.  
  – Falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war.  
• Volodymyr Zelensky (Feb. 19 press conference):  
  – Dismissed Trump’s “4%” figure as Russian disinformation.  
  – Insisted Ukraine must be part of any peace talks.  
• Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesperson:  
  – Suggested Russia would consider talks with Zelensky only if “legal aspects related to his legitimacy” are addressed.  
• Fedir Venislavskyi (MP, Defense Committee, Zelensky’s party):  
  – Argued martial law cannot be lifted by mere ceasefire; lasting peace and withdrawal of Russian forces are prerequisites.  
• Olha Aivazovska (Opora, election watchdog):  
  – Stated post-peace agreement ratification should trigger lifting martial law and restoration of electoral infrastructure, with CEC launching a 90-day presidential campaign.  

Potential Presidential Contenders  
• Volodymyr Zelensky:  
  – Initially pledged to serve one term; has not formally ruled out running again, citing dependence on war outcome and public will.  
• Valerii Zaluzhnyi (former Commander-in-Chief):  
  – Has not declared political ambitions but topped a trust-rating poll last February.  

Points of Contention  
• Timing of elections hinges entirely on the end of hostilities and the lifting of martial law under Ukrainian constitutional provisions.  
• U.S. and Russian discussions in Saudi Arabia on ending the war have excluded Ukraine, raising questions about any peace deal’s terms and legitimacy.

  – Volodymyr Zelensky: 24.7% support  
  – Yulia Tymoshenko: 18.3%  
  – Incumbent Petro Poroshenko: 16.8%  

Objective and named-source opinions  
• Zelensky  
  – Comedian and political novice; launched candidacy Dec 31, 2018.  
  – Electoral program crowdsourced via Facebook comments.  
  – Does not mention EU membership; says Ukraine would seek NATO and “other” security alliances simultaneously (impractical dual membership).  
  – Contradictory on peace with Russia: platform says “no giving up territory,” yet in December said he’d “negotiate even with the devil” to save lives.  
  – Lacks concrete diplomatic experience; oversimplifies foreign-policy challenges.  
  – Met economic advisers on IMF cooperation, suggesting some openness to expert input.  

• Tymoshenko  
  – 23-year political veteran; former prime minister; leader of the “Fatherland” party (associate member of the European People’s Party).  
  – Portrays herself as a “reset” from old elite, yet is part of that elite.  
  – Domestic-policy platform detailed; foreign-policy proposals are broad and underdeveloped.  
  – Vows EU and NATO membership but omits specifics on accession processes or timelines.  
  – Proposes a “Budapest+ Memorandum” to expand 1994 security assurances to include Germany, France, China, and possibly the EU High Representative, aiming to pressure Russia and secure Western military aid.  

• Poroshenko  
  – Mentioned as one of three realistic contenders (current president), but no detailed foreign-policy analysis provided in the extracted text.  

Less-reliable or implied opinions  
• Zelensky’s statements characterized as potentially “populist rhetoric” or “exaggerated for effect.”  
• Concerns about Tymoshenko’s past dealings with Moscow, given her failure to explicitly prioritize EU integration in her platform.  

Overall thrust  
The article assesses how each leading candidate’s background and policy vagueness—or lack thereof—might influence Ukraine’s pursuit of EU and NATO integration and its handling of Russian aggression, underscoring significant uncertainties should either Zelensky or Tymoshenko win.

<Summary source="https://www.voanews.com/a/perspectives-challenges-of-ukraine-s-next-election/7991546.html">
Disclaimer: Summary based solely on the February 28, 2025 VOA article “Perspectives, challenges of Ukraine’s next election.”

1. Background & Legal Constraints  
  • President Zelenskyy was elected April 2019; the next presidential vote was due March–April 2024.  
  • Martial law, in effect since Russia’s February 2022 invasion, legally prohibits presidential elections.  

2. U.S. Political Pressure  
  • Former President Donald Trump (Truth Social, Feb. 19): accused Zelenskyy of refusing elections, labeled him a “Dictator without Elections.”  
  • Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO): “They need to practice [democracy]” despite martial law.  
  • Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN): argues lack of elections lets Russia claim Zelenskyy’s illegitimacy.  

3. Russian Position  
  • President Vladimir Putin (Dec. 19 Q&A): won’t negotiate until Ukraine’s leadership is legitimized via elections.  

4. Ukrainian Leadership & Public Opinion  
  • Zelenskyy (Feb. 23 press conference): would step down for peace but opposes elections under martial law—cites security (267 drone attacks) and inability of half the country to vote.  
  • Main opposition figures—Poroshenko, Tymoshenko, Klitschko—also reject holding elections now.  
  • February poll: 63% of Ukrainians oppose elections under current conditions.  

5. Expert & NGO Analysis on Feasibility  
  • Yevhenii Radchenko (ex–deputy chair, Central Election Commission): wartime voting violates “universal, equal, free” standards; electoral infrastructure heavily damaged; safety guarantees impossible.  
  • OPORA and allied NGOs (Feb. 27 statement): democratic elections require “sustainable peace.”  
  • Olga Aivazovska (OPORA chair): martial law’s purpose is defense; elections would enable Russian manipulation—potential terror attacks on polling stations; contested legitimacy if turnout falls to 5–10%.  
  • Voting demographics challenge:  
      – ~14 million internally displaced or serving in armed forces.  
      – ~7 million refugees abroad; in 2004, 103,000 abroad voted via embassies/consulates—now infeasible at scale without major resources.  
      – Occupied-territory residents face coercion, torture, cannot vote freely.  

6. International Observers & U.S. Congress Views  
  • Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA): elections should await safe, fair conditions.  
  • Rep. Eugene Vindman (D-NY): with 20% territory occupied and mass displacement, credible elections impossible until stable peace.  
  • Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND): U.S. WWII elections differ—U.S. wasn’t invaded at home.  
  • Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI): suggested Trump’s pro-Ukraine stance might facilitate an electoral timeline.  
  • Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE): Russia lacks credibility to demand elections, citing its own democratic deficits.  
  • OSCE/ODIHR (Katya Andrusz): at Ukraine’s request, preparing to help organize future elections to meet international standards once prerequisites exist.

<Summary source="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/8/trump-putin-want-zelenskyy-out-but-is-a-vote-possible-in-wartime-ukraine">
Disclaimer: Extraction is based solely on the provided Al Jazeera article by Mansur Mirovalev.  

1. Context and Political Pressure  
- Donald Trump (Feb 19) and Vladimir Putin (Feb 24) both publicly urged a snap Ukrainian presidential vote, claiming Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s approval had fallen to “4 percent.”  
- Kyiv International Institute of Sociology polls show Zelenskyy’s approval actually rose from 52 percent in December 2023 to 57 percent in February 2024; 37 percent of respondents said they do not trust him.  
- Former General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, fired by Zelenskyy in Feb 2024 and now Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, holds a 62 percent approval rating but has stated he will not run while the war continues.  
- Trump’s aides also reportedly approached Yulia Tymoshenko and Petro Poroshenko about a potential candidacy; Tymoshenko’s trust level was 10.6 percent (Rozumkov Center, Mar 25), Poroshenko’s was 17 percent.  

2. Legal and Logistical Obstacles  
- Ukrainian constitution and election law prohibit any nationwide election during martial law. Martial law has been in place since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in Feb 2022.  
- To hold a vote, Ukraine would need to demobilise roughly 700,000 servicemen so they could register, stand as candidates and cast ballots—deemed “hardly possible” with active fighting along a 1,200 km front.  
- Russia’s forces still advance (133 km² gained in March vs. 730 km² in November 2023, per Khortitsya Telegram channel), and shelling of cities poses security risks for mass gatherings at polling stations.  
- Thousands of schools and administrative buildings (usual polling sites) have been destroyed or are unsafe; security cannot be guaranteed for international observers.  

3. Voter Registration and Diaspora Challenges  
- Ukraine’s population was 34.7 million in 2022; since then:  
  • 6.9 million fled abroad  
  • 3.7 million internally displaced  
  • 5 million remain in occupied territories  
  • 1.3 million reside in Russia or Belarus (per UN), where they face repression if they attempt to vote  
- Embassies/consulates could be overwhelmed by paper ballots from refugees; electronic voting via the Diia app malfunctioned during Eurovision selections in February.  

4. Timing According to Law  
- Once martial law is lifted, a presidential election could legally be held 90 days later.  
- Some ruling party figures (David Arakhamia, Servant of the People) state that all parliamentary factions agreed elections would occur six months after martial law’s end.  

5. Recent Rumors and Responses  
- The Economist (unnamed government sources) reported Kyiv is preparing a vote and Zelenskyy expects to run.  
- Servant of the People head David Arakhamia publicly dismissed that, reiterating the six-month-post-martial-law timeline.

Query: Provide detailed historical context on how and when Ukraine officially announces presidential election dates, including constitutional requirements, typical lead times from announcement to voting, and any precedents for early or postponed elections due to emergencies since 1991.
# Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of Ukrainian Presidential Elections  

Ukraine’s presidential election system has evolved significantly since the country’s independence in 1991, shaped by constitutional reforms, legislative changes, and responses to political crises. This report examines the constitutional requirements, procedural timelines, and historical precedents governing the announcement and conduct of presidential elections, with particular attention to disruptions caused by emergencies.  

---

## Constitutional Foundations of Presidential Elections  

Ukraine’s presidential election framework is rooted in its **1996 Constitution**, amended in 2004 and 2019. Article 103 establishes the president’s five-year term, universal suffrage, and eligibility criteria, including a ten-year residency requirement and fluency in Ukrainian[9]. Crucially, Article 108 mandates that the sitting president retains power until a successor is inaugurated, preventing a power vacuum during transitions[10].  

The **Verkhovna Rada** (Ukraine’s parliament) holds exclusive authority to schedule elections under Article 85(7). Ordinary elections occur on the last Sunday of March in the fifth year of the presidential term, with the parliament required to announce them at least 100 days in advance[2][3]. Extraordinary elections, triggered by resignation, impeachment, or death, must be held within 90 days of the vacancy[2][3].  

Martial law introduces critical constraints. The 2015 **Law on the Legal Regime of Martial Law** explicitly bans elections during such periods, a provision upheld by the 2019 Electoral Code[1][5]. This legal barrier aims to ensure stability but has sparked debates about executive legitimacy during prolonged conflicts[4][8].  

---

## Historical Evolution of Election Scheduling  

### Post-Independence Transition (1991–2004)  
Ukraine’s first presidential elections in 1991 saw Leonid Kravchuk elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet, transitioning to presidency after independence. The **1994 elections**, moved forward via a political compromise between Kravchuk and parliament, marked the first peaceful transfer of power in the CIS when Leonid Kuchma defeated the incumbent[12]. This precedent demonstrated early adherence to constitutional norms despite political turbulence.  

### The Orange Revolution and Electoral Reforms (2004–2010)  
The 2004 election, marred by fraud allegations, culminated in the **Orange Revolution** and a Supreme Court-ordered rerun. The court cited violations under Article 76 of the Election Law, including ballot stuffing and media bias, and mandated a second round within three weeks[6]. This case underscored judicial oversight in resolving electoral disputes, though critics noted delays in addressing constitutional questions[6].  

### Post-Euromaidan Adjustments (2014–2019)  
Following Viktor Yanukovych’s ouster in 2014, the Verkhovna Rada invoked Article 112 to appoint an acting president and schedule **snap elections** for May 25, 2014[11]. The truncated 60-day timeline, while legal, faced logistical challenges due to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and ongoing conflict in Donbas. These elections reinforced parliamentary authority in crisis management.  

---

## Procedural Timelines and Announcement Protocols  

### Ordinary Elections  
Per the Electoral Code, the Verkhovna Rada must announce ordinary elections **no later than 130 days** before the vote, with the electoral process formally beginning 120 days prior[2][3]. For example, the 2019 election timeline saw candidate registration closing on February 8, district commissions formed by February 18, and precinct commissions finalized by March 12[13]. Campaigning typically spans 90 days, ending 24 hours before polls open[13].  

### Extraordinary and Repeat Elections  
Extraordinary elections follow a condensed 90-day schedule from the vacancy date. The 2014 snap election exemplified this, with parliament announcing the vote on February 22 and holding it on May 25[11]. Repeat elections, required if no candidate secures a majority or all candidates withdraw, follow similar timelines but require a Central Election Commission (CEC) petition[2][3].  

---

## Precedents of Early and Postponed Elections  

### Early Elections: 1994 and 2014  
The **1994 election** was moved forward via a legislative agreement to resolve a political stalemate, setting a precedent for early votes under Article 82 of the 1996 Constitution[12]. In 2014, Yanukovych’s removal triggered extraordinary elections under Article 108, demonstrating constitutional flexibility during coups[11].  

### Postponements: Martial Law (2022–Present)  
Russia’s 2022 invasion led to an unprecedented election freeze. Article 19 of the **Martial Law Act** suspended all elections, while Article 108 ensured President Zelenskyy’s continuity[1][4]. Parliament extensions of martial law, most recently to August 2025, have deferred elections despite the original March 2024 constitutional deadline[4][14]. Over 200 civil society groups and all major parties endorse this postponement, citing risks to voter access and security[4][14].  

---

## Legitimacy and Executive Continuity  

Critics like Dmitry Peskov and Donald Trump have questioned Zelenskyy’s legitimacy, but constitutional scholars emphasize that Article 108’s continuity clause maintains legality[8][10]. The February 2025 parliamentary resolution reaffirmed that elections will occur only after “comprehensive peace,” countering external pressure[14].  

Practically, holding elections remains unfeasible: 18% of territory is occupied, 14 million are displaced, and military personnel cannot vote securely[4][8]. Legal reforms to enable wartime voting would require constitutional amendments, prohibited under martial law[10].  

---

## Conclusion  

Ukraine’s presidential election system balances democratic principles with crisis adaptability. Constitutional provisions for term continuity and parliamentary authority have enabled stability during invasions and revolutions. While martial law suspensions test democratic norms, they reflect pragmatic responses to existential threats. Post-conflict elections will likely require international oversight and updated voter registries to address displacement. Historical precedents suggest Ukraine can restore electoral integrity once security permits, guided by its robust legal framework.</Perplexity_report>

<Summary source="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-parliament-extends-martial-law-until-august-2025-04-16/">
Disclaimer: summarizing Reuters reporting; no additional sources consulted.

Key points from Reuters, April 16, 2025 (reporting by Olena Harmash; editing by David Holmes):

1. Ukraine’s parliament voted 357–0 (with a handful of abstentions) on April 16 to extend martial law through August 2025.
2. Under martial law, Ukraine can continue mobilizing troops and must suspend its electoral calendar—new elections are legally barred while martial law is in force.
3. The extension came amid continued war with Russia and external calls (notably from U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin) to hold elections—Trump has labeled President Zelenskiy a “dictator,” which, paradoxically, has boosted Zelenskiy’s domestic approval ratings.
4. Peace talks brokered by the Trump administration had raised hopes of a ceasefire and eventual elections, prompting some opposition figures to more openly challenge Zelenskiy.
5. Petro Poroshenko, former president and leader of the European Solidarity party, agreed extension was necessary after recent Russian strikes on Sumy and Kryvyi Rih but accused Zelenskiy of abusing martial law to consolidate power. Only one Poroshenko-party MP voted against the extension.
6. No announcement of a specific future presidential election date was made; martial law suspension of elections remains in effect until August.

<Summary source="https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-presidential-election-volodymyr-zelenskyy-war-with-russia-v2/a-71549712">
Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the DW article “Should Ukraine hold a presidential election in 2025?” by Roman Goncharenko (02/08/2025), translated from German.

Key facts and context  
• Ukraine’s last presidential vote was in 2019; the next election was postponed because the constitution bars voting under martial law.  
• President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says an election will be announced once “the hot phase of the war ends and martial law is lifted” (interview with Piers Morgan, early February 2025).

Opinions from named, reliable sources  
• Keith Kellogg (US Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia): Told Reuters in early February that the US “wanted Ukraine to hold elections, potentially before the end of this year,” arguing elections are “good for democracy.”  
• Vladimir Putin (Russian President): Has questioned Zelenskyy’s legitimacy, insisting Russia won’t sign any peace settlement until Ukraine holds a new presidential vote.  
• John Herbst (former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Atlantic Council):  
  – Sees Russia’s push for elections as a stalling tactic to weaken negotiations.  
  – Warns it would be “dangerous” for Ukraine’s democracy and security to hold polls under current conditions.  
  – Says elections should only take place after guarantees such as more weapons, a demilitarized zone, European troops, and a “serious” ceasefire—conditions Moscow rejects.  
• Winfried Schneider-Deters (German Ukraine expert):  
  – Argues Russia’s demand is “perfidious,” aimed at sowing unrest and division during a campaign.  
  – Advises Ukraine against yielding to US pressure but notes Kyiv’s dependence on American arms.  
• Thomas Greminger (former OSCE Secretary General):  
  – Believes free and fair elections are impossible now, given martial law, occupation of large territories, and media/movement restrictions.  
  – Points to global examples where premature elections backfired.  
  – Says a stable, monitored ceasefire sustained for at least six months would be a precondition; estimates the chance of a 2025 vote at under 1%.  

Overall assessment in the article  
• Broad consensus among experts that, without lifted martial law, a serious ceasefire, full territorial control, and election-ready conditions, Ukraine cannot credibly hold a presidential vote in 2025.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Kyiv Independent (Feb 2025)**: Reputable Ukrainian source providing factual information about martial law prohibiting elections, the 90-day requirement after lifting martial law, and displacement statistics (6+ million abroad, 3.6+ million internally displaced). Contains expert opinions from MP Venislavskyi and election watchdog Aivazovska confirming the constitutional requirements.

2. **FPRI Article (2019)**: Historical context on the 2019 election; limited relevance to current conditions but establishes normal electoral patterns pre-invasion.

3. **POLITICO Article (2013)**: Outdated historical information on earlier election announcements.

4. **Wilson Center (Nov 2024)**: Focuses on Ukrainian reactions to Trump's election; provides evidence of international political pressure but limited direct relevance to election scheduling.

5. **VOA Article (Feb 2025)**: Comprehensive and recent overview of election constraints: cites constitutional prohibitions, political pressure from U.S. and Russia, and a February poll showing 63% of Ukrainians oppose wartime elections. Includes expert perspectives from Radchenko (ex-CEC official) and international observers on feasibility issues.

6. **Al Jazeera (April 2025)**: Most recent article with current approval ratings and logistical challenges. Notes Servant of the People party head Arakhamia stated all parliamentary factions agreed to hold elections six months after martial law ends. Mentions a dismissed Economist report about vote preparations.

7. **Perplexity Report**: Provides detailed constitutional framework: 100-130 day announcement requirements for regular elections, Article 108 ensuring presidential continuity, and confirmation of martial law extension to August 2025.

Overall, the VOA, Al Jazeera, and Perplexity sources are most reliable and timely for this analysis.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Potential reference classes:

1. **Standard Ukrainian election announcements** - Limited relevance due to martial law exception.

2. **Elections during ongoing wars** - Some countries hold elections during conflicts, but Ukraine's specific legal prohibition makes this less applicable.

3. **Ukrainian political decisions under international pressure** - Somewhat relevant given current U.S./Russian pressure.

4. **Presidential term extensions during national emergencies** - Most relevant reference class, as Ukraine has effectively extended Zelensky's term through the martial law provision.

The fourth reference class is most suitable. In such cases, terms typically remain extended until the emergency concludes or substantial resolution occurs.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The forecast period is from today (May 16, 2025) until July 1, 2025 – approximately 45 days.

Critical timeline factors:
- Martial law is currently extended through August 2025, beyond our forecast horizon
- Constitutional requirements mandate elections 90 days after martial law ends
- Parliamentary consensus reportedly supports a 6-month post-martial law timeframe

For an election announcement before July 1, either:
1. Ukraine would need to announce elections while martial law is still active (illegal under current law), or
2. Martial law would need to have been lifted by April 1, 2025 (already past)

Both scenarios appear extremely unlikely given the legal framework and timeline constraints.

## (d) Justification

Multiple factors suggest an extremely low probability of an election announcement before July 1:

1. **Legal barriers**: Ukrainian law explicitly prohibits elections during martial law.

2. **Institutional consensus**: All major parties and 200+ civil society groups support postponement.

3. **Public opinion**: 63% of Ukrainians oppose wartime elections (February 2025 poll).

4. **Logistical impossibility**: With 18% of territory occupied, 14 million internally displaced or in military service, and 7 million refugees abroad, free and fair elections face insurmountable challenges.

5. **Timeline constraints**: Even if martial law were suddenly lifted (unlikely given the August 2025 extension), the constitutional timeline would push any election beyond July 1.

6. **Political stability concerns**: Ukrainian leadership has consistently emphasized the danger of destabilizing the country through premature elections during an existential conflict.

While international pressure from the U.S. and Russia exists, Ukrainian officials have remained firmly committed to legal restrictions against wartime elections.

## Outside View Calibration:

My calibration must reflect the extraordinary barriers to an election announcement within this timeframe:

- The reference class of national emergency term extensions shows such extensions typically persist until the emergency substantially resolves.
- The 63% public opposition to wartime elections provides a rough inverse baseline (~37% supporting).
- However, this greatly overestimates the probability since it doesn't account for legal prohibitions and institutional consensus.
- The timeline makes it virtually impossible – martial law extends beyond our forecast period, and constitutional requirements create minimum delays exceeding our timeframe.
- The only plausible scenarios involve extreme events: sudden war conclusion, extraordinary law changes under foreign pressure, or government collapse – all extremely unlikely within 45 days.

Given these constraints, I assess there is approximately a 1% chance of Ukraine announcing presidential elections before July 1, 2025.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **The Kyiv Independent (Feb 19, 2025)**:
   - Factual: Ukrainian law prohibits elections under martial law; after lifting martial law, elections must follow 90 days later; 6+ million Ukrainians abroad, 3.6+ million internally displaced; 18% of territory occupied.
   - Expert opinions from election official Olha Aivazovska and MP Fedir Venislavskyi on legal requirements for elections.
   - High-quality, recent source from respected Ukrainian outlet.

2. **FPRI article (March 2019)**:
   - Focuses on 2019 election; provides historical context but less relevant to current situation.
   - Shows normal electoral process pre-war.

3. **POLITICO article (Nov 30, 2013)**:
   - Historical information about previous snap election.
   - Limited relevance to current circumstances.

4. **Wilson Center article (Nov 21, 2024)**:
   - Covers Ukrainian reactions to Trump's 2024 election win.
   - Indicates Ukrainian officials' awareness of U.S. policy implications.
   - Moderate relevance for understanding external pressures.

5. **VOA article (Feb 28, 2025)**:
   - Recent reporting noting 63% of Ukrainians oppose wartime elections.
   - Expert opinion from former Central Election Commission deputy chair.
   - Multiple U.S. Congressional perspectives presented.
   - High-quality source with specific data points and named experts.

6. **Al Jazeera article (April 8, 2025)**:
   - Most recent source (April 2025).
   - Specific polling data contradicting Trump/Putin claims about Zelensky's popularity.
   - Details logistical obstacles: 700,000 servicemen would need to demobilize, destroyed polling infrastructure.
   - Notes official position that elections would occur 6 months after martial law ends.
   - Comprehensive with specific data and attributable sources.

7. **Perplexity report**:
   - Thorough analysis of Ukrainian election laws and procedures.
   - Key facts: Constitution requires ordinary elections in 5th year; parliament must announce 100+ days in advance.
   - 2015 Law on Legal Regime of Martial Law and 2019 Electoral Code ban elections during martial law.
   - Article 108 ensures sitting president retains power until successor inaugurated.
   - Parliament extended martial law to August 2025.
   - Well-researched with specific legal frameworks cited.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Potential reference classes:

1. **Ukrainian presidential elections since 1991** - Limited relevance due to unprecedented wartime circumstances.

2. **Global elections during active conflicts** - More relevant but constrained by Ukraine's specific legal prohibition.

3. **Presidential term extensions during emergencies** - Highly relevant as Ukraine is currently in this situation.

4. **Elections following martial law periods** - Most specifically relevant, though limited comparable examples.

The most suitable reference class is a combination of #3 and #4 - examining cases where presidential terms were extended during national emergencies and how elections were scheduled after martial law periods. Ukraine's situation is distinctive because the legal prohibition on elections during martial law is explicit and currently extended beyond our forecast horizon.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction timeframe is approximately 45 days (from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025).

Critical timeline factors:
- Martial law is currently extended to August 2025 (past our deadline).
- Ukrainian law requires presidential elections to be announced 90-100+ days before they occur.
- For an announcement to occur before July 1, 2025, martial law would need to be lifted by early April 2025 at the latest.
- Ruling party officials have indicated elections would occur 6 months after martial law ends, not the minimum 90 days.

## (d) Justification:

Several factors make an election announcement before July 1, 2025 highly unlikely:

1. **Legal impossibility**: Ukrainian law explicitly prohibits elections during martial law, which is currently extended to August 2025 (beyond our deadline).

2. **Procedural requirements**: Once martial law is lifted, the election process requires at least 90 days, with ruling party officials indicating a 6-month post-martial law timeline.

3. **Broad domestic consensus**: All major political figures, including opposition leaders, agree elections should not occur during active conflict. 63% of Ukrainians oppose wartime elections (February 2025 poll).

4. **Logistical barriers**: 
   - Nearly half the population is displaced (6.9M abroad, 3.7M internally, 5M in occupied territories)
   - 700,000 military personnel would be unable to properly participate
   - Extensive destruction of electoral infrastructure
   - Security threats to polling stations and observers

5. **Constitutional continuity**: Article 108 ensures Zelensky remains in power until a successor is inaugurated, addressing legitimacy concerns.

6. **Ongoing conflict**: Russian forces continued to make territorial gains as of March 2025, suggesting no imminent peace.

While external pressure exists from figures like Trump and Putin for Ukraine to hold elections, domestic legal requirements and practical realities make compliance nearly impossible within our timeframe.

## Outside view calibration:

Given the legal prohibition on elections during martial law, and current extension of martial law to August 2025, an election announcement before July 1, 2025 would require:

1. A dramatic and unexpected improvement in the war situation leading to early termination of martial law, AND
2. A decision to announce elections immediately upon lifting martial law.

The current martial law extension alone suggests a probability below 5%. The consensus that elections would follow 6 months after martial law ends (not immediately) further reduces this probability. While external pressure from Trump/Putin slightly increases the probability, legal constraints remain paramount.

The only plausible scenario leading to an election announcement would be an unexpected peace agreement reached in May-June 2025, followed by immediate cessation of martial law and an unprecedented rush to announce elections contrary to the stated 6-month timeline. This sequence of events seems highly improbable given current conditions.

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Kyiv Independent guide (Feb. 19, 2025): High‐quality local reporting. Facts: Ukraine under martial law since Feb 2022; martial law legally bans presidential elections; lifting martial law requires peace agreement and Russian withdrawal; CEC must then give 90 days’ notice. Opinions from credible election‐watch NGOs (Opora) and MPs confirm legal/technical hurdles.  
- FPRI article (Mar. 2019): Background on how Ukraine schedules elections in normal times; outdated for war context. Contains useful baseline on announcement–vote lead times (100–130 days), but does not account for martial law.  
- Politico article (Nov. 2013): Describes snap elections after Yanukovych’s ouster; illustrates parliament can call elections in crises. Historical precedent, but differs from current martial‐law prohibition.  
- Wilson Center (Nov. 21, 2024): Ukrainian reactions to U.S. election; peripheral to our question. Context on Ukraine–U.S. relations but no direct relevance to announcement timing.  
- VOA (Feb. 28, 2025): Reliable U.S. government–funded source. Confirms broad expert consensus: elections cannot be held (or announced) under martial law; 63% of Ukrainians oppose wartime elections; OSCE/ODIHR preparing post-war support.  
- Al Jazeera (Apr. 8, 2025): Solid international reporting. Details legal prohibitions, massive displacement (14 million unable to vote), destroyed infrastructure, and Servant of the People party’s internal agreement that elections occur six months after martial‐law end. Debunks rumors of an imminent vote.  
- Perplexity report (heterogeneous): Comprehensive historical review of Ukraine’s electoral framework. Confirms constitutional requirement for a minimum lead time (100–130 days) and martial law suspension of elections since Feb 2022; martial law extensions now run to August 2025.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
- “Elections under martial law in Ukraine” (no historical instances): reference class = 0% success.  
- “Election announcements within two months of period end in war‐affected democracies”: extremely rare; typically zero.  
- “Announcements within statutory window but without lifting legal ban”: impossible.  
Most suitable reference class is Ukraine’s own wartime election practice: zero announcements since Feb 2022, martial law extended past our deadline.

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Time left: ~45 days (May 16 – July 1, 2025).  
- Under normal law, CEC must announce elections ≥90 days before voting, so any legally valid announcement by July 1 must target a vote before Oct 2025, violating the six‐month post-martial-law framework.  
- Martial law, which legally prohibits elections, has just been extended through August 2025, making any announcement before July 1 both illegal and logistically infeasible.

4. Justification  
- Legal barrier: Martial law prohibits announcement.  
- Political consensus: Ukrainian leadership and all major parties agree elections await peace.  
- Logistic barriers: Infrastructure destroyed; electorate dispersed; no time for the 90-day campaign.  
- Historical precedent: No wartime announcements; snap elections only after regime removal, not under martial law.  
- Even if martial law were unexpectedly lifted in May/June, statutory 90-day notice pushes any announcement beyond July 1.  

Outside‐view calibration:  
Given zero historical occurrences of announcements under martial law, the freshly extended martial‐law deadline of August 2025, and the statutory 90-day campaign requirement, the true probability of a lawful announcement before July 1, 2025 is extremely low. Allowing a small tail for political surprise or legal reinterpretation, I assign about a 2% probability.

Outside View Prediction:  
2%

Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source Analysis  
- Kyiv Independent (Feb 19, 2025): High‐quality Ukrainian independent outlet. Provides the current legal framework: martial law bans elections, the CEC needs 90 days after it’s lifted, and martial law requires a peace settlement. Factual material distinguishes law (ban on elections) from expert opinions (Aivazovska, Venislavskyi).  
- VOA News (Feb 28, 2025): U.S. government–funded broadcaster, broadly reliable. Cites Ukrainian and U.S. lawmakers, CEC experts, and NGOs. Factual points include constitutional prohibition under martial law, displacement figures, logistical impossibility. Opinions are clearly attributed to experts (Radchenko, Aivazovska).  
- Al Jazeera (Apr 8, 2025): Internationally recognized. Confirms legal/logistical obstacles: demobilization needs, security of polling stations, damaged infrastructure. Mixture of quoted statistics and expert statements; opinion sections are marked and attributable.  
- Perplexity Report: Comprehensive constitutional and historical analysis. Cites primary documents (Constitution, Electoral Code, Martial Law Act) and past precedents (1994, 2004, 2014). Likely high reliability on constitutional timelines but second‐hand sourcing from language models means we treat it as secondary.  
- FPRI (2019) & Politico (2013) & Wilson Center (Nov 2024): While credible, these pre‐2022 or U.S.‐focused sources offer little direct insight into the current martial‐law constraints and are of limited relevance beyond procedural background (e.g., typical lead times).

2. Reference‐Class Analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
  a. Elections held under martial law (global): Essentially zero precedents at scale—martial‐law bans are universal.  
  b. Snap Ukrainian elections (1994, 2014): Both occurred under very different circumstances (no nationwide martial law), with parliament quickly scheduling elections within 60–90 days. Not comparable legally or logistically.  
  c. Conflict‐postponed elections in wartime democracies (e.g., Lebanon civil war, Cambodia under UNTAC): Often delayed indefinitely until peace conditions. Announcements occur only after sustained ceasefires/peace processes.  

Most suitable: “Conflict‐postponed elections” reference class, where countries under extensive hostilities and martial‐law–equivalent provisions do not announce election dates until well after a peace settlement. The base rate in that class for announcing an election date while fighting continues is near zero.

3. Timeframe Analysis  
- Forecast horizon: ~45 days (May 16–July 1, 2025).  
- Constitutional/legislative minimum: lifting martial law → CEC launch → 90‐day campaign → election date announcement. Announcements of the election date would need to occur at least 90 days before the vote. Even if martial law were lifted tomorrow, the earliest legally possible announcement would be mid‐August for a November vote.  
- Putin’s invasion ongoing; recent parliamentary extension of martial law runs to August 2025. No signs of lifting before July. Historically, no announcements under similar time pressure and legal constraint.

4. Justification  
- Legal Constraint: Martial law (in place since Feb 2022 and extended to Aug 2025) expressly prohibits elections. No legal mechanism to override that without a peace settlement.  
- Political Consensus: Both Zelensky’s party and major opposition agree elections require lifted martial law and lasting peace. Parliament itself reaffirmed a six‐month delay post‐martial‐law.  
- Logistical Impossibility: Over 14 million displaced/abroad, damaged infrastructure, impossible to register and secure access. Even planning for diaspora voting or electronic voting has failed at smaller scales (Diia app).  
- Base Rate: In conflict settings with martial‐law bans, announcements do not occur until hostilities end—base rate near zero.  
- Time Constraints: Only 45 days to July 1, but legal minimum timelines demand at least 90 days’ notice post-lifting.  

Given these factors, there is a very low outside‐view probability of an announcement by July 1, 2025.

Outside view calibration:
- Base‐rate anchor: ~0% in similar martial‐law conflict cases.
- Adjustments: small nonzero chance for a political surprise or legal workaround, but virtually no credible path in 45 days.
- Final calibrated probability: 2%.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 2% chance that Ukraine will officially announce a presidential election date before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A.  Source analysis  
1. Kyiv Independent “Elections in Ukraine — a guide…” (Feb 2025)  
   • Factual content: constitutional ban on elections during martial law; sequence (lift ML → CEC starts campaign → vote 90 days later); scale of displacement/territorial occupation.  
   • Opinions: MPs, NGO leaders explaining why martial law cannot yet be lifted. These are identifiable insiders and sector experts (reasonable weight).  
   • Quality: high. Domestic outlet with a reputation for factual accuracy; most statements easily cross-checked with Ukrainian law and UN data.

2. VOA “Perspectives, challenges of Ukraine’s next election” (Feb 2025)  
   • Factual: poll showing 63 % oppose wartime elections; quotations from U.S. lawmakers, OSCE, Ukrainian election officials.  
   • Opinions: U.S. politicians exerting pressure—useful to gauge external incentives but low weight for ground-truth feasibility.  
   • Quality: generally reliable U.S. public broadcaster; cites named experts.

3. Al Jazeera (Apr 2025)  
   • Factual: restates legal prohibition, size of front line, displaced voters; cites KIIS and Rozumkov polls.  
   • Opinions: “hardly possible” quote by ex-CEC deputy (relevant); rumours of preparations refuted by ruling-party chief (valuable).  
   • Quality: good but some colour language; numbers broadly match UN / Ukrainian government data.

4. Wilson Center (Nov 2024)  
   • Mainly records reactions to Trump’s U.S. win; limited direct relevance, except to show outside political pressure exists.  
   • Quality: high; think-tank brief with named Ukrainian officials.

5. Perplexity historical-context report  
   • Synthesises constitutional provisions and precedent since 1991; cites specific constitutional articles.  
   • Quality: secondary compilation; fact pattern aligns with Ukrainian constitution and past election dates, but individual citations not independently verified here. Reasonable as a structural overview.

6–7. 2013 Politico & 2019 FPRI pieces  
   • Provide precedents of snap / ordinary elections under normal conditions. Useful mainly for timing rules (100–130 day lead time).  
   • Quality: reputable outlets; limited bearing on wartime constraints.

B.  Reference-class analysis  
Candidates considered:  
i) All Ukrainian presidential cycles since 1991 (ordinary & snap).  
   – Good sample size (7 elections) but none held under martial law; not comparable.  
ii) Cases worldwide where a country under active full-scale invasion + formal martial law nonetheless announced a nationwide presidential election while the war continued.  
   – Very small; examples (South Korea 1952, Lebanon 1988) show announcements typically tied to constitutional crisis or U.S. pressure, not a blanket legal ban.  
iii) Ukraine itself after Feb 2022 while under martial law (parliamentary & presidential cycles postponed).  
   – Exact institutional match; sample size small but the relevant statistic is 0 announcements in 39 months.  
iv) Any democracy that constitutionally bans elections under martial law and has not terminated martial law.  
   – Again tiny sample; base rate close to zero.

Suitability: The best fit is (iii) “Ukraine under current martial-law regime” supplemented by (ii) “states with legal wartime bans.” Both point to a very low baseline probability.

C.  Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 16 May 2025. Time until question deadline: 46 days.  
• Historical pattern: Ukrainian law stipulates at least 90 days between lifting martial law and the vote. Even if martial law were lifted tomorrow, the CEC must first start the campaign; that announcement is part of the election call. With only 46 days left, any compliant announcement would already be extra-legal unless parliament simultaneously amends multiple statutes—something that normally takes weeks and would be visible in advance. No bill of that nature is on the Rada docket; latest extension of martial law (24 Apr 2025) runs through 23 Aug 2025.

D.  Justification for outside-view probability  
• Base frequency under identical conditions (Ukraine 2022-25): 0/39 months → empirical rate ≈ 0 %.  
• Strong, explicit constitutional-statutory barrier + a very short runway left.  
• No credible reporting of an imminent peace deal that would lift martial law before 1 July. Saudi-brokered talks exclude Ukraine; Kyiv would not lift ML unilaterally.  
• Political incentives: 63 % of population and all major parties oppose wartime elections; Zelenskyy’s mandate still viewed as legally valid (Art 108). Therefore minimal domestic push.  
• External pressure (Trump, Putin) exists but is counter-balanced by EU/OSCE statements that credible elections are impossible now.  
• To overturn the legal ban, the Rada would have to (1) vote to lift martial law and (2) pass enabling amendments, both under severe time constraints and while frontline fighting continues.  
• Combining these factors yields an outside-view probability only marginally above absolute zero to allow for black-swan diplomatic breakthroughs or procedural surprises.

Outside view calibration:
A “black swan allowance” of roughly 3–5 % is standard for low-frequency geopolitical events with non-zero pathways (e.g., sudden armistice, constitutional override, or symbolic announcement ignoring the 90-day rule). There is no historical analogue inside Ukraine, but occasional wartime elections elsewhere (Korea 1952) show that surprises, though rare, do occur.  
Benchmark: In 39 months, zero announcements → empirical upper 95 % confidence limit using a Poisson(λ) model: λ ≤ 0.077 per month. Over the next 1.5 months the expected probability ≤ 0.115 ≈ 11 %. However that assumes stationarity; given shrinking time window and extended ML, the realistic probability is far lower—roughly one-third of that ceiling.  

Thus I calibrate the outside-view probability at 4 %.

Outside View Prediction:
4 % (i.e., roughly 1-in-25 chance that Ukraine announces a presidential election before 1 July 2025).

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Odessa Journal (May 2025)**: Recent credible reporting of Ukraine's parliament extending martial law and mobilization until August 7, 2025 with strong parliamentary support (357 votes for martial law extension).

2. **Charter97 (April 2025)**: Confirms the martial law extension and clearly states Ukrainian law prohibits elections during martial law. Provides factual legal context for restrictions under martial law.

3. **Reuters (April 2025)**: Reliable international source confirming parliament's 357-0 vote extending martial law through August 2025, explicitly noting Ukraine "must suspend its electoral calendar" while martial law is in effect.

4. **The Economist (November 2024)**: Older context about potential leadership challenges to Zelensky in 2025; contains more opinion than fact and predates recent martial law extensions.

5. **CNBCTV18 (November 2024)**: Reports on Trump's 2024 election victory and mentions potential U.S. pressure on Ukraine regarding elections, though mostly covers diplomatic congratulations.

6. **Deutsche Welle (February 2025)**: Provides expert analysis on election feasibility. Thomas Greminger (former OSCE Secretary General) is quoted estimating under 1% chance of a 2025 vote without certain preconditions. John Herbst (former US Ambassador) notes elections would be "dangerous" under current conditions.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence against election announcement before July 1:**
- Multiple reliable sources (Reuters, Odessa Journal, Charter97) confirm martial law extension through August 7, 2025, beyond our forecast window
- Ukrainian law explicitly prohibits elections during martial law (Charter97, Reuters)
- The parliamentary vote was nearly unanimous (357-0 according to Reuters)
- Thomas Greminger, with significant relevant expertise as former OSCE Secretary General, estimates <1% chance of 2025 elections without specific preconditions (DW)

**Moderate evidence of external pressure:**
- Keith Kellogg (US Special Envoy) expressed U.S. desire for Ukraine to hold elections "potentially before end of year" (DW)
- Putin questioning Zelensky's legitimacy may increase pressure (DW)
- Trump's characterization of Zelensky as a "dictator" adds political pressure (Reuters)

**Weak evidence for possible change:**
- Peace talks mentioned (Reuters) could theoretically lead to ceasefire and lifting of martial law
- Opposition figures beginning to challenge Zelensky more openly (Reuters)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The forecast period is May 16 to July 1, 2025 – approximately 45 days.

This timeframe is critical because:
- Martial law is legally extended until August 7, 2025, which is beyond our forecast window
- For an election announcement to occur, either:
  1. Ukraine would need to announce elections while martial law is active (illegal under current law), or
  2. Martial law would need to be suddenly lifted AND elections announced in this 45-day window

If the timeframe were halved to ~23 days, probability would decrease further as it allows even less time for the significant legal and political changes required.

If doubled to ~90 days, probability would increase slightly as it would extend beyond the current martial law period, though constitutional requirements would still present barriers.

## (d) Justification

The probability of Ukraine announcing presidential elections before July 1, 2025 is extremely low for several compelling reasons:

1. **Legal impossibility**: Martial law has been formally extended until August 7, 2025 (past our forecast window), and Ukrainian law explicitly prohibits elections during martial law.

2. **Strong institutional consensus**: The parliamentary vote extending martial law was nearly unanimous (357-0), showing strong cross-party support for maintaining martial law.

3. **Expert assessment**: Thomas Greminger, former OSCE Secretary General with specific election expertise, estimates less than 1% chance of a 2025 vote without significant preconditions.

4. **Timeline constraints**: Even if martial law were suddenly lifted, constitutional requirements would likely delay any election announcement beyond July 1.

5. **Ongoing war reality**: Active conflict continues, with recent Russian strikes on Sumy and Kryvyi Rih (Reuters), making election conditions impractical.

The only plausible scenario for an announcement would require an extraordinary and rapid peace settlement, immediate lifting of martial law, and abandonment of normal constitutional timelines – all extremely unlikely within 45 days.

## Probability calibration

The outside view analysis produced a 1% probability estimate, which aligns with expert assessment from Thomas Greminger (former OSCE Secretary General).

Examining the current evidence, I see no reason to adjust this probability:
- The martial law extension through August 7 was just confirmed on May 9, 2025 (Odessa Journal)
- The parliamentary vote was overwhelmingly supportive (357-0)
- No credible source suggests Ukraine is considering violating its own constitution by announcing elections during martial law
- The 45-day timeframe is too short for the dramatic changes required

While external pressure exists from both the U.S. and Russia, Ukrainian authorities have consistently prioritized their constitutional framework. The recent extension of martial law directly contradicts the idea that Ukraine might announce elections in the immediate future.

I maintain a 1% probability estimate, primarily accounting for the remote possibility of an extraordinary peace settlement that might trigger emergency changes to the legal framework.

## Checklist:
1. Resolution criteria: Will Ukraine's government officially announce a specific presidential election date before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view base rate: 1% based on expert assessment and legal prohibitions
3. Consistency: 1 out of 100 times, Ukraine announces elections before July 1, 2025 despite legal barriers
4. Key evidence: Martial law extended to August 7; Elections prohibited during martial law; Parliamentary consensus (357-0 vote); Expert assessment of <1% probability
5. Blind spot: Sudden peace deal with immediate lifting of martial law
6. Status quo: No election announcements during martial law has been consistent pattern

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source analysis:

1. **Odessa Journal (May 9, 2025)**: Recent local reporting confirming Ukraine's parliament extended martial law and mobilization until August 7, 2025 with overwhelming support (357 votes for martial law extension).

2. **Charter97 (April 18, 2025)**: Belarus-based opposition outlet reporting President Zelensky signed these extension laws. Importantly documents that under martial law, Ukraine legally prohibits "constitutional amendments, dissolution of parliament, and elections."

3. **Reuters (April 16, 2025)**: Highly credible international source confirming the 357-0 parliamentary vote extending martial law through August 2025. Notes that under martial law, Ukraine "must suspend its electoral calendar" and that "new elections are legally barred."

4. **The Economist (November 12, 2024)**: Six-month-old reporting on domestic political pressures but contains limited direct relevance to election announcements.

5. **CNBCTV18 (November 5, 2024)**: Coverage of Trump's 2024 election victory, mentioning that "Trump aides have floated a peace deal ceding eastern Ukraine and Crimea to Russia." Expert opinion from John Bolton warns about Trump's leadership style affecting Ukraine policy.

6. **Deutsche Welle (February 8, 2025)**: Reputable German international broadcaster reporting Zelensky's statement that elections will only be announced once "the hot phase of the war ends and martial law is lifted." Includes expert opinions:
   - Thomas Greminger (former OSCE Secretary General): Estimates <1% chance of a 2025 vote, citing impossibility under current conditions
   - John Herbst (former US Ambassador): Warns against premature elections
   - Keith Kellogg (US Special Envoy): States US desires elections potentially before end of 2025

## (b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence:**
1. Legal prohibition: Multiple independent sources (Reuters, Charter97, DW) confirm that martial law explicitly prohibits elections in Ukraine.
2. Recent official action: Parliament voted 357-0 to extend martial law until August 7, 2025, beyond our July 1 deadline (Odessa Journal, Reuters).
3. Constitutional framework: Even if martial law were lifted, Ukraine requires at least 90 days between announcement and elections (implied by sources).

**Moderate evidence:**
1. Presidential position: Zelensky explicitly stated in February 2025 that elections will only be announced after martial law is lifted (DW).
2. Expert assessment: Thomas Greminger (former OSCE Secretary General) assessed the likelihood of 2025 elections at <1% due to legal and practical impossibilities.

**Weak evidence:**
1. International pressure: Trump administration and Russia pushing for elections (DW, CNBCTV18) could create pressure but doesn't overcome legal barriers.
2. Domestic political dynamics: Possible leadership challenges (Economist) provide limited indication of imminent electoral announcements.

## (c) Timeframe analysis:

Current timeframe: From May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025 = approximately 45 days

This is significant because:
1. Martial law extends through August 7, 2025, covering our entire forecast period
2. Even if martial law were unexpectedly lifted immediately, the implied 90-day notice requirement would push any election announcement beyond July 1

If the timeframe were halved (22 days): Probability would remain essentially unchanged due to the same legal barriers applying with even less time for extraordinary changes.

If the timeframe were doubled (90 days): Probability would increase slightly but remain very low, as this would extend beyond the current martial law period, potentially allowing for peace developments and lifting of martial law.

## (d) Justification:

The outside view probability of 2% appears reasonable based on:

1. **Insurmountable legal barriers**: Ukraine's martial law explicitly prohibits elections and has been extended past our deadline with near-unanimous parliamentary support (357-0 vote).

2. **No viable timeframe**: Even in an extraordinary scenario where martial law is lifted immediately, the standard 90-day notice period for elections would push any announcement beyond July 1.

3. **Official position alignment**: Zelensky's stated position (elections only after martial law ends) aligns with the legal requirements, showing no intent to circumvent them.

4. **Ongoing war reality**: Recent Russian offensives mentioned in sources suggest no imminent end to conditions requiring martial law.

5. **Expert consensus**: Multiple expert sources, including former OSCE Secretary General, assess meaningful elections as practically impossible under current conditions.

The only possible pathway would require Ukraine to violate its own constitution and laws by announcing elections while martial law remains in effect, which would undermine the legitimacy of both the current and future government. This scenario has vanishingly small probability.

## Probability calibration

The outside view prediction of 2% was based on historical precedent (zero elections announced under martial law) with a small allowance for unexpected political developments.

The inside view analysis confirms this low probability is appropriate:
- Legal prohibition is explicit and reinforced by recent parliamentary action (357-0 vote)
- Martial law extends beyond our deadline (until August 7, 2025)
- Procedural requirements make it practically impossible within our timeframe
- No evidence of political will to change this framework
- Expert assessments align with this extremely low probability

I will maintain the 2% probability as it appropriately captures the remote but non-zero chance of an extraordinary scenario (such as sudden war conclusion or external pressure leading to constitutional crisis).

## Checklist:
1. Ukraine must officially announce a presidential election date before July 1, 2025, through authorized government agencies.
2. Outside view base rate: 2% (zero historical precedent with small allowance for surprises)
3. Consistency: 2 out of 100 times, Ukraine announces elections before July 1 despite legal barriers.
4. Key evidence: Martial law extended to August 2025; elections explicitly prohibited under martial law; 90-day notice requirement; Zelensky's statement elections only after martial law ends
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Russian collapse leading to immediate peace and martial law lifting
6. Status quo: No election announcements under martial law for 3+ years; pattern likely to continue

Probability: 2%
Predicted Probability: 2.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will Ukraine officially announce the date of its next presidential election before July 1, 2025? Under current law, any presidential vote must be announced at least 90–100 days in advance—and elections are barred while martial law is in effect.  

2. Source analysis  
a. Odessa Journal (May 9, 2025): Reliable Ukrainian outlet reporting Verkhovna Rada extended martial law and general mobilization to August 7, 2025 (357–0 vote). Factual, date-stamped, directly relevant.  
b. Charter97/RBC-Ukraine (Apr 18–May 9, 2025): Confirms the same extension via presidential signature and details martial-law restrictions (no elections, bans on rallies or constitutional changes). High reliability, contemporaneous.  
c. Reuters (Apr 16, 2025): Independent confirmation of extension to August 2025; explains legal bar on elections under martial law. Strong global wire.  
d. Deutsche Welle (Feb 8, 2025): Quotes Zelensky that elections await “end of hot phase” and lifting of martial law; cites multiple experts (Herbst, Greminger) judging 2025 vote under 1%. Credible, expert-heavy.  
e. Kyiv Independent (Feb 19, 2025): Legal breakdown: martial-law ban, 90-day lead time post-lift, displacement figures. Well-sourced, specialist outlet.  
f. Voice of America (Feb 28, 2025): Poll: 63% of Ukrainians oppose wartime elections; cites former CEC deputy and U.S. congressional views. Strong methodology, clear sourcing.  
g. Al Jazeera (Apr 8, 2025): Polling (Zelensky 74% approval), logistical hurdles (700K troops, destroyed infrastructure), “six months post–martial law” timeline. Well-researched, recent.  
h. Perplexity report (2025): Summarizes Ukrainian electoral code and martial-law legislation—ban on elections, structural procedures. Detailed legal citations.  

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
- Strong  
  • Multiple sources agree martial law bars elections until lifted (Odessa Journal; Reuters; Charter97).  
  • Legal requirement of 90+ days’ notice plus officials’ statements calling for six-month delay (Kyiv Independent; Al Jazeera).  
  • DW expert consensus that credible elections require ceasefire and territorial control (Herbst; Greminger).  
- Moderate  
  • Public opposition to wartime elections (63% from VOA).  
  • Logistical barriers of displaced populations and destroyed infrastructure (Al Jazeera).  
- Weak  
  • External political pressure (Trump/Putin) – speculative and insufficient to override domestic legal/operational constraints.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: ~45 days (May 16 to July 1, 2025).  
– If window were half (≈22 days), probability would be even lower given the time needed to lift martial law and set an election date.  
– If doubled (≈90 days), probability would rise modestly, but still be low because martial law is fixed until August. Only an unexpected early termination of martial law would permit an announcement—and current extensions make that unlikely.  

5. Justification of inside view shift  
Outside-view base rate for elections announced under martial law in war: effectively 0–5%. Current information cements a near-zero probability:  
– Martial law is legally extended to August 2025, past the cutoff date (Strong).  
– Even after martial law ends, officials plan a six-month preparation period, not the minimum 90 days (Strong).  
– Broad domestic and expert consensus opposes elections amid active conflict; public polls resist wartime vote (Strong/Moderate).  
– Logistical impossibilities (troop participation, displaced voters, destroyed polling stations) (Moderate).  

To reach a >5% chance, we would need a sudden peace treaty in May–June 2025 that immediately ends martial law and triggers an expedited election announcement—an extreme, low-probability scenario.  

Probability calibration  
Given the legal bar until August and the procedural and political consensus, an announcement before July 1, 2025 is nearly impossible. I assign 1%.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrased question correctly.  
2. Outside-view base rate (elections under martial law) ≈ 0–5%; final grounded in that.  
3. “1 out of 100 times, Ukraine announces an election date under these conditions.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Martial law extended to August 2025.  
   • Legal 90-day+ notice and six-month official timeline.  
   • Expert/public consensus against wartime elections.  
5. Blind spot: Sudden, comprehensive peace deal in June forcing immediate elections—very unlikely.  
6. Status quo: Martial law continues; world changes slowly—status quo highly favored.  

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Odessa Journal (May 9): Reliable local outlet; reports Verkhovna Rada extended martial law/mobilization to August 7, 2025. Factual vote counts; no opinions. Strong.  
• Charter97/RBC-Ukraine (Apr 18): High-quality summary; confirms 15th renewal of martial law to August 6; outlines legal powers under martial law, including election ban. Factual; strong.  
• Reuters (Apr 16): Global standard; reports unanimous extension through August, cites legal suspension of elections under martial law and no election date announced. Factual; strong.  
• The Economist (Nov 12 2024): Credible; notes weakening morale and speculation about leadership change but no hard evidence on election timing. Opinion/analysis; moderate.  
• DW (Feb 8 2025): Authoritative; quotes Zelensky’s condition (“after hot phase ends and martial law lifted”) and experts unanimously doubting credible 2025 vote. Mix of factual quotes and expert opinions; strong.  
• U.S. election coverage (Nov 5 2024): Peripheral; informs U.S. political backdrop (Trump victory), noting U.S. pressure for Ukraine elections but no immediate legal consequences. Secondary; weak.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
 – Legal ban: Martial law extensions explicitly bar elections until lifted; 15 renewals signal entrenched status quo.  
 – Institutional timelines: CEC needs 90 days after martial law ends to schedule; martial law runs to August.  
 – Expert consensus: DW-cited experts (OSCE, Atlantic Council) all assign near-zero chance of contemporary elections.  
Moderate evidence  
 – Political incentives: U.S. and Russian leaders publicly call for elections, but Ukrainian leadership uniformly resists until peace; no sign of shift.  
 – Historical precedents: Other war-delayed elections globally postpone announcements until sustained peace.  
Weak evidence  
 – Media speculation (Economist) on power struggles; no firm timeline.  
 – Peripheral U.S. domestic politics; little direct impact on Ukraine’s legal procedures within 45 days.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
– Forecast horizon: 46 days (May 16–July 1, 2025).  
– Minimum legal runway: Even if martial law were lifted immediately (unlikely before August), earliest legally valid announcement would be mid-August for a fourth-quarter vote, missing July 1.  
– If timeframe halved (~23 days), still impossible; if doubled (~92 days), still overlaps current martial law, which expires August 6–7 (with no sign of early termination).

(d) Justification  
1. Structural constraint: Martial law legally prohibits setting election date. Extension to August makes pre-July announcement infeasible.  
2. Institutional inertia: Parliament and President require peace/ceasefire guarantees before lifting martial law; no credible peace progress yet.  
3. Logistical barriers: Millions displaced, damaged infrastructure, security risks render rapid electoral planning impossible.  
4. Base-rate anchor: In conflict/martial-law cases, election-date announcements before hostilities end approach 0%.  
5. Political dynamics: Despite external pressure (U.S., Russia), Ukraine’s leadership uniformly prioritizes security and constitutional integrity over premature elections.

Probability calibration  
Outside-view base rate in martial-law conflict settings: ~0–1%.  
Adjustments:  
+1% for remote political surprise (e.g., shock peace deal enabling immediate legal tweaks).  
Final inside-view probability: 2%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Ukraine officially announce a presidential election date before July 1, 2025, given martial law in force until August 2025?  
2. Base rate: ~0–1% in analogous martial-law, war-delayed elections.  
3. Consistency: “2 out of 100 times, Ukraine announces a date under these conditions.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Martial law extension blocks elections (strong).  
   – 90-day CEC timeline post-martial-law (strong).  
   – Expert near-zero chance assessments (strong).  
   – No credible ceasefire or legal change before July (moderate).  
5. Blind spot: A sudden, unexpected peace accord or parliamentary decision to lift martial law early would invalidate assumptions; this remains low probability but merits slight upward shift.  
6. Status quo: Martial law extended, no previous election date announcements; high inertia toward no announcement.

Probability: 2%
Predicted Probability: 2.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Odessa-Journal, 9 May 2025 ‒ Factual Rada vote numbers and new end-date of martial law (Aug 7 2025). Local Ukrainian outlet; data verifiable in the Rada roll-call. Very high reliability for the hard facts; no opinions.  
2. Charter 97 / RBC-Ukraine, 18 Apr 2025 ‒ Same extension, plus outline of powers under martial law. Facts match #1; minor opinion (“15th time renewed”) is descriptive. Reliable for legal facts, medium for political colour.  
3. Reuters, 16 Apr 2025 ‒ International wire, confirms extension and reiterates constitutional ban on elections. Adds quotes on foreign pressure (Trump, Putin). High reliability; clearly separates fact vs. attributed opinion.  
4. DW, 8 Feb 2025 ‒ Longform analysis quoting named experts (Kellogg, Herbst, Greminger) that wartime elections are “dangerous” or “nearly impossible.” Good quality; opinions are from identifiable specialists.  
5. Economist, 12 Nov 2024 ‒ Background on looming “power struggle”; mostly narrative, little hard data. Medium reliability; useful only for sentiment.  
6. CNBCTV18 liveblog, 5 Nov 2024 ‒ Records Trump’s U.S. victory; contains claim that Trump wants Kyiv elections. Fact (Trump elected) reliable, policy inference speculative.  

(b) Evidence analysis (relative weight toward a “Yes” announcement)  
Strong negative evidence  
• Martial-law extension to 7 Aug 2025 (Sources 1–3). –Structural, legal, multi-source confirmation.  
• Ukrainian constitution bans elections under martial law; election timetable requires ≥90 days prep (Sources 2,3,4). –Institutional, hard to amend quickly.  
• Only 46 days remain to 1 Jul 2025. –Temporal, deterministic.  

Moderate positive evidence  
• Repeated public pressure from U.S. administration and Russia to schedule elections (Sources 3,4,6). –Identifiable, but indirect.  
• Zelenskyy remark (Piers Morgan interview, Feb 2025) that an election “will be announced once the hot phase ends.” –Shows theoretical willingness if battlefield conditions change fast.  

Weak evidence  
• Economist talk of “power struggle” and domestic restlessness. –Anecdotal, nine months old.  
• Rumours of Rada contingency planning (no primary citation). –Speculative.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Countdown: 46 days to question deadline.  
• If the window were doubled (92 days), probability would rise modestly (to ~6 %) because Rada could first repeal martial law and then announce.  
• If halved (23 days), probability would fall to ~1 %: simply no legislative time.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (Ukraine under current martial law since 2022): 0 announcements in 39 months ≈ 4 %.  
Downward adjustments  
–Fresh 90-day extension moves legal earliest end of martial law past the deadline (strong –8 pts).  
–Only 46 days left eliminates standard 90-day campaign requirement (strong –4 pts).  
Upward nudges  
+Small but non-zero “shock ceasefire / political gamble” scenario where Rada rescinds martial law early and immediately calls an October-2025 vote (weak +1 pt).  
+Foreign-policy pressure from Washington/Moscow that could trigger a symbolic date-setting even before lifting martial law (very weak +0.5 pt).  

Net effect: 4 % –12 % +1.5 % ≈ 2–3 %. Rounded to 2 % to respect greater weight of structural negatives.

Probability calibration
My 2 % means: in 2 out of 100 parallel timelines an official Ukrainian body names a specific presidential-election date before 1 July 2025. A ±10 percentage-point shift would imply either ignoring the hard legal/time constraints (if higher) or assuming zero possibility of a sudden ceasefire (if lower); both seem unjustified.

Checklist:  
1. Question restated: “By 1 Jul 2025 will Ukraine’s government publish a specific presidential-election date?” ✔  
2. Base rate: 4 % from 0 events in 39 months under martial law. ✔  
3. Consistency: “2 out of 100 times, an announcement occurs.” ✔  
4. Key evidence  
   – Rada extended martial law to 7 Aug 2025.  
   – Constitutional ban on elections under martial law.  
   – 90-day statutory campaign period.  
   – Only 46 days remain to deadline.  
   – External pressure (U.S./Russia) for elections. ✔  
5. Blind-spot: Rapid peace deal followed by Rada repealing martial law and announcing October-2025 vote in one extraordinary session. Would swing probability upward.  
6. Status-quo bias check: status quo = no announcement; most signals reinforce it. Small nudge toward “No” retained. ✔

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Odessa Journal (May 2025)**: Recent credible reporting of Ukraine's parliament extending martial law and mobilization until August 7, 2025 with strong parliamentary support (357 votes for martial law extension).

2. **Charter97 (April 2025)**: Confirms the martial law extension and clearly states Ukrainian law prohibits elections during martial law. Provides factual legal context for restrictions under martial law.

3. **Reuters (April 2025)**: Reliable international source confirming parliament's 357-0 vote extending martial law through August 2025, explicitly noting Ukraine "must suspend its electoral calendar" while martial law is in effect.

4. **The Economist (November 2024)**: Older context about potential leadership challenges to Zelensky in 2025; contains more opinion than fact and predates recent martial law extensions.

5. **CNBCTV18 (November 2024)**: Reports on Trump's 2024 election victory and mentions potential U.S. pressure on Ukraine regarding elections, though mostly covers diplomatic congratulations.

6. **Deutsche Welle (February 2025)**: Provides expert analysis on election feasibility. Thomas Greminger (former OSCE Secretary General) is quoted estimating under 1% chance of a 2025 vote without certain preconditions. John Herbst (former US Ambassador) notes elections would be "dangerous" under current conditions.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence against election announcement before July 1:**
- Multiple reliable sources (Reuters, Odessa Journal, Charter97) confirm martial law extension through August 7, 2025, beyond our forecast window
- Ukrainian law explicitly prohibits elections during martial law (Charter97, Reuters)
- The parliamentary vote was nearly unanimous (357-0 according to Reuters)
- Thomas Greminger, with significant relevant expertise as former OSCE Secretary General, estimates <1% chance of 2025 elections without specific preconditions (DW)

**Moderate evidence of external pressure:**
- Keith Kellogg (US Special Envoy) expressed U.S. desire for Ukraine to hold elections "potentially before end of year" (DW)
- Putin questioning Zelensky's legitimacy may increase pressure (DW)
- Trump's characterization of Zelensky as a "dictator" adds political pressure (Reuters)

**Weak evidence for possible change:**
- Peace talks mentioned (Reuters) could theoretically lead to ceasefire and lifting of martial law
- Opposition figures beginning to challenge Zelensky more openly (Reuters)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The forecast period is May 16 to July 1, 2025 – approximately 45 days.

This timeframe is critical because:
- Martial law is legally extended until August 7, 2025, which is beyond our forecast window
- For an election announcement to occur, either:
  1. Ukraine would need to announce elections while martial law is active (illegal under current law), or
  2. Martial law would need to be suddenly lifted AND elections announced in this 45-day window

If the timeframe were halved to ~23 days, probability would decrease further as it allows even less time for the significant legal and political changes required.

If doubled to ~90 days, probability would increase slightly as it would extend beyond the current martial law period, though constitutional requirements would still present barriers.

## (d) Justification

The probability of Ukraine announcing presidential elections before July 1, 2025 is extremely low for several compelling reasons:

1. **Legal impossibility**: Martial law has been formally extended until August 7, 2025 (past our forecast window), and Ukrainian law explicitly prohibits elections during martial law.

2. **Strong institutional consensus**: The parliamentary vote extending martial law was nearly unanimous (357-0), showing strong cross-party support for maintaining martial law.

3. **Expert assessment**: Thomas Greminger, former OSCE Secretary General with specific election expertise, estimates less than 1% chance of a 2025 vote without significant preconditions.

4. **Timeline constraints**: Even if martial law were suddenly lifted, constitutional requirements would likely delay any election announcement beyond July 1.

5. **Ongoing war reality**: Active conflict continues, with recent Russian strikes on Sumy and Kryvyi Rih (Reuters), making election conditions impractical.

The only plausible scenario for an announcement would require an extraordinary and rapid peace settlement, immediate lifting of martial law, and abandonment of normal constitutional timelines – all extremely unlikely within 45 days.

## Probability calibration

The outside view analysis produced a 1% probability estimate, which aligns with expert assessment from Thomas Greminger (former OSCE Secretary General).

Examining the current evidence, I see no reason to adjust this probability:
- The martial law extension through August 7 was just confirmed on May 9, 2025 (Odessa Journal)
- The parliamentary vote was overwhelmingly supportive (357-0)
- No credible source suggests Ukraine is considering violating its own constitution by announcing elections during martial law
- The 45-day timeframe is too short for the dramatic changes required

While external pressure exists from both the U.S. and Russia, Ukrainian authorities have consistently prioritized their constitutional framework. The recent extension of martial law directly contradicts the idea that Ukraine might announce elections in the immediate future.

I maintain a 1% probability estimate, primarily accounting for the remote possibility of an extraordinary peace settlement that might trigger emergency changes to the legal framework.

## Checklist:
1. Resolution criteria: Will Ukraine's government officially announce a specific presidential election date before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view base rate: 1% based on expert assessment and legal prohibitions
3. Consistency: 1 out of 100 times, Ukraine announces elections before July 1, 2025 despite legal barriers
4. Key evidence: Martial law extended to August 7; Elections prohibited during martial law; Parliamentary consensus (357-0 vote); Expert assessment of <1% probability
5. Blind spot: Sudden peace deal with immediate lifting of martial law
6. Status quo: No election announcements during martial law has been consistent pattern

Probability: 1%

1. International pressure: Trump administration and Russia pushing for elections (DW, CNBCTV18) could create pressure but doesn't overcome legal barriers.
2. Domestic political dynamics: Possible leadership challenges (Economist) provide limited indication of imminent electoral announcements.

## (c) Timeframe analysis:

Current timeframe: From May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025 = approximately 45 days

This is significant because:
1. Martial law extends through August 7, 2025, covering our entire forecast period
2. Even if martial law were unexpectedly lifted immediately, the implied 90-day notice requirement would push any election announcement beyond July 1

If the timeframe were halved (22 days): Probability would remain essentially unchanged due to the same legal barriers applying with even less time for extraordinary changes.

If the timeframe were doubled (90 days): Probability would increase slightly but remain very low, as this would extend beyond the current martial law period, potentially allowing for peace developments and lifting of martial law.

## (d) Justification:

The outside view probability of 2% appears reasonable based on:

1. **Insurmountable legal barriers**: Ukraine's martial law explicitly prohibits elections and has been extended past our deadline with near-unanimous parliamentary support (357-0 vote).

2. **No viable timeframe**: Even in an extraordinary scenario where martial law is lifted immediately, the standard 90-day notice period for elections would push any announcement beyond July 1.

3. **Official position alignment**: Zelensky's stated position (elections only after martial law ends) aligns with the legal requirements, showing no intent to circumvent them.

4. **Ongoing war reality**: Recent Russian offensives mentioned in sources suggest no imminent end to conditions requiring martial law.

5. **Expert consensus**: Multiple expert sources, including former OSCE Secretary General, assess meaningful elections as practically impossible under current conditions.

The only possible pathway would require Ukraine to violate its own constitution and laws by announcing elections while martial law remains in effect, which would undermine the legitimacy of both the current and future government. This scenario has vanishingly small probability.

## Probability calibration

The outside view prediction of 2% was based on historical precedent (zero elections announced under martial law) with a small allowance for unexpected political developments.

The inside view analysis confirms this low probability is appropriate:
- Legal prohibition is explicit and reinforced by recent parliamentary action (357-0 vote)
- Martial law extends beyond our deadline (until August 7, 2025)
- Procedural requirements make it practically impossible within our timeframe
- No evidence of political will to change this framework
- Expert assessments align with this extremely low probability

I will maintain the 2% probability as it appropriately captures the remote but non-zero chance of an extraordinary scenario (such as sudden war conclusion or external pressure leading to constitutional crisis).

## Checklist:
1. Ukraine must officially announce a presidential election date before July 1, 2025, through authorized government agencies.
2. Outside view base rate: 2% (zero historical precedent with small allowance for surprises)
3. Consistency: 2 out of 100 times, Ukraine announces elections before July 1 despite legal barriers.
4. Key evidence: Martial law extended to August 2025; elections explicitly prohibited under martial law; 90-day notice requirement; Zelensky's statement elections only after martial law ends
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Russian collapse leading to immediate peace and martial law lifting
6. Status quo: No election announcements under martial law for 3+ years; pattern likely to continue

Probability: 2%
Predicted Probability: 2.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will Ukraine officially announce the date of its next presidential election before July 1, 2025? Under current law, any presidential vote must be announced at least 90–100 days in advance—and elections are barred while martial law is in effect.  

2. Source analysis  
a. Odessa Journal (May 9, 2025): Reliable Ukrainian outlet reporting Verkhovna Rada extended martial law and general mobilization to August 7, 2025 (357–0 vote). Factual, date-stamped, directly relevant.  
b. Charter97/RBC-Ukraine (Apr 18–May 9, 2025): Confirms the same extension via presidential signature and details martial-law restrictions (no elections, bans on rallies or constitutional changes). High reliability, contemporaneous.  
c. Reuters (Apr 16, 2025): Independent confirmation of extension to August 2025; explains legal bar on elections under martial law. Strong global wire.  
d. Deutsche Welle (Feb 8, 2025): Quotes Zelensky that elections await “end of hot phase” and lifting of martial law; cites multiple experts (Herbst, Greminger) judging 2025 vote under 1%. Credible, expert-heavy.  
e. Kyiv Independent (Feb 19, 2025): Legal breakdown: martial-law ban, 90-day lead time post-lift, displacement figures. Well-sourced, specialist outlet.  
f. Voice of America (Feb 28, 2025): Poll: 63% of Ukrainians oppose wartime elections; cites former CEC deputy and U.S. congressional views. Strong methodology, clear sourcing.  
g. Al Jazeera (Apr 8, 2025): Polling (Zelensky 74% approval), logistical hurdles (700K troops, destroyed infrastructure), “six months post–martial law” timeline. Well-researched, recent.  
h. Perplexity report (2025): Summarizes Ukrainian electoral code and martial-law legislation—ban on elections, structural procedures. Detailed legal citations.  

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
- Strong  
  • Multiple sources agree martial law bars elections until lifted (Odessa Journal; Reuters; Charter97).  
  • Legal requirement of 90+ days’ notice plus officials’ statements calling for six-month delay (Kyiv Independent; Al Jazeera).  
  • DW expert consensus that credible elections require ceasefire and territorial control (Herbst; Greminger).  
- Moderate  
  • Public opposition to wartime elections (63% from VOA).  
  • Logistical barriers of displaced populations and destroyed infrastructure (Al Jazeera).  
- Weak  
  • External political pressure (Trump/Putin) – speculative and insufficient to override domestic legal/operational constraints.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: ~45 days (May 16 to July 1, 2025).  
– If window were half (≈22 days), probability would be even lower given the time needed to lift martial law and set an election date.  
– If doubled (≈90 days), probability would rise modestly, but still be low because martial law is fixed until August. Only an unexpected early termination of martial law would permit an announcement—and current extensions make that unlikely.  

5. Justification of inside view shift  
Outside-view base rate for elections announced under martial law in war: effectively 0–5%. Current information cements a near-zero probability:  
– Martial law is legally extended to August 2025, past the cutoff date (Strong).  
– Even after martial law ends, officials plan a six-month preparation period, not the minimum 90 days (Strong).  
– Broad domestic and expert consensus opposes elections amid active conflict; public polls resist wartime vote (Strong/Moderate).  
– Logistical impossibilities (troop participation, displaced voters, destroyed polling stations) (Moderate).  

To reach a >5% chance, we would need a sudden peace treaty in May–June 2025 that immediately ends martial law and triggers an expedited election announcement—an extreme, low-probability scenario.  

Probability calibration  
Given the legal bar until August and the procedural and political consensus, an announcement before July 1, 2025 is nearly impossible. I assign 1%.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrased question correctly.  
2. Outside-view base rate (elections under martial law) ≈ 0–5%; final grounded in that.  
3. “1 out of 100 times, Ukraine announces an election date under these conditions.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Martial law extended to August 2025.  
   • Legal 90-day+ notice and six-month official timeline.  
   • Expert/public consensus against wartime elections.  
5. Blind spot: Sudden, comprehensive peace deal in June forcing immediate elections—very unlikely.  
6. Status quo: Martial law continues; world changes slowly—status quo highly favored.  

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%

Output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Odessa Journal (May 9): Reliable local outlet; reports Verkhovna Rada extended martial law/mobilization to August 7, 2025. Factual vote counts; no opinions. Strong.  
• Charter97/RBC-Ukraine (Apr 18): High-quality summary; confirms 15th renewal of martial law to August 6; outlines legal powers under martial law, including election ban. Factual; strong.  
• Reuters (Apr 16): Global standard; reports unanimous extension through August, cites legal suspension of elections under martial law and no election date announced. Factual; strong.  
• The Economist (Nov 12 2024): Credible; notes weakening morale and speculation about leadership change but no hard evidence on election timing. Opinion/analysis; moderate.  
• DW (Feb 8 2025): Authoritative; quotes Zelensky’s condition (“after hot phase ends and martial law lifted”) and experts unanimously doubting credible 2025 vote. Mix of factual quotes and expert opinions; strong.  
• U.S. election coverage (Nov 5 2024): Peripheral; informs U.S. political backdrop (Trump victory), noting U.S. pressure for Ukraine elections but no immediate legal consequences. Secondary; weak.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
 – Legal ban: Martial law extensions explicitly bar elections until lifted; 15 renewals signal entrenched status quo.  
 – Institutional timelines: CEC needs 90 days after martial law ends to schedule; martial law runs to August.  
 – Expert consensus: DW-cited experts (OSCE, Atlantic Council) all assign near-zero chance of contemporary elections.  
Moderate evidence  
 – Political incentives: U.S. and Russian leaders publicly call for elections, but Ukrainian leadership uniformly resists until peace; no sign of shift.  
 – Historical precedents: Other war-delayed elections globally postpone announcements until sustained peace.  
Weak evidence  
 – Media speculation (Economist) on power struggles; no firm timeline.  
 – Peripheral U.S. domestic politics; little direct impact on Ukraine’s legal procedures within 45 days.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
– Forecast horizon: 46 days (May 16–July 1, 2025).  
– Minimum legal runway: Even if martial law were lifted immediately (unlikely before August), earliest legally valid announcement would be mid-August for a fourth-quarter vote, missing July 1.  
– If timeframe halved (~23 days), still impossible; if doubled (~92 days), still overlaps current martial law, which expires August 6–7 (with no sign of early termination).

(d) Justification  
1. Structural constraint: Martial law legally prohibits setting election date. Extension to August makes pre-July announcement infeasible.  
2. Institutional inertia: Parliament and President require peace/ceasefire guarantees before lifting martial law; no credible peace progress yet.  
3. Logistical barriers: Millions displaced, damaged infrastructure, security risks render rapid electoral planning impossible.  
4. Base-rate anchor: In conflict/martial-law cases, election-date announcements before hostilities end approach 0%.  
5. Political dynamics: Despite external pressure (U.S., Russia), Ukraine’s leadership uniformly prioritizes security and constitutional integrity over premature elections.

Probability calibration  
Outside-view base rate in martial-law conflict settings: ~0–1%.  
Adjustments:  
+1% for remote political surprise (e.g., shock peace deal enabling immediate legal tweaks).  
Final inside-view probability: 2%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Ukraine officially announce a presidential election date before July 1, 2025, given martial law in force until August 2025?  
2. Base rate: ~0–1% in analogous martial-law, war-delayed elections.  
3. Consistency: “2 out of 100 times, Ukraine announces a date under these conditions.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Martial law extension blocks elections (strong).  
   – 90-day CEC timeline post-martial-law (strong).  
   – Expert near-zero chance assessments (strong).  
   – No credible ceasefire or legal change before July (moderate).  
5. Blind spot: A sudden, unexpected peace accord or parliamentary decision to lift martial law early would invalidate assumptions; this remains low probability but merits slight upward shift.  
6. Status quo: Martial law extended, no previous election date announcements; high inertia toward no announcement.

Probability: 2%
Predicted Probability: 2.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Odessa-Journal, 9 May 2025 ‒ Factual Rada vote numbers and new end-date of martial law (Aug 7 2025). Local Ukrainian outlet; data verifiable in the Rada roll-call. Very high reliability for the hard facts; no opinions.  
2. Charter 97 / RBC-Ukraine, 18 Apr 2025 ‒ Same extension, plus outline of powers under martial law. Facts match #1; minor opinion (“15th time renewed”) is descriptive. Reliable for legal facts, medium for political colour.  
3. Reuters, 16 Apr 2025 ‒ International wire, confirms extension and reiterates constitutional ban on elections. Adds quotes on foreign pressure (Trump, Putin). High reliability; clearly separates fact vs. attributed opinion.  
4. DW, 8 Feb 2025 ‒ Longform analysis quoting named experts (Kellogg, Herbst, Greminger) that wartime elections are “dangerous” or “nearly impossible.” Good quality; opinions are from identifiable specialists.  
5. Economist, 12 Nov 2024 ‒ Background on looming “power struggle”; mostly narrative, little hard data. Medium reliability; useful only for sentiment.  
6. CNBCTV18 liveblog, 5 Nov 2024 ‒ Records Trump’s U.S. victory; contains claim that Trump wants Kyiv elections. Fact (Trump elected) reliable, policy inference speculative.  

(b) Evidence analysis (relative weight toward a “Yes” announcement)  
Strong negative evidence  
• Martial-law extension to 7 Aug 2025 (Sources 1–3). –Structural, legal, multi-source confirmation.  
• Ukrainian constitution bans elections under martial law; election timetable requires ≥90 days prep (Sources 2,3,4). –Institutional, hard to amend quickly.  
• Only 46 days remain to 1 Jul 2025. –Temporal, deterministic.  

Moderate positive evidence  
• Repeated public pressure from U.S. administration and Russia to schedule elections (Sources 3,4,6). –Identifiable, but indirect.  
• Zelenskyy remark (Piers Morgan interview, Feb 2025) that an election “will be announced once the hot phase ends.” –Shows theoretical willingness if battlefield conditions change fast.  

Weak evidence  
• Economist talk of “power struggle” and domestic restlessness. –Anecdotal, nine months old.  
• Rumours of Rada contingency planning (no primary citation). –Speculative.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Countdown: 46 days to question deadline.  
• If the window were doubled (92 days), probability would rise modestly (to ~6 %) because Rada could first repeal martial law and then announce.  
• If halved (23 days), probability would fall to ~1 %: simply no legislative time.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (Ukraine under current martial law since 2022): 0 announcements in 39 months ≈ 4 %.  
Downward adjustments  
–Fresh 90-day extension moves legal earliest end of martial law past the deadline (strong –8 pts).  
–Only 46 days left eliminates standard 90-day campaign requirement (strong –4 pts).  
Upward nudges  
+Small but non-zero “shock ceasefire / political gamble” scenario where Rada rescinds martial law early and immediately calls an October-2025 vote (weak +1 pt).  
+Foreign-policy pressure from Washington/Moscow that could trigger a symbolic date-setting even before lifting martial law (very weak +0.5 pt).  

Net effect: 4 % –12 % +1.5 % ≈ 2–3 %. Rounded to 2 % to respect greater weight of structural negatives.

Probability calibration
My 2 % means: in 2 out of 100 parallel timelines an official Ukrainian body names a specific presidential-election date before 1 July 2025. A ±10 percentage-point shift would imply either ignoring the hard legal/time constraints (if higher) or assuming zero possibility of a sudden ceasefire (if lower); both seem unjustified.

Checklist:  
1. Question restated: “By 1 Jul 2025 will Ukraine’s government publish a specific presidential-election date?” ✔  
2. Base rate: 4 % from 0 events in 39 months under martial law. ✔  
3. Consistency: “2 out of 100 times, an announcement occurs.” ✔  
4. Key evidence  
   – Rada extended martial law to 7 Aug 2025.  
   – Constitutional ban on elections under martial law.  
   – 90-day statutory campaign period.  
   – Only 46 days remain to deadline.  
   – External pressure (U.S./Russia) for elections. ✔  
5. Blind-spot: Rapid peace deal followed by Rada repealing martial law and announcing October-2025 vote in one extraordinary session. Would swing probability upward.  
6. Status-quo bias check: status quo = no announcement; most signals reinforce it. Small nudge toward “No” retained. ✔

Probability: 2%
Predicted Probability: 2.0%...
