Analysis:
This question asks whether the Fed will announce any rate cut before July 1, 2025. To form an out-view baseline, we need historical patterns of Fed tightening cycles: how long the Fed typically waits after its last hike before cutting, what macro indicators (inflation, unemployment, GDP growth) signaled that cut, and how communication evolved within the FOMC. We also want to understand past Fed statements around pivot points, plus market-implied probabilities of cuts in 2025 for an inside view adjustment.

Current context LLM output:
Analysis:
We have roughly seven weeks until the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline and no rate cuts have yet been announced. The Fed paused at its May meeting and the dot‐plot median still shows no cuts until late 2025, while market‐implied probabilities (via Fed funds futures/CME FedWatch) assign a roughly 30–40% chance of at least one cut by July. Key incoming data to move the dial include April/May CPI and PCE inflation readings, May employment reports, GDP growth updates, and regional activity from the Beige Book. Equally crucial are signals from FOMC minutes, Fed Chair Powell and regional Fed presidents’ speeches, and any shifts in banking stress or financial conditions. To construct an inside‐view forecast, we need the latest news on Fed officials’ rate‐path guidance, the most recent FOMC minutes/highlights, updated Fed funds futures probabilities, and fresh inflation and labor‐market releases.

<Summary source="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/economy/fed-rate-decision-january">
Here are the key points from CNN’s January 29, 2025 article by Bryan Mena on the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts:

• Policy decision  
  – The Fed left its target federal funds rate at 4.25–4.50%, pausing cuts for now.  
  – In the new statement, officials dropped language saying inflation has “made progress.”  

• Inflation outlook  
  – Officials remain confident inflation will eventually hit the 2% target but see no quick victory.  
  – Powell said a sharp weakening in the labor market or a faster-than-expected slowdown in inflation would put cuts back on the table.  

• Labor market  
  – Unemployment stood at 4.1%; hiring remains “brisk,” though Powell described it as “a low-hiring environment.”  

• Trade-policy risks  
  – Trump’s promise of 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada (starting Feb 1), plus stricter immigration and energy policies, could rekindle inflation.  
  – The Fed is “studying up” on tariff history and will monitor enactment, duration, retaliation and transmission to consumers.  

• Political tensions  
  – Trump, at Davos, urged immediate rate cuts and later said he knows interest rates better than the Fed.  
  – Powell has had no contact with Trump since the inauguration and declined to comment on the president’s remarks.  
  – Powell reiterated the Fed’s independence and data-driven approach.  

• Market expectations  
  – Many investors still expect rate cuts in 2025; some see none; a few even price in further hikes.  
  – For now, markets are betting on another hold at the Fed’s March meeting, unless incoming data show a sharp drop in early-year inflation.  

• Historical context  
  – Fed staffers’ 2018 “tealbook” simulations found one-time tariffs usually warrant “seeing through” higher prices, but retaliatory actions that lift inflation expectations could justify rate hikes.  

• Inflation expectations  
  – Recent consumer surveys show a modest rise in year-ahead inflation expectations, likely driven by uncertainty over Trump’s policies—though they remain “in check,” per Powell.

Here’s a concise summary of the USA TODAY article “What Fed is (likely) waiting for before lowering interest rates”:

1. Fed’s May 7 stance  
   – Officials are expected to hold rates steady and stress they’re in “no hurry” to cut.  
   – They want “further clarity” on how President Trump’s tariffs affect inflation and employment.  

2. Economic data  
   – Q1 GDP contracted 0.3% annualized, largely because goods imports surged 50% annualized ahead of tariffs.  
   – Underlying U.S. demand remains solid:  
     • Consumer spending +1.8%  
     • Business investment +22.5%  
     • Final sales to domestic purchasers +2.3%  
   – Labor market: April added 177,000 jobs (155,000 average over prior three months); unemployment at 4.2%.  

3. Inflation readings  
   – Fed’s preferred inflation measure fell from 2.5% to 2.3%; core (ex food & energy) down from 2.8% to 2.6%.  
   – Still above the 2% target, and tariffs are expected to lift prices further. Barclays projects core inflation peaking at 3.8% in 2025.  

4. Fed’s dilemma and likely messaging  
   – Tariff-driven price increases alongside a strong labor market create stagflation risks.  
   – Fed Chair Powell has said if price stability and maximum employment conflict, the Fed will “adopt a balanced approach” but also “prioritize” keeping long-term inflation expectations anchored.  
   – Barclays expects Powell to emphasize price stability; Deutsche Bank says the Fed will wait for labor market softening before cutting rates.  

5. Forecasters’ rate-cut timing estimates  
   – Fed futures markets: first cut in July, three 25 bp cuts by year-end.  
   – Barclays: moved first cut from June to July, only one more in September.  
   – Morgan Stanley: no cuts until 2026 unless a recession hits.  
   – Goldman Sachs: cuts could start in July with three reductions if business uncertainty spurs weakness.  

6. Additional considerations  
   – Oxford Economics: inflation is the Fed’s priority since it’s farther from target than employment.  
   – Morgan Stanley notes that Trump’s immigration crackdown could slow labor-force growth, muting the rise in unemployment and delaying rate cuts even as inflation heats up.

<Summary source="https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts">
Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the March 3, 2025 J.P. Morgan Research note “What’s The Fed’s Next Move?”

1. FOMC decision (January 2025)
- Fed held the target federal funds rate at 4.25–4.50%, pausing its previous cutting cycle.
- Rationale: resilient labor market and “sticky” inflation.

2. Inflation data (January 2025)
- Headline CPI rose 0.5% month-over-month; core CPI (ex-food/energy) rose 0.4%.
- Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index (Fed’s preferred gauge): both headline and core PCE up 0.3% MoM, in line with expectations.
- Michael Feroli (J.P. Morgan Chief U.S. Economist): stronger CPI was driven by used vehicles and vehicle insurance, which carry less weight or different methodology in the PCE; thus, “we continue to see an avenue for inflation to moderate slightly in 2025.”

3. Consumer sentiment
- University of Michigan February survey: longer-term inflation expectations jumped to 3.5% (near pandemic highs).
- Buying-conditions perceptions deteriorated markedly, partly due to new tariff announcements.
- Feroli: “Elevated inflation expectations should reinforce the Fed’s extended pause in its rate-cutting campaign.”

4. J.P. Morgan’s forecast
- Fed will likely hold through June 2025, then deliver two rate cuts.
- Projected year-end 2025 policy rate range: 3.75–4.00%.

5. Fed Chair Jerome Powell (recent Congressional testimony)
- Expressed optimism about the U.S. economy.
- Indicated no hurry to cut; future cuts contingent on further inflation cooling or labor-market softening.

6. Risks & contingencies
- Upside risk of a rate hike if labor market overheats: Feroli notes a trigger could be unemployment falling below 4% combined with a vacancy-to-unemployment ratio above 1.3.
- Conversely, renewed labor-market weakness could prompt earlier cuts.
- Holding rates steady also reflects uncertainties around government policy (trade, immigration) and the wide consensus that current rates are appropriately restrictive to bring inflation back to target.

Disclaimer: this summary is based solely on the provided CCN.com article “Will US Tariffs Trigger a Recession in 2025? What Investors Need to Watch” (April 17, 2025).

Key facts and statistics  
• U.S. tariffs in 2025: 10% baseline on most imports, up to 145% on certain Chinese goods.  
• 2018 soybean example: exports to China fell 75%, from $12 billion in 2017 to $3 billion in 2018; African swine fever compounded the drop, collapsing futures and farmer incomes.  
• Historical market reaction: after Trump’s 2018 tariff announcements, the S&P 500 corrected by over 21%; in 2025 both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin saw >20% drops post-tariff news.  
• As of April 2025 the Fed’s target federal funds rate is 4.25–4.50%.  
• According to the CME FedWatch Tool (which infers expectations from futures pricing), over 86% of market participants expected no rate cut at the May 6–7, 2025 FOMC meeting.  
• The Fed’s “dot plot” projections (its own forecasts) foresee two rate cuts by year-end 2025.

Named or reliable sources  
• CME FedWatch Tool: used to gauge market odds of rate moves.  
• Federal Reserve projections (“dot plot”) for two cuts by end-2025.

Opinions and analysis (author or less-formal sources)  
• Tariffs heighten volatility and act as “accelerants” to downturns when economies already face stress (e.g., slowing growth, debt burdens, inflation uncertainty).  
• No sector is immune, but those most exposed include:  
  – Technology (complex global supply chains)  
  – Automotive (imported components)  
  – Agriculture (export-reliant crops, e.g., soybeans)  
  – Crypto infrastructure (hardware, global operations)  
• Investors are responding by:  
  – Rotating into defensive equities  
  – Increasing allocations to hard assets (Bitcoin, gold)  
  – Holding more cash or cash-equivalents for optionality  
• A full recession isn’t guaranteed, but tariffs raise the odds if combined with weak demand, inflation persistence, or liquidity tightening.  
• In past tariff-induced downturns (e.g., 2019), Fed rate cuts were key to supporting recoveries; similar policy easing could occur if 2025 headwinds worsen.

Questions the article leaves open  
• Will tariff pressures by mid-2025 be sufficient—on their own or with other shocks—to trigger an FOMC rate cut announcement before July 1?  
• How rapidly will global growth indicators and inflation data evolve ahead of key FOMC meetings?

<Summary source="https://cointelegraph.com/news/federal-reserve-rate-cuts-delay-may-trigger-bear-market-analyst">
Article: “Fed not cutting rates ’at all’ in 2025 may trigger a bear market — Analyst” (Cointelegraph, March 9, 2025)

1. Context and trigger
   - Network economist Timothy Peterson warns that if the U.S. Federal Reserve delays cutting rates throughout 2025, it could trigger a broader market downturn.
   - In a March 8 post on X, Peterson wrote: “What it needs is a trigger. I think that trigger may be as simple as the Fed not cutting rates at all this year.”
   - This follows Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s March 7 speech in New York: “We do not need to be in a hurry and are well‐positioned to wait for greater clarity,” indicating no imminent rate cuts.

2. Peterson’s Bitcoin downside model
   - Peterson is the author of the paper “Metcalfe’s Law as a Model for Bitcoin’s Value.”
   - He applies a “Nasdaq lowest price forward” model, which estimates that in a bear market the Nasdaq would fall about 17% over roughly seven months before bottoming.
   - Multiplying that 17% decline by 1.9 (his Bitcoin‐to‐Nasdaq multiplier) implies a 33% drop for Bitcoin—from $86,199 (CoinMarketCap at publication) down to about $57,000.

3. Likely floor closer to $70,000
   - Peterson argues Bitcoin probably won’t fall as low as $57,000 because opportunistic investors step in when prices appear “low enough.”
   - He cites 2022: analysts expected a bottom near $12,000 but Bitcoin only fell to ~$16,000 (25% higher than forecast). Applying a similar 25% offset to $57,000 yields about $71,000.
   - Historical note: Bitcoin last traded near $71,000 on Nov. 6, 2024 (following Donald Trump’s election win).

4. Comparable views from other crypto figures
   - Arthur Hayes (BitMEX co-founder), in a Jan. 27 X post, predicted a $70,000–$75,000 Bitcoin correction in early 2025, followed by renewed money printing driving BTC to $250,000 by year-end.
   - Blockware Solutions (crypto mining firm), in Dec. 2024, described a 2025 “bear case” for Bitcoin of $150,000—contingent on the Fed reversing course on rate cuts.

Summary of “Will the Fed pull the trigger on rate cut?” (Bond Buyer, October 21, 2024)

Facts and statistics  
• At its September 2024 meeting, the FOMC cut its target federal funds rate by 50 basis points.  
• The Fed released a new Summary of Economic Projections (the “dot plot”) forecasting year-end rates for 2024. Roughly half of FOMC participants signaled they would cut a total of 75 bps in 2024 (implying 25 bps each in November and December).  
• Weekly U.S. initial jobless claims most recently came in below market expectations, indicating continued labor-market strength.  
• U.S. equity markets reacted with heightened volatility on the day of the rate cut announcement—rising several hundred points, then falling about 700 points, then reversing again.  

Opinions from named, reliable sources  
Marvin Loh, Senior Macro Strategist at State Street Global Markets  
• “Victory is at hand” – the Fed appears confident it has achieved a soft landing: inflation is near target, growth is back on track, unemployment remains low.  
• Despite the unified outward message, beneath the surface there remains “a lot of uncertainty” among individual Fed members about risks to inflation, growth and employment.  
• Most economists and strategists had expected a 25 bp cut; Powell pushed for 50 bp, “trying to make everybody happy, but made nobody happy” (except equity markets).  
• The Fed’s core purpose in beginning rate cuts is to move back toward a neutral policy rate now that inflation and labor markets have improved; markets now seek clarity on the Fed’s “response function”—i.e., what data thresholds will drive further cuts or a halt.

<Summary source="https://www.thestreet.com/economy/fed-rate-cut-bets-hammered-by-u-s-china-tariff-truce">
Here is a concise summary of the May 12, 2025 TheStreet article by Martin Baccardax:

1. Current policy and pause rationale  
   – The Fed’s target federal funds rate remains at 4.375%.  
   – Chair Jerome Powell (last week) said the Fed needs “further clarity on tariffs” before cutting rates, citing risks that sustained levies could boost inflation, slow growth and raise unemployment.

2. U.S.–China tariff truce  
   – Agreement cuts U.S. tariffs on China-made goods to ~30% and Chinese levies on U.S. exports to 10%.  
   – Both sides will hold these rates for at least 90 days and set up a mechanism for ongoing economic and trade discussions.  
   – The deal restores roughly $600 billion of two-way trade and, per the article, “likely eliminates the risk of a U.S. recession” through year-end.

3. Growth and inflation data  
   – Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tool estimates Q2 real GDP growth at +2.3%; Commerce Dept’s advance Q1 reading was –0.3%.  
   – April CPI (due Tuesday) is forecast at +2.4% year-on-year (headline) and +0.3% month-on-month, with core inflation at 2.8% YOY and +0.3% MO M (economists’ consensus).

4. Market-implied rate-cut odds  
   – CME FedWatch: probability of a June rate cut has plunged to 8.1% (from 64.4% a month ago); traders now price the first cut no earlier than September.  
   – Market-wide expectations for 2025 have been pared from three cuts to two, implying a year-end funds rate of 3.75–4%.

5. Yield and FX moves  
   – U.S. dollar index up 1.22% on Monday.  
   – 10-year Treasury yield +8 bps to 4.463%; 2-year yield +12 bps to 4.002%.

6. Expert commentary  
   – John Hardy, global head of macro strategy at Saxo Bank: “We may have to wait for the May economic data cycle at minimum and possibly also the June data to get a better read on the U.S. economic trajectory.”  
   – Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING: “U.S. CPI numbers are expected to come in quite hot on Tuesday, keeping U.S. rates supported… positive headlines can remain the main driver of global rates. Until told otherwise by data or headlines, the upward pressure on rates can hold for now.”

<Summary source="https://money.com/no-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025-possible/">
Here’s a concise summary of the Money article (Jan. 16, 2025) by Pete Grieve:

• Bank of America revision  
  – Now expects no Fed rate cuts in 2025, holding the federal funds rate at 4.25%–4.5% for an extended period.  
  – Had previously forecast two 25-basis-point cuts.  
  – Revision driven by stronger labor-market data and stickier inflation.

• Recent economic data  
  – December jobs report: +250,000 jobs; unemployment down to 4.1%.  
  – December CPI: annual inflation rose from 2.7% to 2.9% (“modestly above target,” per BofA).

• Tariff risks  
  – President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexico and China could push prices higher if enacted.

• Fed officials’ views  
  – John Williams (New York Fed president, FOMC voter): economy is healthy; labor-market and inflation mandates are “in balance,” but disinflation “will take time” and may be “choppy.”  
  – Chris Brigati (SWBC CIO): “We may very well see no rate cuts this year.”

• Recent Fed rate-cut timeline  
  – March 2022–July 2023: 11 rate hikes to 5.25%–5.5%.  
  – Sept 2024: −50 bps; Nov 2024: −25 bps; Dec 2024: −25 bps.  
  – Current range (4.25%–4.5%) remains about 1 percentage point below the peak.

• Forward guidance and market odds  
  – December’s Fed “dot plot” showed officials penciling in two cuts for 2025 (down from four cuts expected in September).  
  – As of mid-January, CME FedWatch sees a high probability of one cut by June 2025, with odds of a second cut closer to 50%.

<Summary source="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/06/the-fed-meets-with-uncertainty-permeating-the-air-heres-what-to-expect.html">
Here’s a concise summary of the CNBC article by Jeff Cox (May 6, 2025):

• Context & Fed stance  
  – At its May meeting, the Fed is strongly inclined to “do nothing,” given cross-currents in the economy and uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs.  
  – No new economic projections or the “dot plot” will be released until June, leaving only tweaks to the statement and Powell’s press conference to signal future policy.

• Economic data & market expectations  
  – Q1 GDP fell 0.3% annualized, driven largely by a surge in imports ahead of April 2 tariff hikes.  
  – April nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000, ahead of expectations.  
  – Manufacturing and services surveys show heightened concerns about inflation and supply-chain impacts.  
  – Consumer optimism is at multi-year lows; inflation expectations at multi-decade highs.  
  – CME FedWatch: almost zero chance of a rate cut at the May meeting; ~1-in-3 odds of a cut in June.

• Views from economists  
  – Vincent Reinhart (BNY Investments): The Fed “has to wait” to see policy effects and gauge inflation expectations before cutting—expects two cuts in 2025 (tighter than market’s three starting in July).  
  – David Mericle (Goldman Sachs): It will take “a couple of months” of hard data to justify cuts; Goldman forecasts cuts in July, September and October to counter looming weakness.  
  – Nuveen: Also projects two cuts this year and two more in 2026.

• Political wild card  
  – President Trump is publicly urging rate cuts as inflation approaches the Fed’s 2% target.  
  – Reinhart believes the Fed will resist White House pressure and maintain internal unity.

<Summary source="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/fed-rate-decision-march-2025.html">
Here’s a concise summary of Jeff Cox’s CNBC article (March 19, 2025):

Fed Decision and Forward Guidance  
• The FOMC left the federal-funds rate unchanged at 4.25%–4.50% (where it’s been since December).  
• Officials reiterated they still expect a total of 50 bp of rate cuts in 2025—i.e. two quarter-point reductions—though timing wasn’t specified.  
• In the “dot plot,” four participants (vs. one in December) now see no rate changes in 2025, with two cuts penciled in for 2026, one more in 2027, and a longer-run rate around 3%.

Chair Powell’s Remarks  
• Powell stressed rates could stay higher “if the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2%.”  
• Conversely, he said the Fed stands ready to ease policy if the labor market weakens unexpectedly or inflation falls faster than anticipated.

Economic Projections & Outlook  
• Growth forecast for 2025 was cut to 1.7% (down 0.4 pp from December).  
• Core-PCE inflation projection was raised to 2.8% (up 0.3 pp).  
• The post-meeting statement noted “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased” and emphasized attentiveness to risks on both sides of its dual mandate.

Quantitative Tightening (QT)  
• The Fed cut its monthly Treasury runoff cap from $25 billion to $5 billion.  
• The $35 billion cap on mortgage-backed securities remains unchanged.  

Dissent and Market Reaction  
• Governor Christopher Waller dissented—he favored holding rates steady but wanted QT to proceed at its prior pace.  
• Investors cheered the prospect of cuts: the Dow rose over 400 points on the announcement.

Broader Context and Commentary  
• Tariffs on steel, aluminum and other goods, plus looming threats of more duties, are clouding the outlook and may pressure prices higher.  
• Powell pointed to a “moderation in consumer spending” and noted tariffs could add to inflation.  
• Retail spending in February rose less than expected, though underlying indicators remain solid.  
• Nonfarm payroll gains slowed in February, and a broader unemployment measure climbed 0.5 pp to its highest since October 2021.  
• Brian Moynihan (BofA CEO) said card-spending data show consumers holding up well; BofA expects ~2% growth this year.  
• Jamie Cox (Harris Financial) argued the Fed effectively “indirectly cut rates” by slowing QT, paving the way for rate cuts by summer.  
• David Russell (TradeStation) described the Fed’s stance as “stagflationary,” reflecting weaker GDP forecasts alongside higher inflation estimates.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the Reuters article as provided.

– Context: Ahead of the Fed’s March 18-19 meeting, markets are shifting their expectation for the first rate cut of 2025 from May to June.  
– Labor market data (February):  
  • Nonfarm payrolls rose by 151,000 jobs, above the 80,000–100,000 “healthy” monthly pace cited by Fed Governor Christopher Waller.  
  • Unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%.  
  • U-6 underemployment rate climbed to 8.0%—its highest since October 2021.  
  • The federal government shed jobs, though fuller effects of tech-sector and “Department of Government Efficiency” cuts (including Elon Musk’s workforce reductions) may appear in March or April data.  
– Fed views:  
  • Governor Waller and other officials say a still-strong labor market supports keeping the federal funds target at 4.25%–4.50% until more inflation progress is seen.  
  • Several policymakers want clarity on the Trump administration’s on-again, off-again tariff policies before moving on rates.  
– Analyst commentary (Julia Coronado, Macro Policy Perspectives):  
  • February’s data show early softening even before federal hiring cuts fully materialize.  
  • Reduced immigration, federal job losses, “the chilling effect of uncertainty from DOGE payment defaults and tariff policy” are expected to slow hiring further, creating risks for both sides of the Fed’s dual mandate.  
– Market reaction:  
  • Traders in short-term rate futures now price a first cut in June (up from May), but still see three total cuts in 2025.  
  • In December, Fed officials had anticipated two cuts this year; the March meeting will update their “dot-plot” projections.  
– Next steps: Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later on Friday, offering the Fed’s latest outlook on the economy and monetary policy.

Article: “Fed officials offer differing signals on timing of potential interest rate cuts”  
Source: Scotsman Guide, April 25, 2025 (Luke Baynes)

Key facts and named‐source views:

• Current federal funds rate range: 4.25%–4.50%.  
• Beth Hammack (President & CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; alternate FOMC member) on CNBC:  
  – Doubtful of any rate move at the May 7 FOMC meeting.  
  – June cut possible if “clear and convincing data” emerge by then.  
  – Quote: “You’ve seen that this is not a Fed that is afraid of moving quickly if we need to move quickly…if we know which way is the right way to move at that point in time.”  

• Christopher Waller (Federal Reserve Governor; voting FOMC member) on Bloomberg TV:  
  – Would support rate cuts if Trump administration tariffs cause a marked rise in unemployment.  
  – Doesn’t expect tariffs’ impact to be “enough…in the next couple of months until you get past July,” at which point cuts may be needed.  
  – Quote: “I would expect more rate cuts and sooner once I start seeing some serious deterioration in the labor market.”  

• Jerome Powell (Fed Chair) has remained publicly neutral on timing; no new comments since his April 16 Chicago speech.  

• President Donald Trump’s recent comments (via Truth Social and reporters):  
  – April 17 post: “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!”  
  – April 22 (approx.) clarification: “No intention to fire” Powell.  
  – Subsequently: “I might call [Powell]…I believe he’s making a mistake by not lowering interest rates.”  

• Market expectations (CME Fed Watch Tool, as of Friday afternoon):  
  – 64% probability of a rate cut at the June 18 FOMC meeting.  
  – Futures-implied odds of three to four total cuts by year-end, beginning in June.  

No unverified or anonymous opinions were cited.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Three potential reference classes:

1. **Historical Fed Tightening Cycles (Post-2000)**: 
   - 1999-2000: 7.5 months between last hike and first cut
   - 2004-2006: 14.5 months between last hike and first cut
   - 2015-2018: 7.5 months between last hike and first cut

2. **Fed Behavior During Inflation Above Target**:
   - Current core PCE at 2.6% vs. 2% target
   - Historically, Fed prioritizes price stability when above target

3. **Current Market Expectations**:
   - Multiple sources indicate July 2025 as expected timing for first cut

The most suitable reference class combines market expectations with current economic indicators, as historical tightening cycles don't fully capture the unique current situation (a prior cut in September 2024 followed by a pause, plus tariff-induced inflation pressures).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The question asks about a cut before July 1, 2025, which is:
- ~1.5 months from today (May 14, 2025)
- ~5 months after January 2025 Fed pause
- ~9 months after September 2024 rate cut of 50bp

Based on the FOMC's typical meeting schedule, there are likely only two remaining meetings before July 1, 2025:
- May 2025 meeting (appears to have occurred May 7, according to USA Today)
- June 2025 meeting (likely mid-month)

## (d) Justification:

The evidence strongly suggests the Fed is unlikely to cut rates before July 1, 2025:

1. **Economic conditions don't necessitate an urgent cut**:
   - Inflation (2.6% core PCE) remains above the 2% target
   - Unemployment (4.2%) remains relatively low
   - While Q1 GDP contracted 0.3%, domestic demand indicators remain solid

2. **Fed communications indicate patience**:
   - Powell has stated they're in "no hurry" and want "further clarity" on tariff impacts
   - Fed has dropped language about inflation "making progress"
   - Powell indicated cuts would require either sharp labor market weakening or faster-than-expected inflation improvement

3. **Expert forecasts overwhelmingly point to July or later**:
   - J.P. Morgan: Hold through June, cuts starting in July
   - Barclays: First cut in July (moved from June forecast)
   - Morgan Stanley: No cuts until 2026 unless recession hits
   - Fed futures markets: First cut in July
   - CME FedWatch Tool: 86% probability of no May cut

4. **Tariff effects create uncertainty**:
   - The 10% baseline tariffs implemented under Trump, with higher rates on some goods
   - Barclays projects core inflation peaking at 3.8% in 2025 due to tariffs
   - Fed likely wants to assess full tariff impact before easing

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I'll consider:

1. The May meeting has likely already concluded without a cut (as implied by USA Today's article dated May 6 discussing the "May 7" meeting).

2. For a cut to occur before July 1, it would have to happen at the June meeting, which gives us essentially a binary outcome related to one specific FOMC meeting.

3. Market-based probabilities and expert forecasts overwhelmingly favor July over June for the first cut:
   - CME FedWatch showed 86% probability of no May cut
   - Multiple major financial institutions (J.P. Morgan, Barclays) explicitly forecast July for the first cut
   - Morgan Stanley doesn't expect cuts until 2026 barring recession

4. Economic data shows inflation persistently above target with tariff-driven pressures likely to persist.

Given these factors, and particularly the expert consensus around July timing, I estimate a 15-25% probability of a rate cut before July 1. The consensus clearly favors July or later, but I must account for the possibility of unexpected economic deterioration or inflation improvement that could prompt earlier action.

## Outside View Prediction:
17%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **CNN (January 29, 2025)**
   - Reports on the Fed's January pause with rates at 4.25-4.50%
   - Credible mainstream news source focusing on factual reporting of the Fed's decision
   - Notable facts: Fed dropped language saying inflation had "made progress"; Powell emphasized Fed independence from political pressure
   - Key opinions (from Powell): A sharp labor market weakening or faster-than-expected inflation slowdown would put cuts back on the table

   - Very recent reporting on anticipated Fed stance for May 7 meeting
   - Mainstream news source with specific economic data points and expert projections
   - Notable facts: Q1 GDP contracted 0.3%; inflation at 2.3% (core 2.6%); unemployment at 4.2%; tariffs expected to push prices higher
   - Key expert opinions: Barclays moved first cut from June to July; Morgan Stanley forecasts no cuts until 2026; Goldman Sachs suggests cuts could start in July with three reductions if business uncertainty spurs weakness

   - Notable facts: Fed held rates at 4.25-4.50%; PCE price index rose 0.3% month-over-month
   - Key expert opinion: J.P. Morgan forecasts the Fed will hold through June 2025, then deliver two rate cuts by year-end

4. **CCN.com (April 17, 2025)**

   - Notable facts: Fed's target rate at 4.25-4.50%; CME FedWatch Tool shows 86% expected no rate cut at May meeting; Fed's dot plot forecasts two cuts by year-end
   - Limited direct expert opinions on monetary policy

5. **Cointelegraph (March 9, 2025)**
   - Crypto news outlet reporting concerns about delayed rate cuts
   - Notable facts: References Powell's March 7 speech indicating "no hurry" for rate cuts
   - Opinions mostly from crypto-focused analysts rather than monetary policy experts

6. **Bond Buyer (October 21, 2024)**
   - Specialized financial publication reporting on September 2024 rate cuts
   - Valuable historical context but less relevant to current conditions
   - Notable expert: Marvin Loh (State Street) described uncertainty among Fed members

7. **Perplexity Report on Fed Tightening Cycles**
   - Factual compilation of historical Fed policy cycles
   - High-quality source with specific intervals between hike cycles and first cuts
   - Purely fact-based with minimal opinion content

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Most appropriate reference classes:

1. **Historical Fed Cutting Cycles (post-2000)**: Most directly relevant to our question. The Perplexity report shows that since 2000, the Fed has typically waited 7-14 months between its last hike and first cut (7 months in 2000-2001 and 2018-2019, 14 months in 2006-2007).

2. **Fed Response to Inflationary Supply Shocks**: The tariff situation creates supply-side inflation pressure while growth shows mixed signals. This resembles aspects of 2018-2019 (trade tensions) but with different underlying conditions.

3. **Fed Decision-Making in New Presidential Administrations**: Trump's inauguration in January 2025 and stated preference for lower rates adds political context.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: The historical Fed cutting cycles appears most appropriate. The current situation shows the Fed paused its previous cutting cycle in January 2025 with rates at 4.25-4.50%. If we use this as our starting point and apply the historical 7-month minimum waiting period, we'd expect the earliest cut around August 2025.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

From today (May 14, 2025) to the resolution date (July 1, 2025) is approximately 48 days.

The typical FOMC meeting schedule would suggest one remaining meeting in mid-June before the resolution date. This provides only one opportunity for a rate cut announcement within our timeframe.

Looking at historical patterns:
- The shortest observed interval between end of hiking and first cut is 7 months
- If we start from January 2025 (when the Fed paused cuts), a 7-month interval would suggest no cuts until August 2025
- This timeline places the likely first cut after our resolution date

## (d) Justification

Several factors suggest a cut before July 1, 2025 is unlikely:

1. **Historical precedent**: The 7-month minimum waiting period observed in past cycles would put the earliest cut in August 2025.

2. **Market consensus**: Multiple credible sources (USA TODAY, J.P. Morgan) indicate market expectations and institutional forecasts point to July 2025 or later for the first cut:
   - Fed futures markets expect first cut in July
   - Barclays moved their forecast from June to July
   - J.P. Morgan forecasts holding through June
   - Morgan Stanley expects no cuts until 2026 unless recession hits

3. **Economic conditions**: The data doesn't yet justify urgent easing:
   - Inflation (2.3% headline, 2.6% core) remains above the 2% target
   - Labor market remains relatively strong (4.2% unemployment)
   - Q1 GDP contraction appears driven by one-time import surges rather than fundamental weakness
   - Tariffs are expected to create additional inflationary pressure

4. **Fed communications**: Powell has explicitly stated they're "in no hurry" to cut rates (March 7) and wants "further clarity" on tariff impacts (May 6).

5. **Policy priorities**: The Fed appears to be prioritizing price stability over growth concerns at this juncture, as inflation remains further from target than employment.

However, some factors provide a non-zero probability:

1. The June FOMC meeting does provide one opportunity for a cut before the resolution date.
2. Goldman Sachs noted cuts could come if business uncertainty spurs significant weakness.
3. A sharp deterioration in economic data between now and June could change the Fed's calculus.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I'll consider:

1. Historical timing: Past cycles show a minimum 7-month wait, which would place cuts beyond our timeframe.

2. Market expectations: The CME FedWatch Tool showed 86% expected no cut at the May meeting. Multiple institutional forecasters (J.P. Morgan, Barclays, Morgan Stanley) all project initial cuts in July or later.

3. Economic context: Inflation remains above target with tariff pressures likely to push it higher; labor market remains relatively strong.

4. Expert consensus: The predominant view across reliable sources is that cuts won't begin until July at the earliest, with several projecting later timelines.

Given the strong consensus among major financial institutions that cuts won't come until July or later, combined with the Fed's own communications about being "in no hurry," I assess a low probability of cuts before July 1. However, I must acknowledge the possibility of rapid economic deterioration that could prompt an earlier move.

## Outside View Prediction:
12% probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   A. CNN (January 29, 2025)  
   - Summary: Fed paused rate cuts at 4.25–4.50%; dropped “progress on inflation” language; sees need for labor‐market weakening or sharper inflation slowdown to justify cuts; studying tariff impacts; Powell reaffirms data‐driven, independent Fed.  
   - Quality: High. Authoritative reporting on FOMC decision, directly quoting Chair Powell and summarizing Fed communications. Opinions are clearly marked (e.g., market reactions, Trump’s comments).  
   - Useable facts: pause decision, 4.25–4.50% rate, conditions for cuts, evolving language, labor‐market and inflation data.  

   B. USA TODAY (May 6, 2025)  
   - Summary: Ahead of May meeting, Fed in “no hurry” to cut; wants clarity on tariffs’ impact; Q1 GDP weak (–0.3%) but domestic demand solid; inflation above target (2.3% core PCE); labor market still strong; consensus that Fed will hold in May unless data surprise; forecasters split on timing (July or later).  
   - Quality: Medium‐high. Relies on data from government releases and client memos from major banks. Opinions are mostly from published research notes. Factual data on GDP, jobs, inflation are reliable.  
   - Useable facts: solid underlying demand, sticky inflation, consensus that Fed will wait for labor‐market softening.  

   C. J.P. Morgan (March 3, 2025 research note)  
   - Summary: Fed held in Jan; PCE data in line; consumer inflation expectations rising; Fed likely holds through June 2025, then two cuts; cuts dependent on continued inflation moderation or labor‐market softening.  
   - Quality: High. JPM is a large, reputable institution with in‐house economists. Opinion (Feroli’s view) is expert insight but should be given moderate weight.  
   - Useable facts: Fed hold‐through‐June baseline, dot‐plot implying cuts, risks and data thresholds.  

   D. CCN.com (April 17, 2025)  
   - Summary: Large tariffs (up to 145%) risk a recession; tariffs act as downturn accelerant; Fed cuts are historical recession response; markets expect no cut in May (86%); Fed dot plot signals two cuts by end-2025.  
   - Quality: Medium. CCN is niche financial news; data on tariff rates and CME FedWatch odds are factual. Opinion about recession risk is less formal.  
   - Useable facts: CME FedWatch probabilities, Fed dot‐plot two cuts by year-end.  

   E. Cointelegraph (March 9, 2025)  
   - Summary: Analyst warns no 2025 cuts could trigger bear market; models for Bitcoin decline; cuts seen as market stabilizer.  
   - Quality: Low-medium. Crypto‐focused, opinions from “network economist” and BitMEX co-founder. Factual Fed quotes are solid; market‐impact models are speculative.  
   - Useable facts: Powell’s “no hurry” quote; anecdotal risk that no cuts spook markets.  

   F. Bond Buyer (October 2024)  
   - Summary: October 2024 rate cut of 50 bps; Fed dot plot showed more cuts; State Street strategist says Fed confident in soft landing but sees uncertainty; markets want clarity on future “response function.”  
   - Quality: Medium. Live forum transcript of reputable strategist; applies to a prior cycle but shows how Fed frames rate‐cut rollouts.  
   - Useable facts: Fed tends to communicate data thresholds post‐cut, uncertainty among members.  

   G. Perplexity report (tightening cycles since 2000)  
   - Summary: Four tightening cycles: 2000, 2004–07, 2015–19, 2022–ongoing; intervals from last hike to first cut ranged 7–15 months; cuts signaled by weakening growth, rising unemployment, tighter credit conditions, muted inflation.  
   - Quality: Medium. Sourced from official Fed releases and BLS/BEA data but condensed by an LLM; numbers look credible but require spot‐checking.  
   - Useable facts: typical lags between last hike and first cut (mean ~9½ months), signals that triggered cuts.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
   - Candidate classes:  
     a. All tightening cycles since 2000 (n=3 completed): first cut arrived 7, 15, and 7 months after last hike (avg ≈10 months).  
     b. Probability of a June FOMC cut given a prolonged pause: historically, the Fed has almost never made its first cut at a June meeting—Sept or July are typical.  
     c. Market‐implied probabilities (CME FedWatch) for a June cut: currently under 20%.  
   - Suitability: Class (b) and (c) most directly address the question’s deadline of July 1 (which implies only June as a viable cut month). Class (a) helps set overall cut‐timing expectations but is less precise given the long pause that has already exceeded the average.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   - Resolution window: today (May 14) until July 1, 2025. Only the June 10–11 FOMC meeting—or an emergency off-cycle cut—would satisfy the question. That leaves <4 weeks to June meeting and <7 weeks to resolution date.  
   - Historical analog: Fed nearly always makes its first cut on a regular quarterly meeting (Jan, Mar, Jul, or Sep). Off-cycle cuts are rare and tied to emergencies (2001, 2008). No clear trigger today merits emergency action.  

4. Justification for outside view  
   - We are well past the historical average lag (10 months) and still have not seen the first cut; that argues for some upward drift in cut probability relative to a fresh pause—but only for later meetings (July or September), which lie outside our deadline.  
   - No new emergency shock (e.g., systemic financial crisis or sharp labor‐market downturn) is apparent; Q1 GDP weakness was import-driven ahead of tariffs, domestic activity remains solid, and labor data are still “brisk.”  
   - Inflation is above target (2.3% core PCE) and expected to be pushed higher by tariffs; Fed has emphasized price stability and “no hurry.”  
   - Expert surveys (Barclays, Goldman, Deutsche) point to July or later for the first cut; few foresee a June move.  
   - Market‐implied odds of a June cut are under 20%.  

Outside view calibration:  
‐ Start with the market’s June cut odds (~<20%).  
‐ Adjust slightly upward to reflect the fact that we are well past the average historical lag and that officials have signaled cuts will happen in 2025—even if not in June, there’s a small chance of an out-of-cycle or expedited timeline.  
‐ Cap at a probability below one in four given the Fed’s clear communications and lack of triggering data.

Outside View Prediction:  
17% chance that the FOMC will announce a reduction in the target federal funds rate before July 1, 2025.

    – 2015–18: last hike Dec 2018, first cut Jul 2019 (7 months)  
  • Quality: Medium. Historical Fed dates are correct, but secondary source.  

Reference-class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
  1. U.S. tightening cycles since 2000. Cuts occurred 7–15 months after last hike. Our current cycle’s last hike was July 2023—22 months ago—making us already beyond the upper historical bound.  
  2. Recent pauses without inflation at or above target. In 2019 inflation was below target and cut came in 7 months. Today inflation is above target, which historically delays cuts even longer.  
  3. Fed dot-plot forecasts vs. realized action. In past cycles, Fed has tended to lag its own dot-plot by one meeting.  

The best reference class is “tightening cycles since 2000,” adjusted for current higher-than-target inflation that tends to delay cuts.  

Timeframe analysis  
  • Today is May 14, 2025; resolution is July 1, 2025—47 days away.  
  • Only the June 17–18 FOMC meeting falls before resolution.  
  • Historically, once the Fed signals a pause—especially with inflation above target—cutting in the very next meeting occurs less than a quarter of the time.  

Justification  
  • Historical norms: Past cycles saw cuts 7–15 months after the last hike. We are 22 months in without a cut. That suggests cuts are overdue by the outside view.  
  • Inflations’ stickiness and labor resilience: Powell has dropped “progress” language, core inflation remains above target (2.3–2.6%), unemployment steady around 4.1–4.2%. These conditions argue for a longer pause.  
  • Fed communications: Unanimous “no hurry,” waiting for clearer tariff and labor data; dot plot still shows cuts only starting in July or later.  
  • Market pricing: CME FedWatch puts near-zero odds on a June cut, high odds for July.  
  • Only one meeting remains before the July 1 cutoff, and Fed officials have shown no urgency.  

Putting it all together, the outside-view probability is that the Fed will NOT cut by July 1, and thus the chance of a rate cut announcement before that date is relatively low.

Outside view calibration  
  • Historical reference-class median cut lag ~9 months; we’re well past that.  
  • Market-implied probabilities for a June cut are below 20%.  
  • Expert consensus (Goldman, Barclays, JP Morgan) points to July or later.  

Given these points, a reasonable outside-view probability of a cut before July 1, 2025 is about 20%.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 20% chance the Fed announces a rate cut before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• CNN, 29 Jan 2025 (Bryan Mena).  Factual: policy rate is 4.25-4.50 %; Fed removed language about inflation “progress”; unemployment 4.1 %.  Opinions: Powell’s quotes on conditions for cuts; investors’ mixed expectations.  Quality: large news outlet, direct Fed‐chair quotes = high reliability.  
• USA TODAY, 6 May 2025 (Paul Davidson).  Factual: Q1-25 GDP −0.3 % (annualised); core PCE 2.6 %; jobs +177 k April; CME futures see first cut in July.  Opinions from Barclays, Deutsche, Goldman on timing.  Quality: mainstream paper citing data and bulge-bracket research → good.  
• J.P. Morgan Research note, 3 Mar 2025.  Factual: January CPI/PCE prints; JP Morgan forecast two cuts starting July.  Opinion: Feroli’s rationale.  Quality: identifiable expert, reputable.  
• CCN, 17 Apr 2025.  Mostly commentary on tariff risk and market moves.  Hard data: current policy rate, futures pricing (86 % no-cut in May).  Opinion: author speculation.  Quality: niche finance site; stick to quoted data.  
• Cointelegraph, 9 Mar 2025.  Crypto-centric; only relevant fact: Powell 7 Mar speech reiterating “no hurry.”  Quality: low for macro but Powell quote credible.  
• Bond Buyer, 21 Oct 2024.  Background on earlier cuts; emphasises uncertainty within FOMC.  Quality: specialist fixed-income journal, useful historical colour.  
• Perplexity report (historical tightening cycles).  Derived from Fed/BLS/BEA.  Gives base-rate statistics: 3 prior cycles → first cut came 7–14 months after last hike.  Quality: secondary compilation but references primary Fed releases and agencies → acceptable for base-rate use.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes  
1. “Any random FOMC meeting” since 1994 → P(cut) ≈ cuts ÷ meetings ≈ 45/240 ≈ 19 %.  Too broad: ignores where we are in cycle.  
2. “Meetings ≤6 months after a pause in an unfinished easing cycle” (e.g., 1995, 2003, 2010, 2019).  Empirical: roughly 3 cuts in 15 such meetings → ≈20 %.  
3. “Meetings when core inflation >2 % and unemployment 4–5 %” (still restrictive stance).  Very few cuts (2007 Q4 the exception) → probability well below 10 %.  

Given the current macro resembles class 3, but we want a neutral outside view, class 2 (post-pause within a still-restrictive cycle) is most suitable.  It gives a clean numeric base rate (~20 % at the next meeting) and uses readily observable cycle position.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until deadline: 48.  Only one scheduled FOMC meeting remains (17-18 Jun 2025).  Historically, unscheduled emergency cuts inside a 7-week window are rare: 3 inter-meeting cuts since 1994 (Jan 2001, Sep 2001, Mar 2020) ⇒ base-rate ≈3/370 months ≈1 %.  Therefore the overwhelming pathway (>95 %) is a cut, or none, at the 18 June meeting.

(d) Justification of outside-view probability  
• Frequency of a cut at “first meeting after a multi-meeting pause in a still-restrictive easing cycle” ≈20 %.  
• Probability of an inter-meeting cut in any 7-week stretch ≈1 %.  
• Combine: P(cut before 1 Jul 2025) ≈ 0.20 + (0.01 × (1-0.20)) ≈ 0.21 (21 %).  
• Market-implied odds are lower for June than for July (first-cut contract priced for July), which loosely corroborates a figure in the low-20s, but we do not yet fold that into the inside view.  
• No attempt is made to interpret current CPI or labour data—that is reserved for the inside-view step.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 19–20 % per-meeting base rate for a cut in the post-pause phase; add 1 % for a very low but non-zero chance of an emergency move.  Round to the nearest full percentage point to avoid spurious precision but keep 1 % granularity.

Outside View Prediction:
21 % chance the Federal Reserve will announce at least one interest-rate cut before 1 July 2025.

**Reuters (March 7, 2025)**
- Facts: Markets shifted expectations from May to June cut; February payrolls +151K; unemployment 4.1%.
- Expert opinions: Governor Waller cited strong labor market for maintaining rates.
- Quality: Two months old; reputable global news agency with Fed official quotes.

**Scotsman Guide (April 25, 2025)**
- Facts: Fed funds rate at 4.25-4.5%; Trump criticized Powell but won't fire him.
- Expert opinions: Beth Hammack (Cleveland Fed) doubts May cut, says June possible with "clear data"; Christopher Waller wouldn't expect impacts "until past July."
- Quality: Recent (3 weeks old); contains direct quotes from current FOMC members.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple FOMC members' recent statements (Waller, Hammack) specifically mentioning timeframes beyond June for likely cuts
- March 2025 dot plot showing only two total cuts for 2025, with four members projecting no cuts
- Inflation persistently above target (core PCE 2.8%, expected April core CPI 2.8%)
- CME FedWatch showing June cut probability plummeting from 64.4% to 8.1% over past month

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Economic resilience despite Q1 contraction (Q2 GDPNow +2.3%, April payrolls +177K)
- US-China tariff truce reducing economic uncertainty that Powell had cited
- Multiple financial institutions (Goldman, BNY, others) specifically forecasting July as earliest cut

**Weak Evidence:**
- Trump's public pressure for rate cuts
- Consumer sentiment at multi-year lows

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The question concerns a cut before July 1, 2025, which is approximately 6-7 weeks from today (May 14, 2025). Based on typical FOMC schedules, there is likely only one remaining meeting before the deadline:
- June 2025 meeting (typically mid-June, around June 18)

If the timeframe were halved (by June 1), probability would approach zero since no FOMC meeting would occur. If doubled (by September 1), probability would increase to 60-70% as it would include the July and potentially August meetings, when most experts expect cuts to begin.

## (d) Justification:

The evidence strongly suggests the Fed is unlikely to cut rates before July 1, 2025:

1. **Direct Fed Communication**: Multiple officials have explicitly mentioned timeframes beyond June. Waller specifically said he doesn't expect significant impacts "until past July." Hammack was "doubtful" about May and conditional about June.

2. **Economic Conditions Don't Warrant Urgent Action**:
   - Inflation remains above target (2.8% core PCE)
   - Labor market remains relatively healthy (April +177K jobs)
   - While Q1 GDP contracted (-0.3%), Q2 is projected to rebound (+2.3%)

3. **Market Expectations Have Shifted Later**: CME FedWatch shows only 8.1% probability of a June cut, down from 64.4% a month ago. Multiple institutional forecasts (Goldman Sachs, BNY, others) specifically point to July or later.

4. **US-China Tariff Resolution**: The recent tariff truce actually reduces uncertainty that Powell had cited as a reason for caution, potentially decreasing the urgency for protective rate cuts.

5. **FOMC's March Projections**: The dot plot showed only two cuts for all of 2025, with four members projecting no cuts, suggesting no urgency to begin cutting in the first half of the year.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view prediction was 17%, which aligns with historical patterns and general economic conditions. Given the strong recent evidence pointing specifically to July rather than June for the first cut, I find this outside view quite accurate.

For a cut to occur before July 1, it would essentially require a decision at the June FOMC meeting (around June 18). The probability of this has fallen dramatically according to market pricing (now at 8.1%). Multiple Fed officials have explicitly indicated caution about cutting before seeing more data.

There are scenarios that could prompt an earlier cut (sharp economic deterioration, market disruption, or surprisingly benign inflation), but these appear unlikely based on recent information. The tariff resolution with China actually reduces uncertainty rather than increasing it.

Given all this evidence, particularly the explicit comments from Fed officials about timeframes beyond June and the sharp decline in market-based probabilities, I calibrate my final probability to 12%.

## Checklist:
1. Question: Will the Federal Reserve announce a reduction in the target federal funds rate before July 1, 2025? (~7 weeks from now)
2. Outside view base rate was 17%, which aligns with current evidence
3. In 12 out of 100 similar situations, the Fed would announce a rate cut in the next 7 weeks
4. Key evidence: FOMC members explicitly mentioning post-June timing; inflation still above target; market probabilities for June cut fell from 64% to 8%
5. Blind spot: Unexpected rapid deterioration in employment data could prompt June cut
6. Status quo is no rate cut; Fed has shown preference for patience and data-dependence

Probability: 12%
Predicted Probability: 12.0%

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:
1. **TheStreet (May 12, 2025)** - High quality, very recent. Fed funds rate at 4.375%; Powell wants tariff clarity before cuts; U.S.-China tariff truce announced; CME FedWatch shows June cut probability at just 8.1% (down from 64.4% a month ago); market now expects first cut no earlier than September.

2. **Money (Jan 16, 2025)** - Medium quality, older article. Bank of America revised forecast to no cuts in 2025; Fed made three cuts in late 2024 to current 4.25-4.5% range; December dot plot showed two cuts for 2025.

3. **CNBC (May 6, 2025)** - High quality, recent. Fed inclined to "do nothing" at May meeting due to economic cross-currents; Q1 GDP fell 0.3% but driven by import surge; CME FedWatch showed ~1-in-3 odds of June cut; economists expect 2-3 cuts in 2025.

4. **CNBC (March 19, 2025)** - High quality, moderate recency. Fed maintained 4.25-4.5% rate; officials still expect two 25bp cuts in 2025; four participants (vs. one in December) now see no cuts in 2025; Powell emphasized rates could stay higher if economy remains strong.

5. **Reuters (March 7, 2025)** - Medium-high quality, somewhat dated. Markets shifting first cut expectation from May to June; labor market showing early softening signs; traders pricing first cut in June with three total in 2025.

6. **Scotsman Guide (April 25, 2025)** - High quality, recent quotes from FOMC members. Beth Hammack (Cleveland Fed) sees June cut possible with "clear and convincing data"; Christopher Waller doesn't expect tariff impacts "until past July"; market showed 64% probability of June cut at that time.

## Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
1. Current Fed funds rate is 4.25-4.5% (4.375% midpoint), unchanged since December 2024 (confirmed across multiple sources).
2. Market-implied probability for a June cut has plummeted from 64.4% to just 8.1% in the past month (TheStreet, May 12).
3. U.S.-China tariff truce announced (TheStreet, May 12), addressing one of Powell's stated conditions but reducing urgency for cuts.
4. Fed Governor Waller explicitly stated he doesn't expect significant tariff impacts "until past July" (Scotsman Guide, April 25).
5. In March, four FOMC members projected no cuts at all in 2025, up from just one in December (CNBC, March 19).

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. Q1 GDP contracted 0.3%, but primarily due to import surges ahead of tariff implementation, not underlying weakness (CNBC, May 6).
2. Inflation remains above target, with core PCE projected at 2.8% and April CPI forecast at 2.4% (CNBC, TheStreet).
3. Cleveland Fed President Hammack indicated a June cut possible with "clear and convincing data" (Scotsman Guide, April 25).
4. Labor market remains relatively strong with 177,000 jobs added in April (CNBC, May 6).

**Weak Evidence:**
1. President Trump pressuring the Fed for rate cuts (Scotsman Guide) - Fed historically maintains independence.
2. Bank of America's January projection of no cuts in 2025 (Money) - somewhat dated single-source forecast.

## Timeframe Analysis:
We have approximately 6-7 weeks until the July 1 resolution date. The only scheduled FOMC meeting in this timeframe is June 10-11, making this the sole opportunity for a rate cut before the deadline (barring an emergency action, which is extremely rare without a crisis).

If the timeframe were halved (3-4 weeks), my prediction would be virtually identical, as we'd still be evaluating the same June meeting. If doubled (12-14 weeks), my probability would increase substantially to ~40-50%, as it would include both the June and July/August FOMC meetings.

## Justification:
The market's dramatic reassessment of June cut probability (from 64.4% to 8.1% in just one month) reflects significant new information, primarily:

1. **Tariff clarity achieved but impact assessment pending:** The U.S.-China tariff truce provides the "clarity" Powell wanted, but Waller specifically stated he doesn't expect to see material impacts "until past July."

2. **Still-elevated inflation:** Core PCE at 2.8% and CPI forecast at 2.4% remain above the Fed's 2% target, giving the committee reason for continued caution.

3. **No economic emergency:** Despite Q1 GDP contraction, domestic demand remains solid, the labor market is healthy, and there are no financial stability concerns that would necessitate an immediate cut.

4. **Increased hawkishness among FOMC members:** The number of officials projecting no 2025 cuts quadrupled from December to March, indicating growing resistance to easing policy.

5. **Explicit market signal:** Traders now price the first cut "no earlier than September" (TheStreet, May 12), suggesting a comprehensive reassessment of the Fed's likely path.

## Probability calibration
Starting with the current market-implied probability of 8.1% for a June cut, I'll consider whether adjustments are warranted:

Factors potentially increasing probability:
- Cleveland Fed President Hammack's statement that June remains possible with the right data
- We still have May jobs and inflation reports before the June meeting
- The Fed has projected two cuts in 2025, and June is a quarterly meeting with press conference

Factors potentially decreasing probability:
- The tariff truce mitigates one concern but doesn't create urgency for cuts
- Inflation remains persistently above target
- FOMC voting members like Waller expect to wait until after July
- No signs of labor market deterioration that would trigger an earlier move

The recent market reassessment from 64.4% to 8.1% for a June cut represents a meaningful integration of new information, particularly the tariff truce and continued strong economic data. However, I'll adjust slightly upward to 13% to account for the possibility of surprisingly weak data in the next jobs or inflation report, which could create the "clear and convincing" case Hammack referenced.

## Checklist:
1. Resolution criteria: Will the Fed announce a reduction in the target federal funds rate before July 1, 2025? (Essentially: Will they cut at the June 10-11 meeting?)

2. Outside view base rate: 17% from initial analysis; current market pricing shows 8.1% for June.

3. Consistency check: 13 out of 100 times, the Fed announces a rate cut at the June meeting - aligns with evidence showing it's possible but unlikely.

4. Key evidence:
   - Market probability for June cut fell from 64.4% to 8.1% in one month
   - Waller expects no significant tariff impacts "until past July"
   - Inflation remains above target (core PCE 2.8%, CPI forecast 2.4%)
   - U.S.-China tariff truce provides clarity but reduces urgency
   - Four FOMC members now project no cuts in 2025 (up from one)

5. Blind-spot: A combination of surprisingly weak May jobs report AND sharp inflation drop could create "clear and convincing" case for June cut.

6. Status quo: Fed has maintained current rate since December; typically moves cautiously when inflation exceeds target.

Probability: 13%
Predicted Probability: 13.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase and resolution  
   Will the Fed cut its target federal funds rate at any FOMC meeting announcement between today (May 14, 2025) and July 1, 2025 (inclusive)? Yes if any reduction is announced, regardless of effective date.

2. Source analysis  
   a. TheStreet (May 12 2025):  
      – Facts: Fed paused at 4.375%, Powell wants “further clarity on tariffs.”  
      – Markets price June cut at 8.1%.  
      – Reliability: mainstream, factual; opinions from identifiable experts (Hardy, Turner).  
   b. Money (Jan 16 2025):  
      – BofA now expects no cuts in 2025 due to sticky inflation, strong labor market.  
      – Markets in mid-Jan priced one cut by June.  
      – Reliability: major bank research; dated but useful for evolving views.  
   c. CNBC (May 6 2025):  
      – Fed “strongly inclined to do nothing” at May 7; no projections until June.  
      – June cut odds ~33%.  
      – Reliability: mainstream, quotes from Reinhart and Mericle.  
   d. CNBC (Mar 19 2025):  
      – Fed held at 4.25–4.50%; dot plot shows two cuts in 2025 but four policymakers see no cuts this year.  
      – Reliability: factual meeting coverage; dissent noted.  
   e. Reuters (Mar 7 2025):  
      – Markets moved first cut to June; labor market mixed signals; policymakers want tariff clarity.  
      – Reliability: high-quality wire service.  
   f. Scotsman Guide (Apr 25 2025):  
      – Cleveland Fed’s Hammack: possible June cut if data clear; Waller expects cuts “once I start seeing serious deterioration…past July.”  
      – Markets price 64% chance June.  
      – Reliability: direct Fed voices; niche publication but quotes original sources.

3. Evidence analysis  
   Strong evidence (large shifts):  
    – Historical Fed cycles show a 7-month minimum lag from last hike/pause to first cut (2000, 2006, 2018). Our pause began Jan 2025 → earliest cut Aug 2025.  
    – Multiple Fed officials (Powell, Williams, Waller, Hammack) publicly emphasize “no hurry” and need for data/clarity.  

   Moderate evidence (medium shifts):  
    – Market-implied odds for a June cut range from 8%–64%; consensus leans to July or later.  
    – Institutional forecasts (JPMorgan, Goldman, BofA, Morgan Stanley) largely push cuts to July or beyond.  

   Weak evidence (small shifts):  
    – One-off GDP swing from import surge; potential that Q2 data disappoint and spur earlier cut.  
    – Political pressure from President Trump for rate relief.

4. Reference‐class/outside‐view base rate  
   Applying the historical “7-month lag” yields effectively 0% probability of a cut before July 1, 2025 (Jan→Aug = 7 months).  

5. Timeframe analysis  
   – Horizon: 48 days, one FOMC meeting (June 18).  
   – If horizon halved (~24 days), no meetings → probability falls toward 0%.  
   – If horizon doubled (~96 days), includes July meeting → probability roughly doubles (to ~24% in our view, all else equal), but still low given slow Fed pace.

6. Inside‐view adjustments  
   Downward shifts:  
    – Strong Fed communications to wait (− large).  
    – Historical precedent (+0% before August).  
   Upward shifts:  
    – Divergence in market odds (some see 64% June) (+ moderate).  
    – Risk of data shock (hard landing fears) (+ small).  
    – One opportunity (June 18 meeting) (+ small).  

7. Justification of probability  
   Given the institutional consensus, Fed rhetoric, and historical pattern, a cut before July 1 is very unlikely. However, non-zero chance arises from:  
    1) June meeting is scheduled.  
    2) Unexpected economic deterioration (e.g., payroll collapse, inflation plunge) between now and mid-June.  
    3) Shifts in Fed dot-plot guidance at the June meeting itself.  

Probability calibration  
Base‐rate from historical lag: ~0%  
+ Market‐implied June odds variance: +8% (lower bound of credible CME pricing)  
+ Expert dissent and data‐shock risk: +4%  
+ Political pressure and tariff clarity: +2%  
= 14% rounded down modestly to account for Fed inertia → 12%

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will the Fed announce a rate cut before July 1, 2025?” – matches resolution.  
2. Outside‐view base rate: 0% (7-month historical lag)  
3. Consistency: 12 out of 100 times, despite pause in Jan 2025 and only one meeting left, a cut is announced.  
4. Top evidence (3–5):  
   • 7-month historical lag (strong)  
   • Fed officials’ “no hurry” messaging (strong)  
   • One June meeting window (moderate)  
   • Market‐implied odds divergence (moderate)  
   • Data‐shock risk (weak)  
5. Blind spot: Rapid collapse of employment/inflation could force an emergency cut—would raise probability to ~50%.  
6. Status quo: Fed tends to move slowly; default is “no cut.”

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase and resolution criteria  
   “Will the FOMC announce any reduction in its target federal funds rate between now (May 14, 2025) and July 1, 2025?”  Only the June 17–18 meeting remains before cutoff.

2. Source analysis  
   – TheStreet (May 12): High quality. Reports Powell needs more tariff clarity before cutting; market odds of June cut collapsed to ~8%.  
   – Money (Jan 16): High quality. BofA now expects no cuts in 2025 due to sticky inflation and strong jobs.  
   – CNBC (May 6): Medium–high. Almost zero chance May cut; ~33% chance of June cut; experts (Goldman, GSIB, UBS) push first cut to July or later.  
   – CNBC (Mar 19): High quality. Fed left rates unchanged, dot‐plot still shows cuts but shifted further out; officials stress data dependence and tariff risks.  
   – Reuters (Mar 7): High quality. Markets moved first‐cut odds from May to June; Fed officials want more inflation progress and clarity on tariffs.  
   – Scotsman Guide (Apr 25): Medium quality. Cleveland Fed’s Hammack sees June cut possible only with “clear and convincing” data; Waller pushes cuts to post-July if labor shows serious weakness; market‐implied 64% June cut odds.  
   – Historical tightening cycles (Perplexity): Medium quality. Historically, cuts come 7–15 months after final hike; we’re 22 months past our last hike.

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence:  
   • Fed statements (Powell, Williams, Waller, Hammack) uniformly emphasize “no hurry,” waiting for tariff clarity and clear labor/inflation signals.  
   • Reference‐class: past cycles never cut this late with inflation above target; we are beyond typical lag.  
   Moderate evidence:  
   • Market probabilities: CME FedWatch and Reuters show 8–36% odds for June cut; dot‐plot still pushes cuts to July or later.  
   • GDP and inflation data: Q1 GDP slump, Q2 growth picking up; CPI and PCE still above 2%.  
   Weak evidence:  
   • Tariff truce reduces uncertainty but its effect on Fed timing likely delayed beyond June.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – 47 days until July 1; only the June FOMC meeting can trigger a cut.  
   – If timeframe were halved (<24 days), probability would be essentially zero (no meetings).  
   – If doubled (~94 days), July meeting would enter scope and probability would jump dramatically (market implies >50% for July).

5. Justification & inside‐view adjustment  
   Outside‐view base rate (~20%): under reference‐class and historically rare to cut so late with above‐target inflation.  
   Inside‐view shifts:  
   • Tariff truce (minor boost to cut odds) – weak to moderate upward shift (+2 pts).  
   • Strong labor data and sticky inflation – moderate downward shift (−5 pts).  
   • Fed communications and dot‐plot still point to July+ – strong downward shift (−7 pts).  
   • Market‐implied odds for June (<36%) – moderate downward shift (−3 pts).  
   Net shift: −13 pts → 7% from base 20% gives ~7%? But base 20% already incorporates some inside‐view factors. More realistically, net around 18%.

6. Blind‐spot statement  
   If the May data (released mid-June) surprise sharply on the downside—say unemployment jumps or core inflation overshoots/downshifts—that could force an emergency cut in June, making this forecast look too low.

7. Status quo outcome  
   Given the Fed’s bias toward patience and the long lag since last hike, status quo (no June cut) is the most natural outcome.

Probability calibration  
I aim to predict true chance. A 10 point shift is meaningful. My 18% reflects high certainty the Fed will stay put, with small chance of a June surprise cut.

Checklist:  
1. Title/resolution: “Will Fed cut rates before July 1, 2025?” (Yes if any cut announced by then).  
2. Outside‐view base rate: ~20% based on post-2000 cycles.  
3. Consistency check: “18 out of 100 times, Fed cuts by July 1.” Aligns with justification (rare, only one meeting).  
4. Top evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • Fed officials uniformly stress “no hurry,” need tariff/data clarity.  
   • Dot‐plot and market odds push cuts to July or later.  
   • Inflation still above target—historically delays cuts.  
   • Only one meeting remains; odds for emergency cut low.  
5. Blind spot: June data shock forcing an unexpected emergency cut.  
6. Status quo: Fed stays at 4.25–4.50% in June meeting.

Factual: funds-rate 4.25-4.50 %, CME FedWatch shows 8 % chance of a June cut, tariff truce terms, GDPNow 2.3 %, CPI consensus 2.4/2.8 %.  Opinions: Saxo and ING strategists argue hotter CPI keeps Fed on hold.  High-quality for hard market data; expert opinions identifiable.
2. CNBC, 6-May-2025 (Jeff Cox) – Major business network.  Factual: Q1 GDP –0.3 %, Apr payrolls +177 k, futures imply one-third odds of June cut.  Opinions from BNY, Goldman, Nuveen.  Good reliability.
3. Scotsman Guide, 25-Apr-2025 – Trade publication.  Factual: FFR 4.25-4.50 %; Fed officials Hammack & Waller televised remarks.  Market odds 64 % for June (now stale).  Useful quotes, medium reliability for market data (single snapshot).
4. Reuters, 7-Mar-2025 – Global wire.  Labour-market data, discussion of tariff uncertainty.  High source quality.
5. CNBC, 19-Mar-2025 – Post-meeting wrap.  Gives March dot-plot (two 2025 cuts), QT change, Powell quotes.  High reliability.
6. Money, 16-Jan-2025 – Mainstream outlet citing Bank-of-America forecast of zero 2025 cuts.  Solid but older.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• Market-implied probability of a June cut is ~8-10 % (CME FedWatch, 12 May).  Traders directly price FOMC outcomes.
• Only one scheduled meeting (18 Jun) before 1 Jul; emergency inter-meeting cuts are historically rare (3 in 30 yrs ≈ 1 % in any 7-week span).  Structural calendar constraint.

Moderate evidence
• March FOMC “dot plot” still shows two 2025 cuts → directionally supportive but silent on timing.
• Fresh tariff truce removes a key downside risk cited by Powell, decreasing urgency to ease.
• Latest macro: core inflation ~2.8 %, unemployment 4.1 %, GDPNow rebound to +2.3 % → not flashing recession.

Weak evidence
• Political jaw-boning by President Trump – historically little direct effect on timing.
• April 25 futures snapshot (64 % June cut) – superseded by newer data.

Weighting summary: strong evidence points to low (<15 %) odds; moderate evidence adds a small uplift (dots) and small downshift (truce). Net tilt below the 21 % outside view.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time left: 48 days.  If period were halved (24 days) probability would fall to ≈ 5 % (only emergency path).  Doubling would include the late-July meeting, lifting probability to roughly 35 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Start with outside-view 21 %.

– Calendar structure (strong): 95 % of the probability mass must sit on the June meeting.  Historical base rate for a cut at any random meeting in a restrictive-pause phase ≈ 20 %; multiply by 0.95 ⇒ 19 %.  
– Market odds (strong): CME 8-10 %.  Markets routinely beat raw historical frequencies; conservatively regress halfway toward the market: (19 % + 9 %) / 2 ≈ 14 %.  
– Macro data (moderate-to-weak): still-firm labour market, sticky core CPI, tariff truce – all argue against imminent cut → –1 pp → 13 %.  
– Fed forward guidance (“two 2025 cuts”) adds +1 pp because it keeps June alive if May and early-June data weaken → 14 %.  
– Emergency-cut tail 1 % (independent) → 14 % × 0.99 + 1 % ≈ 14 % (rounding unchanged).

Final inside-view probability: 14 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 14 out of 100 times in comparable circumstances the FOMC would announce a rate cut before 1 July 2025.

Checklist:
1. “Fed will announce any reduction in target fed-funds rate before 1 Jul 2025.”  
2. Outside view 21 %; final 14 % anchored to but below base rate.  
3. “14 of 100 times, the Fed cuts before 1 Jul 2025” – reasonable vs evidence.  
4. Key evidence: (i) CME futures ~9 % for June; (ii) only one scheduled meeting; (iii) hot-ish inflation & 4.1 % jobless; (iv) tariff truce eased downside risk.  
5. Blind-spot: Surprise May CPI collapse + sharp payroll drop could jolt emergency cut or June ease – would raise probability sharply.  
6. Status-quo (no cut) favoured by calendar, data momentum and latest market pricing; small nudge toward status-quo already applied.

Probability: 14%
Predicted Probability: 14.0%

**Reuters (March 7, 2025)**
- Facts: Markets shifted expectations from May to June cut; February payrolls +151K; unemployment 4.1%.
- Expert opinions: Governor Waller cited strong labor market for maintaining rates.
- Quality: Two months old; reputable global news agency with Fed official quotes.

**Scotsman Guide (April 25, 2025)**
- Facts: Fed funds rate at 4.25-4.5%; Trump criticized Powell but won't fire him.
- Expert opinions: Beth Hammack (Cleveland Fed) doubts May cut, says June possible with "clear data"; Christopher Waller wouldn't expect impacts "until past July."
- Quality: Recent (3 weeks old); contains direct quotes from current FOMC members.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple FOMC members' recent statements (Waller, Hammack) specifically mentioning timeframes beyond June for likely cuts
- March 2025 dot plot showing only two total cuts for 2025, with four members projecting no cuts
- Inflation persistently above target (core PCE 2.8%, expected April core CPI 2.8%)
- CME FedWatch showing June cut probability plummeting from 64.4% to 8.1% over past month

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Economic resilience despite Q1 contraction (Q2 GDPNow +2.3%, April payrolls +177K)
- US-China tariff truce reducing economic uncertainty that Powell had cited
- Multiple financial institutions (Goldman, BNY, others) specifically forecasting July as earliest cut

**Weak Evidence:**
- Trump's public pressure for rate cuts
- Consumer sentiment at multi-year lows

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The question concerns a cut before July 1, 2025, which is approximately 6-7 weeks from today (May 14, 2025). Based on typical FOMC schedules, there is likely only one remaining meeting before the deadline:
- June 2025 meeting (typically mid-June, around June 18)

If the timeframe were halved (by June 1), probability would approach zero since no FOMC meeting would occur. If doubled (by September 1), probability would increase to 60-70% as it would include the July and potentially August meetings, when most experts expect cuts to begin.

## (d) Justification:

The evidence strongly suggests the Fed is unlikely to cut rates before July 1, 2025:

1. **Direct Fed Communication**: Multiple officials have explicitly mentioned timeframes beyond June. Waller specifically said he doesn't expect significant impacts "until past July." Hammack was "doubtful" about May and conditional about June.

2. **Economic Conditions Don't Warrant Urgent Action**:
   - Inflation remains above target (2.8% core PCE)
   - Labor market remains relatively healthy (April +177K jobs)
   - While Q1 GDP contracted (-0.3%), Q2 is projected to rebound (+2.3%)

3. **Market Expectations Have Shifted Later**: CME FedWatch shows only 8.1% probability of a June cut, down from 64.4% a month ago. Multiple institutional forecasts (Goldman Sachs, BNY, others) specifically point to July or later.

4. **US-China Tariff Resolution**: The recent tariff truce actually reduces uncertainty that Powell had cited as a reason for caution, potentially decreasing the urgency for protective rate cuts.

5. **FOMC's March Projections**: The dot plot showed only two cuts for all of 2025, with four members projecting no cuts, suggesting no urgency to begin cutting in the first half of the year.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view prediction was 17%, which aligns with historical patterns and general economic conditions. Given the strong recent evidence pointing specifically to July rather than June for the first cut, I find this outside view quite accurate.

For a cut to occur before July 1, it would essentially require a decision at the June FOMC meeting (around June 18). The probability of this has fallen dramatically according to market pricing (now at 8.1%). Multiple Fed officials have explicitly indicated caution about cutting before seeing more data.

There are scenarios that could prompt an earlier cut (sharp economic deterioration, market disruption, or surprisingly benign inflation), but these appear unlikely based on recent information. The tariff resolution with China actually reduces uncertainty rather than increasing it.

Given all this evidence, particularly the explicit comments from Fed officials about timeframes beyond June and the sharp decline in market-based probabilities, I calibrate my final probability to 12%.

## Checklist:
1. Question: Will the Federal Reserve announce a reduction in the target federal funds rate before July 1, 2025? (~7 weeks from now)
2. Outside view base rate was 17%, which aligns with current evidence
3. In 12 out of 100 similar situations, the Fed would announce a rate cut in the next 7 weeks
4. Key evidence: FOMC members explicitly mentioning post-June timing; inflation still above target; market probabilities for June cut fell from 64% to 8%
5. Blind spot: Unexpected rapid deterioration in employment data could prompt June cut
6. Status quo is no rate cut; Fed has shown preference for patience and data-dependence

Probability: 12%
Predicted Probability: 12.0%

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:
1. **TheStreet (May 12, 2025)** - High quality, very recent. Fed funds rate at 4.375%; Powell wants tariff clarity before cuts; U.S.-China tariff truce announced; CME FedWatch shows June cut probability at just 8.1% (down from 64.4% a month ago); market now expects first cut no earlier than September.

2. **Money (Jan 16, 2025)** - Medium quality, older article. Bank of America revised forecast to no cuts in 2025; Fed made three cuts in late 2024 to current 4.25-4.5% range; December dot plot showed two cuts for 2025.

3. **CNBC (May 6, 2025)** - High quality, recent. Fed inclined to "do nothing" at May meeting due to economic cross-currents; Q1 GDP fell 0.3% but driven by import surge; CME FedWatch showed ~1-in-3 odds of June cut; economists expect 2-3 cuts in 2025.

4. **CNBC (March 19, 2025)** - High quality, moderate recency. Fed maintained 4.25-4.5% rate; officials still expect two 25bp cuts in 2025; four participants (vs. one in December) now see no cuts in 2025; Powell emphasized rates could stay higher if economy remains strong.

5. **Reuters (March 7, 2025)** - Medium-high quality, somewhat dated. Markets shifting first cut expectation from May to June; labor market showing early softening signs; traders pricing first cut in June with three total in 2025.

6. **Scotsman Guide (April 25, 2025)** - High quality, recent quotes from FOMC members. Beth Hammack (Cleveland Fed) sees June cut possible with "clear and convincing data"; Christopher Waller doesn't expect tariff impacts "until past July"; market showed 64% probability of June cut at that time.

## Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
1. Current Fed funds rate is 4.25-4.5% (4.375% midpoint), unchanged since December 2024 (confirmed across multiple sources).
2. Market-implied probability for a June cut has plummeted from 64.4% to just 8.1% in the past month (TheStreet, May 12).
3. U.S.-China tariff truce announced (TheStreet, May 12), addressing one of Powell's stated conditions but reducing urgency for cuts.
4. Fed Governor Waller explicitly stated he doesn't expect significant tariff impacts "until past July" (Scotsman Guide, April 25).
5. In March, four FOMC members projected no cuts at all in 2025, up from just one in December (CNBC, March 19).

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. Q1 GDP contracted 0.3%, but primarily due to import surges ahead of tariff implementation, not underlying weakness (CNBC, May 6).
2. Inflation remains above target, with core PCE projected at 2.8% and April CPI forecast at 2.4% (CNBC, TheStreet).
3. Cleveland Fed President Hammack indicated a June cut possible with "clear and convincing data" (Scotsman Guide, April 25).
4. Labor market remains relatively strong with 177,000 jobs added in April (CNBC, May 6).

**Weak Evidence:**
1. President Trump pressuring the Fed for rate cuts (Scotsman Guide) - Fed historically maintains independence.
2. Bank of America's January projection of no cuts in 2025 (Money) - somewhat dated single-source forecast.

## Timeframe Analysis:
We have approximately 6-7 weeks until the July 1 resolution date. The only scheduled FOMC meeting in this timeframe is June 10-11, making this the sole opportunity for a rate cut before the deadline (barring an emergency action, which is extremely rare without a crisis).

If the timeframe were halved (3-4 weeks), my prediction would be virtually identical, as we'd still be evaluating the same June meeting. If doubled (12-14 weeks), my probability would increase substantially to ~40-50%, as it would include both the June and July/August FOMC meetings.

## Justification:
The market's dramatic reassessment of June cut probability (from 64.4% to 8.1% in just one month) reflects significant new information, primarily:

1. **Tariff clarity achieved but impact assessment pending:** The U.S.-China tariff truce provides the "clarity" Powell wanted, but Waller specifically stated he doesn't expect to see material impacts "until past July."

2. **Still-elevated inflation:** Core PCE at 2.8% and CPI forecast at 2.4% remain above the Fed's 2% target, giving the committee reason for continued caution.

3. **No economic emergency:** Despite Q1 GDP contraction, domestic demand remains solid, the labor market is healthy, and there are no financial stability concerns that would necessitate an immediate cut.

4. **Increased hawkishness among FOMC members:** The number of officials projecting no 2025 cuts quadrupled from December to March, indicating growing resistance to easing policy.

5. **Explicit market signal:** Traders now price the first cut "no earlier than September" (TheStreet, May 12), suggesting a comprehensive reassessment of the Fed's likely path.

## Probability calibration
Starting with the current market-implied probability of 8.1% for a June cut, I'll consider whether adjustments are warranted:

Factors potentially increasing probability:
- Cleveland Fed President Hammack's statement that June remains possible with the right data
- We still have May jobs and inflation reports before the June meeting
- The Fed has projected two cuts in 2025, and June is a quarterly meeting with press conference

Factors potentially decreasing probability:
- The tariff truce mitigates one concern but doesn't create urgency for cuts
- Inflation remains persistently above target
- FOMC voting members like Waller expect to wait until after July
- No signs of labor market deterioration that would trigger an earlier move

The recent market reassessment from 64.4% to 8.1% for a June cut represents a meaningful integration of new information, particularly the tariff truce and continued strong economic data. However, I'll adjust slightly upward to 13% to account for the possibility of surprisingly weak data in the next jobs or inflation report, which could create the "clear and convincing" case Hammack referenced.

## Checklist:
1. Resolution criteria: Will the Fed announce a reduction in the target federal funds rate before July 1, 2025? (Essentially: Will they cut at the June 10-11 meeting?)

2. Outside view base rate: 17% from initial analysis; current market pricing shows 8.1% for June.

3. Consistency check: 13 out of 100 times, the Fed announces a rate cut at the June meeting - aligns with evidence showing it's possible but unlikely.

4. Key evidence:
   - Market probability for June cut fell from 64.4% to 8.1% in one month
   - Waller expects no significant tariff impacts "until past July"
   - Inflation remains above target (core PCE 2.8%, CPI forecast 2.4%)
   - U.S.-China tariff truce provides clarity but reduces urgency
   - Four FOMC members now project no cuts in 2025 (up from one)

5. Blind-spot: A combination of surprisingly weak May jobs report AND sharp inflation drop could create "clear and convincing" case for June cut.

6. Status quo: Fed has maintained current rate since December; typically moves cautiously when inflation exceeds target.

Probability: 13%
Predicted Probability: 13.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase and resolution  
   Will the Fed cut its target federal funds rate at any FOMC meeting announcement between today (May 14, 2025) and July 1, 2025 (inclusive)? Yes if any reduction is announced, regardless of effective date.

2. Source analysis  
   a. TheStreet (May 12 2025):  
      – Facts: Fed paused at 4.375%, Powell wants “further clarity on tariffs.”  
      – Markets price June cut at 8.1%.  
      – Reliability: mainstream, factual; opinions from identifiable experts (Hardy, Turner).  
   b. Money (Jan 16 2025):  
      – BofA now expects no cuts in 2025 due to sticky inflation, strong labor market.  
      – Markets in mid-Jan priced one cut by June.  
      – Reliability: major bank research; dated but useful for evolving views.  
   c. CNBC (May 6 2025):  
      – Fed “strongly inclined to do nothing” at May 7; no projections until June.  
      – June cut odds ~33%.  
      – Reliability: mainstream, quotes from Reinhart and Mericle.  
   d. CNBC (Mar 19 2025):  
      – Fed held at 4.25–4.50%; dot plot shows two cuts in 2025 but four policymakers see no cuts this year.  
      – Reliability: factual meeting coverage; dissent noted.  
   e. Reuters (Mar 7 2025):  
      – Markets moved first cut to June; labor market mixed signals; policymakers want tariff clarity.  
      – Reliability: high-quality wire service.  
   f. Scotsman Guide (Apr 25 2025):  
      – Cleveland Fed’s Hammack: possible June cut if data clear; Waller expects cuts “once I start seeing serious deterioration…past July.”  
      – Markets price 64% chance June.  
      – Reliability: direct Fed voices; niche publication but quotes original sources.

3. Evidence analysis  
   Strong evidence (large shifts):  
    – Historical Fed cycles show a 7-month minimum lag from last hike/pause to first cut (2000, 2006, 2018). Our pause began Jan 2025 → earliest cut Aug 2025.  
    – Multiple Fed officials (Powell, Williams, Waller, Hammack) publicly emphasize “no hurry” and need for data/clarity.  

   Moderate evidence (medium shifts):  
    – Market-implied odds for a June cut range from 8%–64%; consensus leans to July or later.  
    – Institutional forecasts (JPMorgan, Goldman, BofA, Morgan Stanley) largely push cuts to July or beyond.  

   Weak evidence (small shifts):  
    – One-off GDP swing from import surge; potential that Q2 data disappoint and spur earlier cut.  
    – Political pressure from President Trump for rate relief.

4. Reference‐class/outside‐view base rate  
   Applying the historical “7-month lag” yields effectively 0% probability of a cut before July 1, 2025 (Jan→Aug = 7 months).  

5. Timeframe analysis  
   – Horizon: 48 days, one FOMC meeting (June 18).  
   – If horizon halved (~24 days), no meetings → probability falls toward 0%.  
   – If horizon doubled (~96 days), includes July meeting → probability roughly doubles (to ~24% in our view, all else equal), but still low given slow Fed pace.

6. Inside‐view adjustments  
   Downward shifts:  
    – Strong Fed communications to wait (− large).  
    – Historical precedent (+0% before August).  
   Upward shifts:  
    – Divergence in market odds (some see 64% June) (+ moderate).  
    – Risk of data shock (hard landing fears) (+ small).  
    – One opportunity (June 18 meeting) (+ small).  

7. Justification of probability  
   Given the institutional consensus, Fed rhetoric, and historical pattern, a cut before July 1 is very unlikely. However, non-zero chance arises from:  
    1) June meeting is scheduled.  
    2) Unexpected economic deterioration (e.g., payroll collapse, inflation plunge) between now and mid-June.  
    3) Shifts in Fed dot-plot guidance at the June meeting itself.  

Probability calibration  
Base‐rate from historical lag: ~0%  
+ Market‐implied June odds variance: +8% (lower bound of credible CME pricing)  
+ Expert dissent and data‐shock risk: +4%  
+ Political pressure and tariff clarity: +2%  
= 14% rounded down modestly to account for Fed inertia → 12%

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will the Fed announce a rate cut before July 1, 2025?” – matches resolution.  
2. Outside‐view base rate: 0% (7-month historical lag)  
3. Consistency: 12 out of 100 times, despite pause in Jan 2025 and only one meeting left, a cut is announced.  
4. Top evidence (3–5):  
   • 7-month historical lag (strong)  
   • Fed officials’ “no hurry” messaging (strong)  
   • One June meeting window (moderate)  
   • Market‐implied odds divergence (moderate)  
   • Data‐shock risk (weak)  
5. Blind spot: Rapid collapse of employment/inflation could force an emergency cut—would raise probability to ~50%.  
6. Status quo: Fed tends to move slowly; default is “no cut.”

Predicted Probability: 12.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase and resolution criteria  
   “Will the FOMC announce any reduction in its target federal funds rate between now (May 14, 2025) and July 1, 2025?”  Only the June 17–18 meeting remains before cutoff.

2. Source analysis  
   – TheStreet (May 12): High quality. Reports Powell needs more tariff clarity before cutting; market odds of June cut collapsed to ~8%.  
   – Money (Jan 16): High quality. BofA now expects no cuts in 2025 due to sticky inflation and strong jobs.  
   – CNBC (May 6): Medium–high. Almost zero chance May cut; ~33% chance of June cut; experts (Goldman, GSIB, UBS) push first cut to July or later.  
   – CNBC (Mar 19): High quality. Fed left rates unchanged, dot‐plot still shows cuts but shifted further out; officials stress data dependence and tariff risks.  
   – Reuters (Mar 7): High quality. Markets moved first‐cut odds from May to June; Fed officials want more inflation progress and clarity on tariffs.  
   – Scotsman Guide (Apr 25): Medium quality. Cleveland Fed’s Hammack sees June cut possible only with “clear and convincing” data; Waller pushes cuts to post-July if labor shows serious weakness; market‐implied 64% June cut odds.  
   – Historical tightening cycles (Perplexity): Medium quality. Historically, cuts come 7–15 months after final hike; we’re 22 months past our last hike.

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence:  
   • Fed statements (Powell, Williams, Waller, Hammack) uniformly emphasize “no hurry,” waiting for tariff clarity and clear labor/inflation signals.  
   • Reference‐class: past cycles never cut this late with inflation above target; we are beyond typical lag.  
   Moderate evidence:  
   • Market probabilities: CME FedWatch and Reuters show 8–36% odds for June cut; dot‐plot still pushes cuts to July or later.  
   • GDP and inflation data: Q1 GDP slump, Q2 growth picking up; CPI and PCE still above 2%.  
   Weak evidence:  
   • Tariff truce reduces uncertainty but its effect on Fed timing likely delayed beyond June.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – 47 days until July 1; only the June FOMC meeting can trigger a cut.  
   – If timeframe were halved (<24 days), probability would be essentially zero (no meetings).  
   – If doubled (~94 days), July meeting would enter scope and probability would jump dramatically (market implies >50% for July).

5. Justification & inside‐view adjustment  
   Outside‐view base rate (~20%): under reference‐class and historically rare to cut so late with above‐target inflation.  
   Inside‐view shifts:  
   • Tariff truce (minor boost to cut odds) – weak to moderate upward shift (+2 pts).  
   • Strong labor data and sticky inflation – moderate downward shift (−5 pts).  
   • Fed communications and dot‐plot still point to July+ – strong downward shift (−7 pts).  
   • Market‐implied odds for June (<36%) – moderate downward shift (−3 pts).  
   Net shift: −13 pts → 7% from base 20% gives ~7%? But base 20% already incorporates some inside‐view factors. More realistically, net around 18%.

6. Blind‐spot statement  
   If the May data (released mid-June) surprise sharply on the downside—say unemployment jumps or core inflation overshoots/downshifts—that could force an emergency cut in June, making this forecast look too low.

7. Status quo outcome  
   Given the Fed’s bias toward patience and the long lag since last hike, status quo (no June cut) is the most natural outcome.

Probability calibration  
I aim to predict true chance. A 10 point shift is meaningful. My 18% reflects high certainty the Fed will stay put, with small chance of a June surprise cut.

Checklist:  
1. Title/resolution: “Will Fed cut rates before July 1, 2025?” (Yes if any cut announced by then).  
2. Outside‐view base rate: ~20% based on post-2000 cycles.  
3. Consistency check: “18 out of 100 times, Fed cuts by July 1.” Aligns with justification (rare, only one meeting).  
4. Top evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • Fed officials uniformly stress “no hurry,” need tariff/data clarity.  
   • Dot‐plot and market odds push cuts to July or later.  
   • Inflation still above target—historically delays cuts.  
   • Only one meeting remains; odds for emergency cut low.  
5. Blind spot: June data shock forcing an unexpected emergency cut.  
6. Status quo: Fed stays at 4.25–4.50% in June meeting.

2. CNBC, 6-May-2025 (Jeff Cox) – Major business network.  Factual: Q1 GDP –0.3 %, Apr payrolls +177 k, futures imply one-third odds of June cut.  Opinions from BNY, Goldman, Nuveen.  Good reliability.
3. Scotsman Guide, 25-Apr-2025 – Trade publication.  Factual: FFR 4.25-4.50 %; Fed officials Hammack & Waller televised remarks.  Market odds 64 % for June (now stale).  Useful quotes, medium reliability for market data (single snapshot).
4. Reuters, 7-Mar-2025 – Global wire.  Labour-market data, discussion of tariff uncertainty.  High source quality.
5. CNBC, 19-Mar-2025 – Post-meeting wrap.  Gives March dot-plot (two 2025 cuts), QT change, Powell quotes.  High reliability.
6. Money, 16-Jan-2025 – Mainstream outlet citing Bank-of-America forecast of zero 2025 cuts.  Solid but older.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• Market-implied probability of a June cut is ~8-10 % (CME FedWatch, 12 May).  Traders directly price FOMC outcomes.
• Only one scheduled meeting (18 Jun) before 1 Jul; emergency inter-meeting cuts are historically rare (3 in 30 yrs ≈ 1 % in any 7-week span).  Structural calendar constraint.

Moderate evidence
• March FOMC “dot plot” still shows two 2025 cuts → directionally supportive but silent on timing.
• Fresh tariff truce removes a key downside risk cited by Powell, decreasing urgency to ease.
• Latest macro: core inflation ~2.8 %, unemployment 4.1 %, GDPNow rebound to +2.3 % → not flashing recession.

Weak evidence
• Political jaw-boning by President Trump – historically little direct effect on timing.
• April 25 futures snapshot (64 % June cut) – superseded by newer data.

Weighting summary: strong evidence points to low (<15 %) odds; moderate evidence adds a small uplift (dots) and small downshift (truce). Net tilt below the 21 % outside view.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time left: 48 days.  If period were halved (24 days) probability would fall to ≈ 5 % (only emergency path).  Doubling would include the late-July meeting, lifting probability to roughly 35 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Start with outside-view 21 %.

– Calendar structure (strong): 95 % of the probability mass must sit on the June meeting.  Historical base rate for a cut at any random meeting in a restrictive-pause phase ≈ 20 %; multiply by 0.95 ⇒ 19 %.  
– Market odds (strong): CME 8-10 %.  Markets routinely beat raw historical frequencies; conservatively regress halfway toward the market: (19 % + 9 %) / 2 ≈ 14 %.  
– Macro data (moderate-to-weak): still-firm labour market, sticky core CPI, tariff truce – all argue against imminent cut → –1 pp → 13 %.  
– Fed forward guidance (“two 2025 cuts”) adds +1 pp because it keeps June alive if May and early-June data weaken → 14 %.  
– Emergency-cut tail 1 % (independent) → 14 % × 0.99 + 1 % ≈ 14 % (rounding unchanged).

Final inside-view probability: 14 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 14 out of 100 times in comparable circumstances the FOMC would announce a rate cut before 1 July 2025.

Checklist:
1. “Fed will announce any reduction in target fed-funds rate before 1 Jul 2025.”  
2. Outside view 21 %; final 14 % anchored to but below base rate.  
3. “14 of 100 times, the Fed cuts before 1 Jul 2025” – reasonable vs evidence.  
4. Key evidence: (i) CME futures ~9 % for June; (ii) only one scheduled meeting; (iii) hot-ish inflation & 4.1 % jobless; (iv) tariff truce eased downside risk.  
5. Blind-spot: Surprise May CPI collapse + sharp payroll drop could jolt emergency cut or June ease – would raise probability sharply.  
6. Status-quo (no cut) favoured by calendar, data momentum and latest market pricing; small nudge toward status-quo already applied.

Probability: 14%
Predicted Probability: 14.0%...
