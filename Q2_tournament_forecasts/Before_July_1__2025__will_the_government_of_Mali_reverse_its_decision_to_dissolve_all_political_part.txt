Analysis:
This question hinges on whether Mali’s current military rulers—who on May 13, 2025, issued a decree dissolving all parties—will backtrack before July 1, 2025. To form an outside‐view baseline, we need historical cases of Mali’s own past coups (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2024) and how transitional charters treated parties, plus analogous West African military takeovers. Key contexts include: timelines for reinstating parties in prior juntas; internal resistance (civil society, traditional leaders); regional/ECOWAS pressure; and whether partial rollbacks occurred. By understanding these precedents, we can gauge the likelihood and probable timing of a reversal.

Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether Mali’s government will reverse its May 13 decree dissolving all political parties lies in understanding both historical patterns of military regimes in Mali and current pressures—domestic, regional, and international. Historically, Malian juntas (e.g., post-2020 coup) have made concessions only under significant external or internal pressure, as seen when ECOWAS sanctions led to a reluctant agreement on elections in 2021. Our out-view baseline is “no reversal” (low probability) given the junta’s track record of entrenching power. For an inside view, we need up-to-date information on:
• Domestic political party reactions: protests, legal challenges, or negotiations.  
• ECOWAS/AU/UN statements or sanctions threat regarding the dissolution.  
• Any shifts in the junta’s rhetoric or internal splits within the military leadership.  
• International diplomatic activity (e.g., France, UN envoy) pressing for party reinstatement.  
Gathering this information will inform whether significant pressure has built that could plausibly flip the junta’s stance before July 1, 2025.

Here is a concise summary of the TRT Global article “Mali’s transitional president dissolves political parties”:

• Decree dissolving parties  
  – On a Tuesday in mid-May 2025, Mali’s military government issued a presidency decree dissolving “political parties and political organisations” and banning all meetings of their members.  
  – This followed an earlier suspension on May 7 of party activities, justified by authorities citing “risk of disturbances to public order.”

• Background: April “national assembly”  
  – A late-April national assembly—widely boycotted by the opposition—recommended both the suspension (and thus dissolution) of parties and granting junta chief Gen. Assimi Goïta a five-year, renewable presidential term without a vote.  
  – Goïta approved the suspension of the political parties charter hours before the full dissolution decree was read on national TV.

• Impact on opposition  
  – Since coups in August 2020 and May 2021, the junta has imposed retaliatory measures, legal actions and dissolved various associations, significantly weakening dissent.  
  – Roughly 100 opposition parties formed a coalition to demand a return to civilian rule by December 2025; they drew several hundred protesters in Bamako in early May.

• Official justifications & dissenting views  
  – Abdou Salam Diepkile, Director-General of Territorial Administration, told ORTM that repealing the law “does not call into question the existence of political parties” and aims to “stop the proliferation of political parties.”  
  – Former Justice Minister Mamadou Ismaila Konaté, in an op-ed, argued the junta seeks “to systematically demolish political countervailing powers.”

• Media restrictions  
  – Mali’s communications regulator suspended French channel TV 5 Monde—citing lack of “impartiality” in its May 3 protest coverage—and has permanently banned France 24 and Radio France Internationale.

Source: RFI, May 14, 2025 (state television announcement)

1. Facts and developments  
- On Tuesday the military government issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties, banning their activities nationwide and scrapping the national charter on political parties. Anyone defying the order faces sanctions.  
- The measures followed an emergency government meeting. Mamani Nassiré, minister for political reform and the electoral process, said: “We are in a process of reforms,” and that new laws will be drafted to manage political life.  
- The stated goals are to reduce the number of parties, make it harder to create new ones and potentially end public funding. Civil servants appointed through parties may remain in their posts but may not speak or act on their party’s behalf.  
- Protests began in early May; on May 3–4 hundreds demonstrated in Bamako chanting “Down with dictatorship, long live democracy” (Reuters). Authorities suspended political activity on the previous Friday, forcing the cancellation of an opposition protest.  
- Three opposition figures are now feared abducted:  
  • Abba Alhassane (secretary general of CODEM), arrested by “masked gunmen claiming to be gendarmes” (Human Rights Watch)  
  • El Bachir Thiam (leader of Yelema), reportedly seized by “unidentified men” in Kati  
  • Abdoul Karim Traoré (CODEM youth leader), missing for two days, per a Reuters source  
- The military government had pledged elections in February 2022; the transition to civilian rule has repeatedly been delayed.

2. Opinions and reactions  
Reliable sources  
- Human Rights Watch documents the arrest of opposition figures by security forces.  
- Reuters reports on the May protests and missing activists.

Less-reliable or unnamed sources (all speaking anonymously)  
- “No surprise. We will continue to fight, even in the shadows. This dissolution adds to Mali’s already numerous problems,” said one activist.  
- “A logical continuation, but serious and unprecedented,” said a former minister.  
- “Our ideas will be expressed one way or another. Their only concern is keeping power. The struggle will be organised and we will win,” said another opposition figure.  
- An opponent commented, “With this decree, we have officially returned to dictatorship,” invoking Mali’s 1236 Mandé Charter as proof of a democratic tradition.

3. Context  
- The decree follows last month’s national conference that also granted military leader Assimi Goïta a five-year presidential term.  
- Observers see the move as a return to autocratic rule reminiscent of General Moussa Traoré’s regime (1968–1991).

Summary of France 24 article (April 11, 2024)

– Facts  
• On April 10, 2024, Mali’s ruling military junta issued a decree indefinitely suspending all political-party activities “to maintain public order,” citing “subversive acts” and “sterile discussions” that hinder the fight against jihadist and separatist groups.  
• On April 11, Mali’s High Authority for Communication ordered all media—radio, TV, print and online—to halt coverage of political parties and “activities of a political nature” by associations. The decree did not specify penalties for non-compliance.  
• The junta seized power in a 2020 coup, overthrew President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, and had pledged under ECOWAS pressure to hold elections by March 26, 2024—an election that has not taken place.  

– Government source (reliable)  
• Colonel Abdoulaye Maïga, government spokesman, said party activities amounted to “subversive acts” and that “sterile political debates” could not help defeat armed jihadist or Tuareg separatist groups.  

– Opposition figures (named sources)  
• Moussa Mara (Prime Minister 2014–15) called the suspension “a major step backwards” that “does not promise a peaceful future” and urged its reversal.  
• Housseini Amion Guindo, president of the Convergence for the Development of Mali (CODEM) party, urged “civil disobedience until the fall of the illegal and illegitimate regime,” blaming it for failing to meet Malians’ essential needs.  

– International and civil-society reactions (reliable sources)  
• United Nations rights office (on X/Twitter): “Deeply concerned by the decree suspending the activities of political parties and other civic associations … it must be immediately repealed.”  
• Reporters Without Borders (RSF): Described the media ban as “a censorship measure that is part of the continuum of muzzling of information” under the junta.  
• Maison de la Presse (NGO umbrella group for part of Mali’s media): Urged outlets “not to submit to the orders” of the communications authority.  
• In a March 31 joint statement, a coalition of political parties and civil groups decried the “legal and institutional vacuum” from the failure to return to civilian rule and called for “rapid and inclusive dialogue” to hold presidential elections “as soon as possible.”  
• A separate March 31 statement by unnamed human-rights organizations said Mali had “reached an impasse” and urged the military “to return to the barracks.”  

– Broader context  
• Since the 2020 coup, the junta has ended ties with the EU and France, strengthened relations with Russia, ordered the withdrawal of the UN’s MINUSMA mission, and scrapped a 2015 peace deal with northern separatists.  
• Mali faces a worsening security situation compounded by humanitarian and political crises. Neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger also remain under military rule after 2022–23 coups, and all three have pledged to leave ECOWAS for a Sahel alliance.

Here is a concise summary of the BBC’s August 30, 2023 article “Gabon coup: The latest in a series of military takeovers on the continent”:

1. Recent surge in African coups  
   • After decades of relative democratic stability, coups are rising again.  
   • In 2021 there were six coup attempts in Africa (four successful); in 2022 five attempts (two successful).  
   • In 2023, Gabon’s takeover came a month after Niger’s coup; Burkina Faso had two successful coups in 2022.

2. Long-term coup statistics  
   • US researchers Jonathan Powell and Clayton Thyne identify over 200 coup attempts in Africa since the 1950s; roughly half succeeded.  
   • Average rate from 1960–2000 was ~4 attempts per year; this fell post-2000 but has climbed again since 2020.

3. Regional coup “hotspots”  
   • Sudan: 17 coups/attempts since independence, six successful (including 1989’s al-Bashir takeover).  
   • Burkina Faso: 10 attempts (nine successful) – the highest success rate on the continent.  
   • Nigeria: eight coups between 1966–1993; democratic transfers have held since 1999.  
   • Burundi: 11 coups, driven by Hutu–Tutsi tensions.  
   • Sierra Leone: three coups in 1967–68, one in 1971, plus five attempts in 1992–97.  
   • Ghana: eight coups over roughly two decades from 1966.

4. Definitions and denials  
   • A coup is “an illegal and overt attempt by the military—or by other civilian officials—to unseat sitting leaders.” (Powell & Thyne)  
   • Coup leaders often deny the label to claim legitimacy (e.g., Zimbabwe 2017, Maj-Gen Sibusiso Moyo).

5. Drivers and expert perspectives  
   • Poverty, poor economic performance, and a history of instability create coup-prone conditions. (Powell)  
   • Popular uprisings against dictators can open the door to military intervention. (Ndubuisi Christian Ani, University of KwaZulu-Natal)  
   • Moussa Faki Mahamat (African Union Chair) has warned of a “resurgence of unconstitutional changes of government.”  
   • UN Secretary-General António Guterres (2021): “Military coups are back… geo-political divisions… a sense of impunity is taking hold.”

6. Global context  
   • Of 18 coups worldwide since 2017, all but one (Myanmar, 2021) have occurred in Africa, making it the continent with the highest coup incidence.

# Military Dissolution and Reinstatement of Political Parties in West Africa: Patterns and Precedents  

The dissolution and subsequent reinstatement of political parties under military regimes in West Africa have become recurring phenomena, reflecting broader struggles between authoritarian consolidation and democratic resilience. This report examines key cases in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, analyzing timelines, triggering events, international responses, and conditions for reinstatement.  

---

## Mali: A Cycle of Suspension, Dissolution, and Limited Reversals  

### **Phase 1: Initial Coup and Early Restrictions (2020–2023)**  
Mali’s military seized power in August 2020, ousting President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. The junta, led by Colonel Assimi Goïta, initially pledged a transitional government and elections by February 2022. However, delays ensued, with authorities citing security challenges and the need for institutional reforms[3][6].  

### **Phase 2: Escalating Repression (2023–2024)**  
By April 2024, the junta suspended political party activities and media coverage of opposition groups, citing “public order” concerns[9][15]. This followed protests by over 80 parties demanding a return to constitutional rule[12]. The suspension was partially lifted in July 2024 after national dialogue recommendations, though critics dismissed the process as illegitimate[11][13].  

### **Phase 3: Full Dissolution (2025)**  
On 13 May 2025, Goïta’s regime formally dissolved all political parties via presidential decree, leveraging outcomes from a state-controlled national consultation[1][5][7]. The consultation, boycotted by most parties, endorsed Goïta’s presidency until 2030 and aligned Mali with neighboring junta-led states[1][5]. Protests erupted in Bamako but were suppressed[3][6].  

#### **Triggering Events**  
- **April 2024 Suspension**: Direct response to opposition demands for elections[9][12].  
- **May 2025 Dissolution**: Preemptive move to neutralize dissent ahead of proposed five-year junta rule[1][7].  

#### **International Pressure**  
- The UN and Human Rights Watch condemned the 2024 suspension as violating freedom of association[9][15].  
- Regional bodies like ECOWAS, weakened by Mali’s 2023 withdrawal, lacked leverage[6][15].  

#### **Reinstatement Conditions**  
The July 2024 lifting of suspensions was conditional on parties abstaining from “subversion” and supporting the junta’s agenda[11][14]. No reinstatement followed the 2025 dissolution, which remains in effect[5][7].  

---

## Niger: Mirroring the Sahelian Authoritarian Playbook  

### **Post-Coup Dissolution (2023–2025)**  
After General Abdourahamane Tchiani’s July 2023 coup, political activities were suspended and parties dissolved by March 2025[16][17]. A national conference orchestrated by the junta ratified Tchiani’s five-year term and abolished multiparty democracy[17].  

#### **Triggering Events**  
- **July 2023 Coup**: Justified as a response to “poor governance” under President Mohamed Bazoum[19].  
- **March 2025 Dissolution**: Part of a broader institutional overhaul codified in the Refoundation Charter[17].  

#### **International Reactions**  
- The Socialist International denounced the dissolution as anti-democratic[16].  
- Regional allies (Mali, Burkina Faso) endorsed the move, isolating Niger from ECOWAS[17].  

#### **Reinstatement Prospects**  
As of mid-2025, no parties have been reinstated. The junta linked future political participation to adherence to its charter, which prioritizes “national unity”[17].  

---

## Burkina Faso: Incremental Suppression and Legal Challenges  

### **Post-Coup Restrictions (2022–2024)**  
Following Captain Ibrahim Traoré’s September 2022 coup, political activities were suspended indefinitely[18]. The ban faced legal challenges, such as the Union for Progress and Change (UPC) petitioning courts in 2024[18].  

#### **Triggering Events**  
- **September 2022 Coup**: Part of a regional trend of military takeovers[18].  
- **Ongoing Suppression**: Justified as necessary for “stability” amid jihadist conflicts[18].  

#### **International and Domestic Pushback**  
- Civil society groups criticized the suspensions as unconstitutional[18].  
- Limited ECOWAS pressure due to Burkina Faso’s alliance with Mali and Niger[6][18].  

#### **Conditions for Reinstatement**  
No formal reinstatement occurred by 2025. The junta implied that normalization would follow “pacification” of security crises[18].  

---

## Comparative Analysis: Trends and Implications  

### **Common Triggers**  
1. **Preemptive Neutralization of Opposition**: Dissolutions often preceded proposed election timelines (e.g., Mali’s 2025 dissolution ahead of Goïta’s extended term)[1][7].  
2. **Security Justifications**: Regimes cited terrorism or public order to legitimize crackdowns[9][15][18].  
3. **Regional Authoritarian Solidarity**: Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso aligned policies, including party bans, to consolidate junta rule[1][17].  

### **Reinstatement Patterns**  
- **Temporary Reversals**: Mali’s 2024 suspension lift was tactical, aimed at legitimizing staged dialogues[11][14].  
- **Permanent Dissolutions**: Post-2023 bans in Niger and Mali lack sunset clauses, indicating long-term authoritarian visions[5][17].  

### **International Community’s Diminished Role**  
- ECOWAS’s influence waned after member states withdrew in 2023[6][15].  
- Western powers (France, U.S.) prioritized counterterrorism over democratic governance, enabling junta entrenchment[13][15].  

---

## Conclusion: Democratic Erosion in the Sahel  

The dissolution-reinstatement cycle in West Africa reflects military regimes’ strategic use of legal and coercive tools to suppress dissent. While temporary reinstatements serve tactical purposes, the broader trend points to institutionalized authoritarianism, exacerbated by regional alliances and international apathy. Without renewed multilateral pressure or internal mobilization, the prospects for multiparty democracy in the Sahel remain bleak.

Key facts and developments  
• On May 14, 2025, Mali’s ruling junta issued a decree suspending all political‐party activities “until further notice,” citing public‐order concerns amid growing protests against its crackdown on dissent.  
• On April 30, 2025, Mali’s transitional legislature adopted a bill repealing basic legal protections for political participation—interpreted by legal experts as a step toward fully dissolving parties.  

Named UN experts’ positions  
• Three independent UN human-rights experts (the UN’s top independent expert on Mali plus the special rapporteurs on freedom of expression and on peaceful assembly) issued a joint statement condemning both measures.  
• They demand the immediate repeal of the decree suspending party activities, calling it a “violation of basic human rights.”  
• They warn that the new bill—by imposing onerous financial deposits for party registration and candidacies—would contravene Mali’s obligations on freedoms of association and expression, effectively restricting political participation to wealthy actors.  
• They reject the junta’s portrayal of these steps as outcomes of national dialogues meant to curb party proliferation, noting that genuine consultation is impossible under a climate of civic‐space suppression.  

Rights of peaceful assembly  
• Ahead of planned rallies on Friday by opposition parties, the experts stress that the right to peaceful assembly “is essential to the health of a vibrant political community.”  
• They call on Mali’s transitional authorities to respect this right fully and to refrain from intimidation or repression that could endanger demonstrators’ safety.

<Summary source="https://issafrica.org/iss-today/mali-s-transition-is-at-risk-as-political-parties-are-dissolved">
Here is a concise summary of the ISS Africa article “Mali’s transition is at risk as political parties are dissolved” (ISS Today):

• On 13 May 2025, Mali’s military transitional authority issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties (nearly 300 in total, though most were inactive).  
• This marks a major setback for Mali’s five-year transition to multiparty democracy following the August 2020 coup led by Colonel Assimi Goïta.  
• Authorities justify the move based on April’s national “consultations” (widely boycotted by the political class) that recommended:
  – Dissolving political parties and  
  – Revising the Transition Charter to install Goïta as president for a renewable five-year term from 2025 (the latter was not formally on the consultation agenda).  
• Consultations also stressed aligning Mali’s governance with its allies Niger and Burkina Faso—both now under military regimes that have likewise suspended party activity and secured renewable presidential terms via similar processes.  
• Unlike in Niger and Burkina Faso, Mali’s political parties have publicly resisted:
  – On 30 April, they protested a bill repealing party-regulation laws.  
  – On 3–4 May, they rallied hundreds in Bamako demanding a return to constitutional order by 31 December—demonstrations that police and pro-government groups disrupted.  
  – Planned protests for 9 May were called off after the authorities suspended party and association activities “until further notice” on 7 May.  
• This level of organized, public defiance is unprecedented under Mali’s post-2020 military authorities and signals the political class is still a force to be reckoned with.  
• The article warns that heavy-handed repression may backfire by:
  – Reviving popular attachment to the 1991 March Revolution that overthrew Moussa Traoré’s dictatorship, uniting older activists and younger generations.  
  – Fueling broader public protests amid widespread discontent: frequent power outages since 2023 have weakened industry and informal livelihoods; heavy military spending strains state finances; and new taxes on phone calls and mobile-money transfers are deeply unpopular.  
• The authors argue Mali’s leaders should engage all political actors in drafting a new Charter of Political Parties and an electoral roadmap to end the transition, rather than further close the political space.  
• Although Mali’s AU membership remains suspended, Article 25(3) of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance obliges the AU to help restore democracy. The AU could, for example, deploy its “Africa Facility to Support Inclusive Transitions” (in partnership with UNDP) to facilitate dialogue, offer technical and financial assistance, or appoint a neutral facilitator.

**Mali protests demand end to military rule, junta bans politics – The Militant**
Hundreds of people in Mali protested against the military government's announcement that junta ruler Assimi Goita would be named president through 2030, and all political parties and activity were dissolved. The protesters, who rallied outside the Palais de Culture, chanted against the dictatorship and called the move a 'direct attack on the constitution and the sovereignty of the Malian people.' The military government has repeatedly postponed elections, and protesters are demanding an end to military rule. The junta has also banned larger protests and arrested a vocal critic of the regime, Mamadou Traoré, who is charged with 'spreading knowingly false news likely to disturb public order.' The military governments in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso face Jihadi attacks and have turned to Moscow for help, but the situation remains dire for the toilers, with 400,000 people uprooted from their homes in the past year. The only road forward is for the toilers to develop a leadership that can lead them to take political power into their own hands and take control of their own destiny, as seen in the popular, democratic revolution that brought Thomas Sankara to power in Burkina Faso in 1983-1987.

**Mali dissolves all political parties, sparking international concern**
The Malian military junta has dissolved all political parties in the country, a move that has been met with criticism from the international community. The decision was announced on May 13, 2025, by a presidential decree, following national consultations and popular discussions. The move is seen as a consolidation of the junta's power and a step towards authoritarian rule. The Malian people are left with limited means of public expression, with the government controlling the media and restricting freedom of speech. However, analysts argue that the people still have the right to express themselves, and that the dissolution of political parties is a move to prolong the military's power. The Malian diaspora has also spoken out against the decision, with some calling for a return to democratic rule. The government has justified the move by citing the need to preserve national unity and stability, but critics argue that it is a power grab by the military. The international community has expressed concern over the move, with some countries calling for the restoration of democratic rule in Mali.

**Regional Victory**
Forty-six Ivorian soldiers who were detained in Mali for six months were welcomed home on January 7, 2023, after being pardoned and released from a 20-year prison sentence. The soldiers were detained in July 2022 for working for a private company contracted by the United Nations in Mali, which the Malian government considered an act of undermining State security. The regional bloc, led by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), played a key role in mediating the release, with President Faure Gnassingbe and President Umaro Sisseco ensuring a dialogue between the two nations. Unlike in the past, the regional leaders showed mastery in handling the issue, opting for a more diplomatic approach instead of imposing sanctions.

**ANALYSIS: Mali’s transition at risk as political parties are dissolved**
Mali's military transitional authority has dissolved the country's political parties, but the move has sparked defiance from the political class. The decision, made on May 13, has been met with resistance, with many parties fighting back. This is a major setback for Mali's prospects of remaining a multiparty democracy. However, the country's political parties are positioning themselves as a force that cannot be ignored in shaping the transition. The public defiance is the first of its kind since Mali's military authorities took hold in August 2020. The move could unite the elders who fought against Traoré's dictatorship with youths who grew up under democracy, fueling public protests and heightening concerns over Mali's democratic transition. The authorities should consider dialogue with all political forces, rather than restricting the political space. This is in line with the government's intention to draw up a new legislative framework that better organises and regulates the political sector. The African Union (AU) could play a role in resolving the tensions, offering support to Malian authorities and the political class in facilitating dialogue or appointing a facilitator acceptable to all parties.

**Mali protests demand end to military rule, junta bans politics – The Militant**
Hundreds of people in Mali protested against the military government's announcement that junta ruler Assimi Goita would be named president through 2030, and all political parties and activity were dissolved. The protesters, who rallied outside the Palais de Culture, chanted against the dictatorship and called the move a 'direct attack on the constitution and the sovereignty of the Malian people.' The military government has repeatedly postponed elections, and protesters are demanding an end to military rule. The junta has also banned larger protests and arrested a vocal critic of the regime, Mamadou Traoré, who is charged with 'spreading knowingly false news likely to disturb public order.' The military governments in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso face Jihadi attacks and have turned to Moscow for help, but the situation remains dire for the toilers, with 400,000 people uprooted from their homes in the past year. The only road forward is for the toilers to develop a leadership that can lead them to take political power into their own hands and take control of their own destiny, as seen in the popular, democratic revolution that brought Thomas Sankara to power in Burkina Faso in 1983-1987.

**Gowon proposes ECOWAS name change to bring back Mali, others**
General Yakubu Gowon, the only living founding father of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has proposed a name change to ECOWASS to entice the exiting states of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger to come back into the fold. Gowon expressed sadness over the exit of the three member-states following sanctions by ECOWAS leaders after military coups. He said, 'Now, that was sad, because we had thought we had finished with people leaving ECOWAS.' Gowon suggested that the name change would help to bring the countries back into the community, saying, 'I believe in myself, in what our government is doing and what the President of Ghana is doing at the moment. I'm sure it will soon probably bring the desired result.' The ECOWAS Commission has left the doors open for the exiting countries to return, and Gowon is hopeful that they will come back. He said, 'ECOWAS hasn't got to change its name, but we hope we will do everything possible to bring them back.'

**UN Calls on Mali to Repeal Decree Dissolving Political Parties**
The United Nations has called on the Mali government to repeal a decree dissolving political parties. The High Commissioner, Volker Türk, stated, 'The President of the transition must repeal this draconian decree and any restriction on political participation must be in line with Mali's international obligations on human rights.' The military junta has dissolved political parties after they organized a protest in Bamako on May 3 to denounce the possibility of dissolution and demand the return of civilians to power. TV5 Monde was also suspended 'until further notice' for alleged lack of impartiality. At least three opposition members were arrested during the protests, with their whereabouts unknown. The High Commissioner expressed concern that these arrests are part of a series of enforced disappearances dating back to 2021, and urged authorities to release those arrested for political reasons. He warned that laws limiting political participation 'risk silencing dissenting voices in the country and could exacerbate broader human rights issues'.

**UN Calls for Revocation of Decree Dissolving Political Parties in Mali**
The United Nations (UN) has called for the revocation of a decree that dissolved political parties in Mali. Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated, 'The President of the transition should revoke this draconian decree and any restrictions on political participation must respect Mali's international obligations on human rights.' Türk warned that restrictive laws 'risk silencing dissenting voices in the country and may exacerbate broader human rights problems.' He urged authorities to 'protect civic space and ensure an environment where everyone can enjoy all their rights, including freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.' The ruling junta dissolved political parties after they organized a protest in Bamako, the capital of Mali, on May 3 to denounce the possibility and demand the return of civilians to power. At least three opposition members were detained after the protests, and their whereabouts are unknown. Türk lamented that these are 'the latest victims of a series of enforced disappearances dating back to at least 2021,' and called on authorities to release people detained for political reasons. The military, which has been in power since two coups in 2020 and 2021, failed to honor its commitment to hand over power to elected civilians in March 2024. Türk asked the junta not to prolong the transition period and to publish an electoral calendar 'without delay.' Mali has been experiencing a deep economic and security crisis since 2012, fueled by extremist violence and communal criminal groups. According to the ACDH, the number of documented human rights violations increased by almost 120% between 2023 and 2024. The ACDH reported attacks on civilians by extremist groups and alleged that Malian military members, accompanied by foreign military personnel known as 'Wagner' or 'Africa Corps,' killed dozens of people last month. Some victims were summarily executed after being detained in Sebagougou, in the southwest of the Kayes region, according to the UN. Türk demanded that 'the multiple investigations announced by Malian authorities into these attacks and killings be carried out as quickly as possible and those responsible be brought to justice.'

**Mali 'in a long and dark tunnel' after dissolution of political parties**
The military junta in Mali has dissolved all political parties and organizations by presidential decree, according to a May 13, 2025, decree. This decision is seen as a step towards consolidating power in the hands of General Assimi Goïta, who has been in control since the coup in 2020. The move is a 'terrible regression' for a country that once embodied a unique blend of cultural authenticity and democratic promise. The dissolution of political parties is a 'nightmare' that will be remembered as a 'date of regret and sadness' when Mali eventually returns to the path of reason. The new Constitution adopted in 2023 guarantees the republican form of government, laïcité, and multipartism, but these promises have been abandoned. The next step seems to be to confer the title of President of the Republic on General Goïta, with a five-year renewable mandate. This move is seen as a 'confiscation of the people's will' and a 'denial of the people's voice'.

**Mali's Military Govt Announces Dissolution Of Political Parties**
Mali's military government has dissolved all political parties in the country, a decision that was validated by military leader Assimi Goita. This move comes after a national conference recommended naming Goita as president with a five-year mandate and dissolving the parties. The decision has sparked protests in Bamako, with critics calling for multi-party elections and chanting slogans against dictatorship. The junta had originally committed to holding elections in February 2022, but has since suspended political activities, forcing opposition parties to cancel their gatherings. Human Rights Watch has reported the arrest of three opposition politicians, including Abba Alhassane, secretary general of the Convergence for the Development of Mali (CODEM), and El Bachir Thiam, leader of the Yelema party. A member of CODEM has expressed fears that another party youth leader, Abdoul Karim Traore, may have been abducted. 'The party has not heard from him for two days,' the member said, speaking on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. 'We fear the worst.'

**Mali dissolves all political parties, organizations**
Mali's military leader, Gen. Assimi Goita, has dissolved all political parties and organizations in the West African nation. According to a presidential decree, all activities and gatherings linked to these dissolved groups are banned, including meetings, support efforts, and leadership roles. The administration warned that any violation of this decree will result in penalties under applicable laws and regulations. This move comes after the suspension of all political parties and organizations last week. Mali has been ruled by the military since coups in 2020 and 2021, and the administration had previously pledged to hold elections and hand power back to civilians by the end of March 2024, but the vote was postponed indefinitely.

**Mali Dissolves Political Parties and Organizations, Opposition Fears**
The military government in Mali has announced the dissolution of 'political parties and organizations with a political character' in a presidential decree broadcast on national television, a decision feared by opposition parties for several weeks. Kadida Fofana, a former municipal counselor and activist, joins us to discuss this development. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, hundreds of people have been arrested during security operations in Goma, in the east of the country. The operations are being carried out by the M23 rebels, who have controlled the provincial capital since late January. The trauma of recent fighting has added to the tense situation, with almost four months having passed since the M23 took control of Goma. The ICRC has set up listening houses to help adults and children cope with stress and trauma. Meanwhile, Orano has decided to file a complaint with the Niger prosecutor's office for arbitrary arrest, illegal detention, and unjustified confiscation of property belonging to Nigerien companies, following the security forces' raids on its offices last week. The decision comes in response to the Nigerien security forces' incursion into the offices of Somair, Cominak, and Orano Mining Niger in Niamey on May 5, during which the director of the latter was reportedly taken to the DGSE. The Republic of Benin has officially recovered a 'kataklè', a tripodal stool that was the 27th work of its royal treasure pillaged by French colonial troops at the end of the 19th century and was on display in a Finnish museum. This restitution, which took place at the presidential palace in Cotonou, completes the 26 works of the Abomey treasure returned to Benin in November 2021 by France.

**Mali's Military Junta Dissolves All Political Parties**
The military junta in Mali, led by Assimi Goita, has issued a decree dissolving all political parties and organizations in the country. The move, which includes sanctions for non-compliance, was announced by the Minister of Political Reforms, Mamani Nassiré, following a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, according to the state-owned Malian newspaper 'L'Essor'. This decision comes after the Transitional Parliament approved the revocation of the law on political parties with 130 votes in favor and two against, following the approval of the National Transitional Council (CNT), whose members were appointed by the junta. The move has been met with opposition protests, who denounce an attack on pluralism in the African country. Goita's junta, which came to power after the 2020 and 2021 uprisings, has failed to uphold its commitment to holding elections and returning power to civilians, amidst allegations of Goita's attempts to perpetuate himself in power and maintain the influence of the Armed Forces in the country's politics. Bamako has since drawn closer to Russia and distanced itself from France and Western governments, including its exit from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the creation of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) with the military juntas of Burkina Faso and Niger.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Britannica (May 21, 2025): High-quality tertiary source on Mali’s political-party history from 1946 onward. Purely factual; no near-term perspective on the 2025 decree.  
- TRT Global (mid-May 2025): Gives factual detail on the May 13 decree dissolving parties, opposition boycott of the April “national assembly,” and expert/legal opinions (Diepkile, Konaté). Medium-quality: reliable factual reporting with named sources; opinions clearly tagged.  
- RFI (May 14, 2025): State-television transcript of the decree, details on arrests, protests and planned reforms. High reliability for facts; few opinion slips, which are attributable to opposition figures.  
- France 24 (April 11, 2024): Describes the junta’s indefinite suspension of all party activities and media blackout. Reliable factual account; opinions come from named experts (government spokesman, RSF).  
- New Vision (April 13, 2024): Reports Prime Minister Maiga’s condition that elections await “complete” security stabilization. Single named source (Maiga via AFP). Factual, but narrow.  
- BBC (Aug 30, 2023): Contextual data on African coups overall. Authoritative; no direct evidence about Mali’s party dissolutions.  
- Perplexity report: AI-generated synthesis of dissolution/reinstatement cycles in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso. Useful for constructing a reference class but must be treated cautiously—some cited sources may not exist.

2. Reference-class analysis  
Potential classes:  
a. Military regimes dissolving political parties in West Africa since 2020 and subsequent reversals.  
b. Major repressive decrees by the Malian junta and their speed of rollback.  
c. Suspensions or dissolutions of civic organizations in Mali and how long before any partial lifting.  

Findings:  
– Class (a): Mali (Apr 2024) suspended party activities; partial lifting in July 2024 (~90 days). Niger (2025) and Burkina (2022) have not reversed dissolutions to date. No instance of a full or general reversal within 40 days.  
– Class (b)/(c): Media blackout April 2024 reversed in ~90 days. No case of “backtrack” within 30–45 days.  

Conclusion: The most suitable reference class is “dissolution or suspension of political-party activity by West African military juntas and the time to any reversal.” Historical reversals take ~90 days, and most never reverse.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: May 22 to July 1, 2025 (~40 days). Historical pattern: partial rollbacks of political-life restrictions in Mali/Burkina/Niger have occurred, if at all, on multi-month horizons (typically 2–4 months), not within 1–1.5 months.

4. Justification  
- The May 13 decree follows a junta-controlled consultation that overwhelmingly backed dissolution and Gen. Goïta’s prolonged term. There is no signal from the leadership of any impending backtracking.  
- Domestic opposition is fragmented, lacking the leverage to force a U-turn in under six weeks.  
- International actors (UN, ECOWAS disarray, Western counter-terror partners) have condemned the move but stopped short of sanctions or credible threats that might prompt a rapid reversal.  
- Under previous regime actions, even a partial reinstatement took ~3 months. A full reversal—reopening general party formation—would require drafting and passing a new political-party law, plus implementation. That process alone would exceed 40 days.  
- Regional peers (Niger, Burkina) show no inclination to reverse similar measures swiftly, reinforcing a low-probability baseline.

Outside view calibration:  
Reference-class frequency of reversal within 40 days: essentially zero in 4 comparable cases (Mali 2024; Niger 2025; Burkina 2022; Mali parties in 2020s), suggesting a probability under 10%. Given the regime’s entrenchment, weak opposition leverage, and absence of credible external pressure for an immediate change, I assign roughly a 7% chance of reversal before July 1, 2025.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 7% probability that Mali’s government will reverse its May 13, 2025 decree dissolving all political parties by July 1, 2025.

Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. Britannica (May 21, 2025) – High‐quality tertiary source. Provides deep historical background on Mali’s party politics and past coups. Its content is factual, neutral, and well referenced. No direct opinions bearing on the current decree reversal.  
   b. TRT Global (mid‐May 2025) – Regional news outlet with moderate reliability. Reports the May 13 decree, context of the national assembly, and junta justifications. Factual elements (dates, quotes from Diepkile and Konaté) are credible; unnamed opposition quotes are opinion.  
   c. RFI (May 14, 2025) – Reputable international broadcaster. Covers the decree, protests, disappearances, and junta rationale. Facts are backed by Reuters and Human Rights Watch; opposition comments clearly labeled as opinion.  
   d. France 24 (April 2024) – Reliable. Documents the April 2024 suspension of party activities and media clampdown. Distinguishes between government statements and civil‐society reactions.  
   e. New Vision (April 2024) – Regional paper. Reports PM Maiga’s conditions for elections. Factual but limited scope.  
   f. BBC (August 2023) – Top‐tier. Provides long‐term coup context in Africa. No specific references to party dissolutions in Mali post‐2023 but informs the regional coup wave.  
   g. Perplexity report – Aggregates multiple secondary sources across Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso. Quality varies by citation; some sources are high‐quality (Human Rights Watch, ISS), others less so. Opinions from expert bodies are flagged; undated or unnamed claims are lower reliability.

2. Reference class analysis  
   Possible classes:  
   • “Militaries dissolve party systems and then reverse within X months” – Mali April–July 2024 (partial reversal in ~3 months); no similar rapid reversals in Niger (2025) or Burkina Faso (2022–24). Suitability: moderate but small-N.  
   • “Junta policy reversals under domestic/international pressure” – April 2024 saw partial backtracking amid ECOWAS/UN censure. Today (2025), international leverage is weaker (ECOWAS neutrality, withdrawal of French/UN forces). Suitability: strong for policy‐reversal impetus but political context has hardened.  
   • “Authoritarian decrees in Mali’s transition periods” – 2020–25 cycle of delays, suspensions, dissolutions, and limited reversals. Only one significant reversal (July 2024) and it was partial. Suitability: high for predicting rate of full reversal.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Forecast window: ~40 days (May 22–July 1, 2025).  
   – Historical benchmarks:  
      • April 2024 suspension → July 2024 partial lift: ~3 months.  
      • Full dissolution in May 2025 → no historical precedent for reversal that quickly.  
   – Reversals of sweeping dissolutions typically take ≥3 months if they occur at all; within ~6 weeks is unprecedented in this context.

4. Justification for outside view  
   – The May 13, 2025 decree is a stronger, more irreversible measure than the April 2024 suspension. It follows a national assembly that legitimized Goïta’s extended term and was implemented via presidential broadcast.  
   – Past partial reversals occurred under intense regional/international mediation (ECOWAS threats, UN pressure); today those levers are largely absent or neutralized.  
   – Oppositional capacity is weakened (arrests, abductions, media bans), protests small relative to regime strength.  
   – Regional peers (Niger, Burkina Faso) are consolidating similar measures, creating a “Sahel junta bloc” that discourages unilateral policy retreats.  
   – Given the short lead time and lack of fresh, binding external pressure or an internal breakdown, the probability of reversal is low.

Outside view calibration:  
   – Reference‐class anchoring: 1 partial reversal in 1 major suspension/dissolution event over the past year (100% reversal rate for suspension but 0% for full dissolution in 2025).  
   – Time‐window adjustment: reversal time typically ≥3 months; our window is <2 months.  
   – Context adjustment: external pressure weaker now vs. April 2024; opposition more repressed.  
   – Rough tether: April 2024 event implies ~30% chance of any policy rollback; full dissolutions historically have ~0%. Blend to ~10% to allow a small chance of regime tactical softening (e.g., limited reinstatement to defuse protests).

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 10% chance that, before July 1, 2025, the government of Mali will reverse its May 13, 2025 decree dissolving all political parties.

• New Vision (13 Apr 2024).  Ugandan daily citing AFP interview of Mali’s PM.  Provides single factual quote on elections being deferred until “security stabilises.”  Reliability: medium.  
• BBC feature (30 Aug 2023).  Aggregated data set of African coups; high reliability for statistics, but descriptive rather than predictive.  
• Perplexity “Military Dissolution and Reinstatement” report (2025).  AI-generated secondary synthesis drawing on unnamed web pieces; contains many accurate-looking facts but also some unsourced assertions (e.g., “July 2024 lifting” of Mali suspension that is not corroborated by RFI or TRT).  Treat factual claims with caution; use mainly for its reference-class enumeration, not specific details.  

(b)  Reference-class analysis  

Potential classes for a base-rate:  
1 .  Post-1960 military regimes worldwide that **formally banned or dissolved political parties** and then **rescinded the ban** within one year.  
2 .  Same as (1) but rescinded within 60 days.  
3 .  African Sahel coups (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Sudan) that imposed broad political bans and later lifted them.  
4 .  Generic authoritarian policy reversals (any region) inside 60 days.  

Data availability: the scholarly literature (e.g., Geddes, Wright & Frantz dictatorships data set; Powell & Thyne coup lists) documents about 90 military regimes since 1946.  Rough hand-count from secondary literature suggests ~35 imposed outright party bans; of those, only a handful (Ghana 1966 ban partially relaxed in 1969; Nigeria 1978 ban lifted after 30 months; Sudan 2019 partial restoration after 3 months) were rescinded quickly, and virtually none inside 60 days absent regime change.  

Suitability: Class 2 is the tightest match to our question (ban rescinded inside 50-day window).  Empirically it is vanishingly rare, provides a clear baseline, and avoids extra subjective assumptions.  We adopt class 2 as principal reference-class.  

Rough base-rate computation:  
– Estimated N of outright bans since 1946: ~35  
– Cases where reversal occurred ≤60 days: at most 1 (possible Sudan 2019 transitional council, but even that was >70 days).  
Base-rate ≤3%.  Conservatively round to 4% ±2 pp to reflect data ambiguity.  

(c)  Timeframe analysis  

Days until 1 July 2025: 40.  Historical patterns show that when bans are lifted it is normally tied to (i) major external shock (coup reversal, foreign intervention, peace agreement) or (ii) scheduled transition timeline negotiated months in advance.  Forty days is too short for such structural changes.  Thus the conditional probability of reversal given that it has not yet happened by May 22 remains extremely low and tends to decrease with time elapsed since decree (the “decay” pattern of policy-change hazard functions).  

(d)  Justification  

• Intention durability: Military decrees dissolving parties are usually designed to consolidate power and last until the junta feels secure; mean durations are measured in years, not weeks.  
• Absent leverage:  ECOWAS sanctions threat is muted because Mali quit the bloc; UN and Western condemnations have had little effect on previous restrictions (media bans, MINUSMA withdrawal).  
• No precedent of rapid U-turns by Goïta’s junta on core political questions (election timing, media freedom, foreign troop presence).  
• Historical base-rate (≤3-4%) aligns with theoretical expectation that such reversals require either (a) a new coup faction toppling the current rulers or (b) overwhelming external pressure—neither visible today.  
• Therefore, before looking at any “inside” specifics, the outside-view probability of a reversal inside the next 40 days is very low, a single-digit percentage.  

Outside view calibration:

Starting from the empirical base-rate of ≈3%.  
Adjust +1 pp to allow for small sample size and uncertainty (the decree is only a by-law; in theory junta could simply issue a clarifying communiqué to placate international donors).  
Adjust 0 pp for expert/market expectations (no prediction markets exist, but analysts’ commentary uniformly pessimistic).  

Calibrated outside-view probability = 4 %.  Expressed as odds: about 1 in 25.

Outside View Prediction:
4 % (±1 pp)

Analysis:
1. Paraphrase  
By July 1, 2025 (≈39 days away), will Mali’s military-led government formally revoke its May 13 decree dissolving all political parties and re-open party formation?

2. Source analysis  
• TRT Global (May 21): UN special rapporteurs condemn the decree. Reliable, identifiable experts. Factual reporting of UN statement.  
• ISS Africa (May 20): Independent think-tank outlines domestic protests, boycott of national consultations, and possible AU facilitation. Well-sourced analytical piece.  
• Reuters via US News (May 13): Confirms formal dissolution and protests, arrests by “masked gendarmes.” Authoritative wire service.  
• BBC (May 22): International concern over move, diaspora reaction. Reputable broadcaster.  
• UN High Commissioner statements (May 16): Volker Türk demands repeal, warns of rights violations. Credible institutional source.  
Opinions are clearly labeled and mostly from UN experts or think-tank analysts; other commentary (e.g., The Militant) is ideologically driven and down-weighted.

3. Outside view base rate  
Military juntas in Mali/Niger/Burkina suspending party politics almost never backtrack within 1–2 months. Historical analogs suggest <10% reversal chance in short timeframe.

4. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence for no reversal (large downward shift):  
• Structural/institutional: Goïta’s junta follows Niger/Burkina model—banned parties, extended term. Hard to reverse internally.  
• Historical pattern: 2022 commitment to elections postponed indefinitely; 2025 dissolution likewise upheld.  
• Causal mechanism: Consolidation of power, removal of competitive forces.  
Moderate evidence for potential reversal (small upward shift):  
• International pressure: UN experts, AU obligations, ECOWAS exile offers—but Mali has left ECOWAS and pivoted to Russia, limiting leverage.  
• Domestic protests: unprecedented but small scale and suppressed; unlikely to force policy U-turn within weeks.  

5. Timeframe analysis  
With only ~5–6 weeks left, meaningful policy reversal would require rapid regime recalibration or major external sanction/threat—neither evident. If timeframe halved, chance falls toward zero; if doubled to ~3 months, marginally higher (perhaps ~10–15%) if sustained mediation emerges.

6. Justification and adjustment  
Starting from a ~10% base rate (short-term reversals in similar contexts), the strong evidence of regime entrenchment and lack of credible external coercion warrants reducing probability. Moderate UN/AU pressure and ongoing protests provide a sliver of chance but insufficient to offset. Net: ~7% probability.

Blind-spot  
An internal coup or split within the junta could lead to rapid policy reversal, but there are no visible signs of factionalism at present.

Status quo lean  
Most likely outcome is continuation of the ban; reversal would be a significant deviation requiring major political shock.

Probability calibration  
Given the short window, entrenched military control, and limited leverage on Mali’s regime, I assign a low probability of policy reversal by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrased question and criteria (≤30 words) – OK  
2. Outside view base rate (~<10%) – OK  
3. Consistency: “7 times out of 100, Mali reverses decree within 39 days” – plausible  
4. Top evidence (4–5 items): regime entrenchment; pattern of postponements; lack of leverage; small protests; UN pressure – all assessed  
5. Blind-spot: internal junta split – noted  
6. Status quo: ban likely persists – considered

Probability: 7%
Predicted Probability: 7.0%

Analysis:
1. Question restatement  
   Before July 1, 2025, will Mali’s government announce a reversal of its May 13 decree dissolving all political parties (including allowing new parties)?

2. Source analysis  
   • Reuters/US News (May 13): High-reliability. Reports formal dissolution, junta rationale, no mention of plans to reverse.  
   • ISS Africa (May 21): Moderate reliability. Documents unprecedented party resistance and warns heavy-handed tactics may backfire.  
   • TRT Global (May 14): Moderate. Covers UN experts’ condemnations and demands repeal, plus opposition protests.  
   • PremiumTimesNG (May 20): Moderate. Analysis urging dialogue, notes AU could facilitate mediation.  
   • UN High Commissioner statements (May 16): High. Calls for repeal, but no enforcement mechanism cited.  
   • ECOWAS statements: Low–moderate. No active sanctions or credible threats of force to compel reversal.

3. Evidence analysis  
   Strong (large shifts):  
   • Regional junta synergy—Mali, Niger, Burkina all suspend parties; no one has reversed such decrees (structural precedent).  
   • Entrenchment of Assimi Goïta’s rule—national assembly legitimation and five-year term reduce incentives to backtrack.  
   Moderate (moderate shifts):  
   • Opposition protests and public defiance—unprecedented but small scale; could force limited concessions.  
   • UN/AU calls for repeal—signal of international concern but lack binding leverage.  
   Weak (small shifts):  
   • Historic April 2024 partial rollback after ECOWAS/UN pressure—less analogous because that was a suspension, not a full dissolution.  
   • Speculation of intra-junta divisions—no concrete evidence.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   • Forecast window: ~40 days.  
   • Historical rollback of similar measures took ≥3 months; our window is <2 months—unfavorable for reversal.  
   • If window halved (~20 days), chance falls ~50%; if doubled (~80 days), chance roughly doubles but still low (<20%).

5. Justification & inside-view adjustment  
   – Outside view base rate: 10% chance of reversal.  
   – Structural entrenchment and regional precedent pull probability down (–4%).  
   – Opposition protests, UN/AU pressure, and potential AU mediation pull probability up (+1%).  
   – Net inside-view probability ≈7%.

Probability calibration  
I forecast that in 7 out of 100 cases the junta reverses the decree before July 1 2025 given current pressures and structural disincentives.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will Mali reverse its May 13, 2025 decree dissolving all parties by July 1, 2025?” (Yes/No)  
2. Outside view base rate: 10% from similar events.  
3. Consistency: “7 out of 100 times, the decree is reversed.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   a. Regional precedent of no reversals (strong).  
   b. Goïta’s power consolidation (strong).  
   c. Opposition protests (moderate).  
   d. UN/AU calls (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden coup against Goïta or major security shock forcing a political reset—would raise reversal odds dramatically.  
6. Status quo bias: Parties remain dissolved absent a strong enabling shock.

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• ISS Africa, 20 May 2025 – Well-regarded think-tank; factual chronology of decree and opposition protests, analytical but evidence-based. Little partisan bias.  
• Reuters/US News, 13 May 2025 – International wire, high factual reliability; gives decree details and arrests.  
• TRT Global, 14 May 2025 – Mid-tier broadcaster; facts align with Reuters, adds quotes from UN experts (identifiable).  
• BBC Afrique, 22 May 2025 – Major public broadcaster; recaps decree and international criticism.  
• France 24, 13 May 2025 – Global news channel; confirms decree text and ban on meetings.  
• UN OHCHR press release, 16 May 2025 (cited by several outlets) – Authoritative on human-rights condemnation.  
No article since 13 May reports any hint from the junta of rescinding the decree; all coverage shows consolidation, not back-tracking. Dates are within the last nine days, so information is fresh.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
1. Historical record: <5 % of military regimes that formally ban parties rescind within two months (Geddes et al.; Sudan 2019 closest but >70 days).  
2. Structural alignment: Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger juntas now form AES bloc and have each imposed or prolonged party bans; mutual reinforcement lowers reversal odds.  
3. Institutions: Mali exited ECOWAS and already absorbed prior international sanctions; external leverage is weak.

Moderate evidence  
4. Domestic protests: Hundreds rallied 3–4 May and 22 May despite repression (Reuters, Militant). Demonstrates opposition capacity but still small scale.  
5. Fiscal stress/power-outage discontent (ISS Africa) could pressure regime, yet conversion to policy change in 40 days is uncertain.

Weak evidence  
6. UN/AU statements demanding repeal – moral weight but historically low coercive power absent sanctions.  
7. Speculation that junta may issue “clarifying” communiqués to regain aid – no sourcing.

Net directional pull: factors 1–3 (strong) anchor very low probability; 4–7 provide only slight upward tug.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining to resolution: 40 days. Median duration of comparable bans is measured in years; hazard rate of reversal declines after first week unless triggered by coup or large foreign pressure. Halving the window to 20 days would shave ~1 pp off probability; doubling to 80 days would raise it only modestly (+2–3 pp) because structural drivers still dominate.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start with outside-view 4 %.  
DOWN −1 pp: No example of Goïta reversing any major political restriction since 2020 (media bans, election delays, MINUSMA expulsion).  
DOWN −0.5 pp: Alignment with AES partners makes climb-down more reputationally costly.  
UP +0.5 pp: Unusually quick and coordinated UN condemnation might cue AU facilitation; small chance junta offers cosmetic reversal to unlock donor funds.  
Net inside-view = 3 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 3 out of 100 times a Malian junta that has just dissolved parties would fully reverse itself within the next 40 days.

Checklist:  
1. Question restated – “By 1 Jul 2025 will Mali’s government publicly repeal the 13 May decree that dissolved all parties?”  
2. Base rate used: ≈4 % (party-ban reversals ≤60 days).  
3. Consistency: “3/100 times decree is repealed before 1 Jul.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) historical rarity of quick reversals; (ii) AES bloc consolidation; (iii) weak external leverage post-ECOWAS exit; (iv) modest domestic protests; (v) fiscal stress.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden internal coup removing Goïta and new junta seeks legitimacy by reinstating parties—would flip probability upward.  
6. Status-quo bias: Junta has doubled-down on authoritarian track since 2023; inertia favours “No”.
