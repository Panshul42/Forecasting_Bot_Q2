Analysis:
To ground an outside‐view baseline for FY2028 net outlays, the first step is to examine the historical FRED series of federal net outlays (nominal USD, fiscal‐year basis), tracing its growth rate and volatility from, say, FY2000 through FY2024. Over that period outlays rose from roughly \$2 trillion to \$6.75 trillion, implying a nominal CAGR around 5–6%, driven largely by Social Security, healthcare, and rising net interest costs. Next, CBO’s 10‑year budget outlook will provide its FY2025–FY2028 projections, reflecting demographic trends, economic assumptions, and current policy. Comparing FRED’s actuals and CBO forecasts establishes our baseline out‐of‐sample projection for FY2028. We can then adjust this baseline for potential policy effects—e.g., savings from DOGE’s efficiency measures (currently negligible at \$130 billion to date) and likely reconciliation‐driven spending caps or tax changes under unified Republican control. Key historical context needed: the nominal trajectory of net outlays, CBO’s recent projections, and the relative size of major spending categories driving aggregate growth.

<Summary source="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/monthly-treasury-statement/">
The article presents a single comprehensive table, “Federal Budget Receipts and Outlays,” covering every U.S. fiscal year from 1930 through estimates for 2026.  For each year it shows:

• Nominal federal receipts, outlays, and the resulting surplus or deficit (all in billions of dollars)  
• U.S. GDP (also in billions)  
• Receipts, outlays and surplus/deficit expressed as percentages of GDP  

Key patterns and milestones:  
• Receipts grew from $4.1 billion in FY 1930 to an estimated $5,332.1 billion in FY 2026.  
• Outlays rose from $3.3 billion in 1930 to an estimated $6,746.3 billion in 2026.  
• Deficits dominate the record:  
  – Peaked in WWII years (e.g. FY 1943: –$54.6 b, or –29.6% of GDP)  
  – Spiked during the 2009 financial crisis (FY 2009: –$1,412.7 b, –9.8% GDP)  
  – Reached their largest nominal and relative levels in the COVID era (FY 2020: –$3,129.2 b, –14.9% GDP; FY 2021 estimate: –$3,668.7 b, –16.7% GDP)  
• Brief surpluses occurred in FY 1947–49 and FY 1998–2001 (e.g. FY 2000: +$236.2 b, 2.3% of GDP).  
• Receipts as a share of GDP have generally ranged between about 14½% (low in 2010) and roughly 20% (peaks around 2000–01 and in mid‑2020s estimates).  
• Outlays climbed from roughly 3.3% of GDP in 1930 to around 24–25% by the mid‑2020s estimates.  

Overall, the table illustrates long‑term growth in federal revenues and spending, the fiscal impact of wars and economic crises, intermittent surplus years in the late 1940s and late 1990s, and the large modern deficits of the 21st century.

Below is a concise summary of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s June 18, 2024 press release on the CBO’s June 2024 baseline update:

1. Debt‑and‑Deficit Projections  
   • Debt held by the public rises from 97.3 % of GDP at end‑2023 to  
     – 106.2 % by end‑FY 2027 (a new post‑WWII record)  
     – 122.4 % by end‑FY 2034  
   • Dollar terms: debt grows by ~$23 trillion over 2024–2034 (from >\$27 trillion today to nearly \$51 trillion by 2034)  
   • Annual budget deficits:  
     – \$1.9 trillion (6.7 % of GDP) in FY 2024  
     – \$1.8 trillion (5.5 % of GDP) in FY 2027  
     – \$2.9 trillion (6.9 % of GDP) in FY 2034  
     – Total deficits of \$22.1 trillion (6.3 % of GDP) over FY 2025–2034—\$2.1 trillion more than in the February baseline  

2. Spending vs. Revenue (2025–2034)  
   • Total spending: \$84.9 trillion (24.1 % of GDP)  
   • Total revenue: \$62.8 trillion (17.8 % of GDP)  
   • By FY 2034:  
     – Spending: \$10.3 trillion (24.9 % of GDP)  
     – Revenue: \$7.5 trillion (18.0 % of GDP)  
   • 50‑year historic averages: spending 21.0 % of GDP, revenue 17.3 %

3. Interest Costs  
   • Projected to more than double from \$345 billion in FY 2020 to \$892 billion (3.1 % of GDP) in FY 2024, exceeding defense and Medicare outlays  
   • Exceed their record share of GDP in FY 2025 and top \$1 trillion that year  
   • Reach \$1.7 trillion (4.1 % of GDP) by FY 2034  

4. Changes Since February Baseline  
   • FY 2034 debt is \$2.4 trillion (6.4 % of GDP) higher than previously projected  
   • Of the \$2.5 trillion increase in projected deficits over 2024–2034:  
     – \$1.6 trillion stems from legislative changes  
     – \$1.5 trillion from technical factors (including executive actions)  
     – Partially offset by \$638 billion of deficit reduction from updated economic projections  
   • The \$408 billion upward revision to the FY 2024 deficit largely reflects proposed student‑debt cancellation outlays and other technical adjustments  

5. Trust‑Fund Insolvency Projections  
   • Highway Trust Fund insolvency projected in FY 2028  
   • Social Security Old‑Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund insolvency projected in 2033  
   • Upon insolvency, benefits would be cut across the board to match incoming revenues

</Summary>

<Summary source="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-releases-june-2024-baseline-update">
Below is a summary of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s write‑up of the Congressional Budget Office’s February 2024 Budget and Economic Outlook. All data and projections come from CBO unless otherwise noted.

1. Debt Projections  
   • Debt held by the public rises from \$27 trillion today to \$48 trillion by end of FY 2034 (+\$21 trillion).  
   • As a share of GDP, debt grows from 97 percent in FY 2023 (vs. 50‑year average of 48 percent) to:  
     – 106 percent by FY 2028 (a new record)  
     – 116 percent by FY 2034  
   • Alternative “extended policy” scenario (e.g. extend expiring tax cuts, discretionary growth with GDP): debt could hit 131 percent of GDP by FY 2034.

2. Deficit Projections  
   Baseline (assuming expirations as scheduled):  
   • Total deficits of \$20.0 trillion over FY 2025–2034 (5.7 percent of GDP)  
   • Yearly deficits:  
     – FY 2022: \$1.4 trillion  
     – FY 2023: \$1.7 trillion  
     – FY 2024: \$1.5 trillion  
     – FY 2025: \$1.8 trillion  
     – FY 2031: >\$2.0 trillion  
     – FY 2034: \$2.6 trillion  
   • Deficit as % of GDP falls from 6.3 percent in FY 2023 to 5.3 percent in FY 2024, then back up to 6.2 percent by FY 2034 (a level ~70 percent above the 50‑year average of 3.7 percent).  
   Alternative “extended policy” scenario:  
   • Total deficits of \$26 trillion over next decade (7.4 percent of GDP)  
   • FY 2034 deficit ~\$3.5 trillion (8.5 percent of GDP)

3. Spending vs. Revenue over FY 2025–2034  
   • Spending: \$82.7 trillion (23.5 percent of GDP)  
   • Revenue: \$62.6 trillion (17.8 percent of GDP)  
   – Implies revenue covers ~75 percent of outlays (spending exceeds revenue by ~33 percent).  
   Historical averages (50 years): spending 21.0 percent of GDP; revenue 17.3 percent.

4. Drivers of Rising Spending  
   • Social Security & health care outlays nearly double between FY 2023 and 2034:  
     – Social Security: \$2.9 trillion → \$5.3 trillion (10.8 → 12.7 percent of GDP)  
   • Interest costs:  
     – \$659 billion in 2023; projected to double by 2031 and reach \$1.6 trillion (3.9 percent of GDP) by 2034  
     – Will exceed defense and Medicare spending within the decade.  
   • Trust fund solvency:  
     – Highway Trust Fund insolvent in FY 2028 ⇒ automatic ~50 percent cut in surface‑transport spending  
     – Social Security OASI insolvent by 2033 ⇒ immediate ~25 percent benefit cut unless law changes  
     – Medicare HI (Part A) likely insolvent by 2035; baseline assumes programs continue spending past insolvency, leading to combined cash deficits of \$4.4 trillion through 2034 (1.2 percent of GDP).

5. Impact of Recent Legislation & Technical Changes  
   • Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) caps: reduced projected deficits by \$2.6 trillion through FY 2033 (including extrapolated discretionary and emergency spending cuts).  
   • Technical/assumption changes (e.g. student‑debt regulations, IRA credits) add \$1.1 trillion to deficits.

Key takeaway: Under CBO’s updated baseline, the federal government faces rapidly rising debt, deficits, and interest costs over the coming decade—driven by growth in mandatory health and retirement spending and record interest outlays—requiring significant policy changes to avert historically large imbalances.

Query: List historical annual U.S. federal net outlays FY2000–FY2024 and CBO nominal projections FY2025–FY2028, explaining key drivers behind the trend
# Historical and Projected U.S. Federal Net Outlays: FY2000–FY2028  

Federal net outlays—the total expenditures minus offsetting receipts—have undergone substantial growth over the past quarter-century, driven by structural increases in mandatory programs, demographic shifts, and fiscal policy decisions. This report analyzes historical net outlays from FY2000 to FY2024 and the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) nominal projections for FY2025–FY2028, identifying key drivers behind these trends.  

---

## Historical Net Outlays (FY2000–FY2024)  

### FY2000–FY2009: Moderate Growth and Fiscal Shocks  
In FY2000, net outlays totaled **$1.79 trillion** (17.6% of GDP), reflecting a budget surplus driven by strong economic growth and constrained discretionary spending post-Cold War[1][15]. By FY2009, outlays surged to **$3.52 trillion** (24.4% of GDP) due to the Global Financial Crisis, which precipitated emergency measures like the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)[16][17].  

### FY2010–FY2019: Post-Crisis Stabilization and Entitlement Expansion  
Net outlays grew at an annualized rate of 3.4% during this period, reaching **$4.45 trillion** (20.3% of GDP) by FY2019[16]. Key drivers included:  
- **Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation**: Expanded Medicaid eligibility and healthcare subsidies added $1.1 trillion in cumulative outlays[17].  
- **Defense spending**: Base budgets rose from $526 billion (FY2010) to $686 billion (FY2019) due to prolonged engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq[12][17].  
- **Aging population**: Social Security and Medicare outlays increased by 42% and 62%, respectively, from FY2010 to FY2019[16].  

### FY2020–FY2024: Pandemic Response and Inflationary Pressures  
The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented fiscal interventions:  
- **FY2020**: Outlays spiked to **$6.55 trillion** (31.3% of GDP) with programs like the CARES Act ($2.2 trillion)[3][17].  
- **FY2024**: Outlays reached **$6.8 trillion** (23.4% of GDP), moderated by post-pandemic contraction but elevated by interest costs and student debt relief[3][6]. Notably, net interest payments doubled from $325 billion (FY2020) to $663 billion (FY2024) due to Federal Reserve rate hikes[6][16].  

---

## CBO Projections (FY2025–FY2028)  

### Baseline Trajectory  
The CBO projects nominal net outlays to rise steadily:  
- **FY2025**: $7.0 trillion (23.3% of GDP)[2][4]  
- **FY2026**: $7.3 trillion (23.6% of GDP)[4]  
- **FY2028**: $7.9 trillion (24.4% of GDP)[2][4]  

### Structural Drivers  
1. **Mandatory Programs**:  
   - Social Security outlays will grow from $1.2 trillion (FY2024) to $1.6 trillion (FY2028) as Baby Boomers retire[2][16].  
   - Medicare spending will increase by 5.3% annually due to healthcare inflation and utilization[4][17].  

2. **Interest Costs**:  
   Net interest will surpass defense spending by FY2027, reaching $1.1 trillion (3.4% of GDP) in FY2028 as debt servicing compounds[2][16].  

3. **Discretionary Pressures**:  
   - Defense budgets are projected to grow 2–3% annually amid strategic competition with China and Russia[11][12].  
   - Nondefense discretionary spending faces constraints, with FY2028 levels still 4% below FY2010 inflation-adjusted totals[16].  

4. **Legislative Changes**:  
   - The 2025 repeal of Social Security’s windfall elimination provision added $0.2 trillion to outlays over a decade[2].  
   - The American Relief Act (2025) temporarily reduced IRS funding, lowering revenue collections by $20 billion[6].  

---

## Key Trend Analysis  

### Acceleration of Debt Service Costs  
Interest payments have shifted from 1.9% of GDP (FY2022) to a projected 3.4% by FY2028, reflecting both higher rates (5.2% on 10-year Treasuries in 2025) and debt accumulation (118% of GDP by 2035)[4][16]. This creates a feedback loop: higher deficits necessitate more borrowing, further increasing interest burdens[2][4].  

### Entitlement Program Unsustainability  
Mandatory spending (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid) consumed 62% of FY2024 outlays, up from 53% in FY2000[1][17]. Without reform, these programs will drive 78% of outlay growth through FY2035[2][16].  

### Fiscal Transparency Gaps  
Offsetting collections (e.g., Medicare premiums, lease revenues) masked 12% of gross outlays annually since 2000, obscuring true expenditure levels[1]. The CBO’s adjusted baseline—excluding timing shifts—shows deficits rising to 6.1% of GDP by 2035[4].  

---

## Conclusion  

U.S. federal net outlays have transitioned from surplus-driven restraint in FY2000 to structural deficits exceeding 5% of GDP. While pandemic spending temporarily distorted trends, the core drivers—entitlements, interest costs, and defense needs—reflect systemic fiscal challenges. The CBO’s projections underscore the urgency of reforms to mandatory programs and deficit reduction strategies to avert long-term economic risks.

[Current LLM Output]
Analysis:
The key to forecasting FY2028 net outlays is establishing a solid base‐rate from the CBO’s multi‐year baseline, then adjusting for policy actions (DOGE’s savings claims, 2025 reconciliation cuts/tax changes) and macro drivers (rising interest costs, entitlement growth, GDP). We need: (1) the latest CBO baseline projection for FY2028 outlays; (2) updates on 2025 budget reconciliation negotiations (likely spending caps or revenue changes); and (3) recent statements or progress reports from DOGE on actual savings and targets through 2026.

<Summary source="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61270">
Below are the key takeaways from the Peterson Foundation’s summary of the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) May 2024 report on the federal fiscal outlook:

1. Debt‑to‑GDP  
   • FY 2023: debt held by the public = 97 percent of GDP  
   • By 2027: debt > 106.1 percent (all‑time high, post‑WWII)  
   • By 2034: debt projected at 122 percent of GDP  

2. Annual Deficits  
   • 2024: \$1.9 trillion (6.7 percent of GDP)  
   • 2027: deficit falls to 5.5 percent of GDP  
   • 2034: \$2.9 trillion (6.9 percent of GDP)  

3. Interest Rates  
   • 3‑month Treasury bills: 5.2 percent in CY 2024; projected 2.8 percent in 2028, then stable  
   • 10‑year Treasury: 4.5 percent in CY 2024; projected fall to 3.6 percent in 2027, then rise to 4.1 percent by 2032  

4. Net Interest Costs  
   • 2021: \$352 billion  
   • 2024: \$892 billion  
   • 2034: \$1.7 trillion  
   • Net interest as share of GDP will exceed its 1991 peak (3.2 percent) as soon as 2025  

5. Mandatory Program Spending  
   • Major health programs (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, premium tax credits): 5.6 percent of GDP in 2024 → 6.8 percent in 2034  
   • Social Security: 5.1 percent of GDP in 2024 → 6.0 percent in 2034  

6. Trust‑Fund Solvency  
   • Social Security OASI Trust Fund: projected depletion in 2033  
   • Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund: depletion shortly after the 10‑year window  
   • Highway Trust Fund: depletion in 2028  
   – Once depleted, these programs cannot pay full scheduled benefits without changes  

7. Revenues vs. Outlays  
   • Revenues: 17.2 percent of GDP in 2024 → dip to 17.0 percent in 2025 → roughly 18 percent from 2026–2034  
   • CBO assumes 2017 individual tax provisions expire end‑2025; extending them without offsets would worsen deficits  

8. Worsening Outlook vs. February 2024  
   • 2025–2034 cumulative deficits now projected at \$22.1 trillion (10 percent higher than the \$20 trillion projected four months earlier)  
   • Main drivers: supplemental appropriations (e.g., aid to Ukraine/Israel), technical revisions lowering corporate‐tax receipts and raising healthcare‑program spending  
   • Partially offset by upward revisions to projected revenues from economic changes  

Bottom line: CBO projects a growing structural mismatch between spending and revenues, rising debt and interest costs, and impending trust‐fund insolvencies, painting an increasingly unsustainable fiscal trajectory.

<Summary source="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-12/60884-NIPA.pdf">
Below is a concise summary of key data, projections, and findings from Bipartisan Policy Center’s “Visualizing CBO’s Budget and Economic Outlook: 2025.” All figures and forecasts are drawn from the Congressional Budget Office’s January 2025 baseline.

1. Overall Fiscal Outlook  
   • Debt held by the public:  
     – End of FY 2024: \$30.1 trillion (100% of GDP)  
     – Projected end of FY 2035: \$52.1 trillion (118% of GDP), the highest share ever and surpassing WWII levels before decade’s end  
   • Spending vs. revenues (FY 2026–2035 average):  
     – Federal spending: ~24% of GDP  
     – Federal revenues: ~18% of GDP  
     – Implies every dollar of discretionary spending is borrowed in 2025  

2. Deficits  
   • FY 2025 deficit: \$1.9 trillion (6.2% of GDP), up slightly from \$1.8 trillion in FY 2024 (6.4% of GDP)  
   • FY 2026–2035 annual deficits: rise to \$2.5 trillion but remain ~6% of GDP  
   • Compared to CBO’s June 2024 outlook: cumulative deficits FY 2025–2034 are \$1 trillion lower  
     – Driven by \$2.5 trillion of stronger tax receipts (higher growth)  
     – Partially offset by \$1.3 trillion of technical baseline adjustments and \$271 billion from new legislation (e.g., Social Security Fairness Act)  

3. Spending Drivers  
   • Net interest payments:  
     – Will exceed \$1 trillion in FY 2026  
     – Grow 6.5% annually FY 2025–2035  
     – Already the second‑largest outlay after Social Security  
   • Mandatory programs (FY 2025–2035):  
     – Social Security and net Medicare account for ~50% of spending growth and 65% of non‑interest growth  
     – Social Security spending up due to repeal of Windfall Elimination and Government Pension Offset (Social Security Fairness Act, Dec 2024)  
     – Social Security Old‑Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund projected exhausted in FY 2033 (CBO baseline assumes full benefits continue absent reform)  
     – Medicare projections modestly reduced by slower enrollee growth and payment updates  
   • Discretionary spending:  
     – Defense and nondefense grow with inflation but decline as a share of GDP  
     – Changes in disaster relief and Fiscal Responsibility Act caps shift relative shares (higher nondefense, lower defense vs. prior baseline)  

4. Revenues  
   • FY 2025: \$5.2 trillion (17.1% of GDP)  
   • FY 2035: \$8.0 trillion (18.3% of GDP) under current‑law expiration of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions at end‑of‑2025  
   • Caveat: actual receipts hinge on if/which TCJA cuts are extended and what offsets Congress adopts  
   • Adjustments since June 2024:  
     – \$20 billion IRS funding rescission lowers receipts by \$66 billion over 10 years  
     – Higher GDP, taxable income, and technical tweaks raise projected revenues by \$812 billion  

5. Economic Projections

<Summary source="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/whats-in-the-fy2025-senate-budget-resolution/">
The Senate passed its amended FY 2025 budget resolution on April 5 (the House followed on April 10), formally unlocking the reconciliation process that lets major tax‑and‑spending bills clear the Senate with a simple majority. Key points of the FY 2025 Senate budget resolution:

1. Objectives  
   • Extend and expand expiring tax cuts, boost border security and defense spending, reform energy policy, and cut federal spending in select areas.  
   • Establish top‑line targets for revenues, spending, deficits, debt, and spending across 20 major functional categories (e.g., defense, health, transportation).

2. Reconciliation Instructions  
   • Senate topline: allows up to $2 trillion in additional deficits over 10 years.  
   • Because of overlapping committee instructions (notably on immigration) and a “current policy” baseline that assumes 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions continue indefinitely, the practical deficit ceiling rises to $5.7 trillion.  
   • For example, the Finance Committee is instructed to permit no more than a $1.5 trillion deficit increase—but under the baseline’s tacit $4 trillion cost of extending TCJA cuts, its true fiscal impact approaches $5.3 trillion.  
   • A parallel set of House instructions (Table 2 in the resolution) limit deficits to $3.3 trillion, though that figure could shift with legislative changes.

3. Budget Baseline  
   • Uses a “current policy” baseline that treats expiring tax‑cut provisions as permanent, thereby understating the real cost of extensions (over $4 trillion across 10 years).

4. Reserve Funds  
   • Standard reconciliation “unlock” reserve fund.  
   • Deficit‑neutral reserve fund for deregulation.  
   • Reserve fund supporting $2 trillion in mandatory spending cuts.  
   • Reserve fund endorsing the current policy baseline.  
   These funds are largely policy statements, subject to amendment (e.g., in a “vote‑a‑rama”), and give committee chairs flexibility to revise targets.

5. Enforcement (Title IV)  
   • Standard budget resolution enforcement provisions to bind reconciliation.  
   • Amended language making the $2 trillion mandatory‑cuts goal enforceable by adjusting the Ways and Means Committee’s instruction downward if other committees under‑deliver (or upward if they exceed cuts).  
   • Includes policy statements endorsing economic growth, further mandatory spending reductions, and government deregulation.

</Summary>

<Summary source="https://www.cbiz.com/insights/article/house-approves-fy-2025-budget-resolution-reconciliation-unlocked-for-tax-and-spending-legislation">
Here are the key points from the CBIZ article “House Approves FY 2025 Budget Resolution: Reconciliation Unlocked for Tax and Spending Legislation” (April 11, 2025):

Facts & Statistics  
1. On April 10, 2025, the House approved the FY 2025 budget resolution (as amended by the Senate on April 5) by a party‑line vote of 216–214.  
2. Approval of this joint budget framework “unlocks” the budget reconciliation process, permitting the GOP‑controlled Senate to pass spending, tax, and debt‑limit bills by simple majority (i.e., bypassing the 60‑vote filibuster threshold).  
3. Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) were made temporary to comply with reconciliation rules.  
4. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate: extending all TCJA provisions would increase the federal deficit by $6 trillion over 10 years.  
5. Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate: the 10‑year cost of extending TCJA is $4.6 trillion.  
6. The newly adopted FY 2025 resolution establishes a minimum floor of $4 billion in spending cuts; the House budget resolution passed in February had directed $1.5 trillion in cuts.  

Named Opinions & Positions  
• Republican leadership (House GOP) argues that “scoring” the extension of TCJA against the status quo (i.e., treating current temporary provisions as baseline) should yield zero additional deficit impact. Historically, scorekeeping assumes expiration then measures cost of reinstatement.  
• House Speaker Mike Johnson (R‑LA) publicly committed (Apr. 10) to include at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts in ensuing legislation.  
• Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R‑SD) promptly signaled alignment with the House’s target for budget savings.  

Process & Next Steps  
– Following a two‑week spring recess, relevant House and Senate committees (including tax writers) will draft bills consistent with the budget resolution’s instructions.  
– Both chambers must reconcile and approve identical legislation, with leadership aiming to send the final package to President Trump before Memorial Day.  

Less‑Formal/Background Notes  
– The article reminds readers that many TCJA provisions were intentionally sunset under existing rules to satisfy the 10‑year deficit constraint in reconciliation.  
– CBIZ states it will continue monitoring and reporting on legislative developments.

Here are the relevant news articles:

**Farage accused of peddling 'nonsense and lies' - as he predicts 'the new Brexit'**
Ed Miliband has accused Nigel Farage of spreading 'nonsense and lies' about the government's commitment to net zero, as Farage predicts the issue could become 'the new Brexit'. Farage also vowed to cut excess council spending if his party wins the local elections, comparing himself to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, the National Audit Office has warned councils are facing a major funding crisis, with social care putting huge strain on their budgets. Miliband warned that an anti-net zero agenda would risk 'climate breakdown' and 'forfeit the clean energy jobs of the future' in Britain.

**Donald Trump's proposed social security overhaul could spell trouble for retirees; here's why these changes may not be good news for older Americans**
President Trump's proposed tax breaks, including eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, overtime, and tips, could drain the program's funding sooner than expected, forcing benefit cuts as early as 2032. Experts warn that the Trust Fund could run dry by 2032, not 2035, with benefits slashed by 33% instead of 23%. This change might force Congress to act faster, possibly leading to tough future choices like tax hikes or retirement age increases. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Social Security Trust Funds are projected to run dry by 2035, but Trump's plan could fast-track the depletion, making it essential for retirees to understand the impact of these changes now. 'The more revenue is stripped away now, the harder it becomes to save Social Security later,' says the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). 'If the funding gap gets bigger, the eventual fix could be more painful,' adding that retirees could face a 33% reduction in benefits by 2035, compared to 23% under current law.

**DOGE Tells HHS Not to Pay Its Bills**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has implemented a new policy called 'Defend the Spend' at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is causing delays in payments to tens of thousands of organizations. According to 12 people familiar with the new arrangements, the policy requires manual review and approval of previously routine payments, resulting in a backlog of payments, including funding for doctors' and nurses' salaries at federal health centers for the poor. As one employee noted, 'It's a fine way to slow down or stop legally obligatory spending while unknown bureaucrats take their time reviewing 'justifications,' then tout anything not spent as 'savings.' This approach is seen as a prototype for a broader effort to disrupt disfavored agencies and deny them the use of congressionally authorized and appropriated funds.

**Poll shows how Utahns feel about DOGE, Trump spending cuts**
A recent poll conducted by HarrisX for the Deseret News shows that Utah voters are split on their views of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its head, Elon Musk. About 46% of voters approve of Musk's job, while 43% disapprove. The sentiments are largely split along party lines, with 72% of Republicans approving and 82% of Democrats disapproving. The poll also shows that Utah voters are divided on the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate wasteful spending, with 28% saying it has done an 'excellent' job and 29% saying it has done a 'poor' job. Again, the sentiments are split along party lines, with 75% of Democrats saying the administration is doing a poor job and 46% of Republicans saying it is doing an 'excellent' job.

**US Suspends Automatic Grant Payments, Causing Delays**
The US Department of Efficiency of Government (DOGE) has temporarily suspended automatic federal grant payments, introducing a mandatory manual review of each payment. This has led to delays in the distribution of funds to tens of thousands of organizations, including centers for the poor. According to Washington Post, 'DOGE is introducing new restrictions on grant payments, requiring manual review of previously routine transactions, which has paralyzed the distribution of funds.' The Defend the Spend program aims to increase transparency, but has caused delays in payments, including those for doctors' salaries in clinics for uninsured patients. 'Some organizations are waiting for payments that were supposed to arrive last week,' the newspaper notes. This move comes after The Wall Street Journal reported that US government spending has increased by $154 billion since Donald Trump took office, compared to the same period in 2024 under Joe Biden's presidency, despite DOGE's efforts. Additionally, the US State Department has canceled foreign grants worth $215 million.

**Trump Administration Considers 40 Billion Dollar Cut to US Department of Health and Human Services**
The Trump administration is considering a 40 billion dollar cut from the US Department of Health and Human Services' budget, according to a Washington Post report. The proposed cuts are part of a broader plan to reduce federal spending, which has been entrusted to Elon Musk. The cuts would target the department's budget for the 2026 fiscal year, which has not yet been approved by Congress. The proposed cuts would amount to one-third of the department's budget, which was 121 billion dollars in the 2024 fiscal year. The total budget for the department is approximately 1.8 trillion dollars, with the majority being mandatory spending related to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In March, the Trump administration launched a wide-ranging restructuring of the department, which included the layoff of nearly a quarter of its employees. The proposed cuts go further, aiming to 'deeply reform and reorganize health and human services agencies'. The plan, according to the Post, includes the merger of multiple branches of the National Institutes of Health and the elimination of programs designed to improve healthcare access in rural areas. As the Washington Post reported, 'The cuts are part of a broader effort to reduce federal spending, which has been entrusted to Elon Musk.'

**DOGE begins to freeze health-care payments for extra review**
The U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has implemented a new initiative called 'Defend the Spend' to manually review and approve federal health-care grants, which has caused a backlog of payments to tens of thousands of organizations. The effort, which aims to create transparency and justify spending, has left thousands of payments backed up, including funding for doctors' and nurses' salaries at federal health centers for the poor. According to 12 people familiar with the new arrangements, the process has been abruptly instituted at the National Institutes for Health, the Administration for Children and Families, and other parts of the Department of Health and Human Services. 'The era of rubber stamping is over,' said an HHS statement. However, current and former federal officials said the process would create bottlenecks and 'strangle grantees with red tape.' Robert Gordon, who served as the HHS assistant secretary of financial resources during the Biden administration, said, 'Instead of cutting red tape, they are strangling grantees with it.' It is unclear whether all the federal health-care grants will be approved and when. 'All funding is on hold,' an NIH official told colleagues at a meeting on Thursday, according to audio obtained by The Post. 'The bottom line is no one is getting any money right now. But they don't know they're not getting any money because it just says that it's 'in transit.''

**America is headed for a grim fiscal reckoning**
The Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) updated long-term projections indicate that the U.S. is on course for a fiscal breakdown. The federal government is currently spending $7 trillion and collecting only $5 trillion in taxes annually, resulting in a deficit of over 6% of GDP. The CBO expects public borrowing to remain at this elevated level or higher for decades, with public debt rising to 100% of GDP this year and 118% by 2035. Republicans are discussing ways to borrow more, including new tax cuts and extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which would increase the national debt by $5 trillion over the next decade and $40 trillion over 30 years. The article argues that a responsible Congress would make deficit reduction its overriding priority and suggests combining moderate tax increases and judicious cuts in spending to restore fiscal control.

**Congress and DOGE can find spending cuts at the Department of Defense**
The growing distance between the US and its NATO allies presents an opportunity for the US to cut costs on military expenditures. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Congress are exploring ways to reduce waste and redundancies in the Department of Defense. A leaked memo revealed that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered senior leaders to develop plans for cutting 8 percent from the defense budget in each of the next five years. Experts, including the Cato Institute's Alex Nowrasteh and Ryan Bourne, recommend reducing the military's global mission and relying on allies to do their share of the work in their own neighborhoods. They suggest trimming the civilian workforce, reducing Army end-strength by 25 percent, and dissolving costly combatant commands. The Congressional Budget Office agrees that the military could be shrunk, proposing a 17 percent reduction in active-component military personnel for a savings of about $1 trillion over 10 years.

**Can America overcome its $30 trillion debt dilemma with tax cuts?**
The US is facing a $30 trillion debt dilemma, which requires $10 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade. Tax cuts since 2000, coupled with increased spending, have been major debt drivers. To stabilize fiscal health, lawmakers should aim to raise revenue, considering more efficient means like a value-added tax, while maintaining progressive tax system elements. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected in 2000 that debt would decline and be zero on net within 10 years, but this didn't happen due to three recessions and higher discretionary spending. Tax cuts have eroded the revenue base, and actual revenue has been lower than CBO's 2000 projections almost every subsequent year. To right the fiscal ship, lawmakers should shift toward more efficient means of raising revenue, like a value-added tax, and preserve the progressivity of the overall tax system.

**Federal Health Spending**
The federal budget problem is a health care problem, with spending on health care subsidies exceeding spending on Social Security and national defense. The Department of Government Efficiency effort aims to make both government and health care more efficient by advocating for dramatic cuts in federal health care subsidies. A mountain of evidence shows that Congress can cut federal health care subsidies dramatically while improving health care and without harming overall health. The longer Congress waits, the worse the dislocation will be. The Cato Institute invites you to join them on February 27 at 12:30 p.m. in the Rayburn House Office Building, Room 2045, to discuss this issue further.

**Trump Praises Musk's Efforts to Reduce Government Spending**
US President Donald Trump expressed his desire for Elon Musk to continue his efforts to reduce government spending, saying 'Elon is doing a great job, but I want him to be bolder... We have a country to save.' Trump appointed Musk as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency to reduce government spending. The Department of Government Efficiency announced that $55 billion has been saved through cost-cutting measures. The department has been auditing federal agencies since Trump's second term began last month, and Musk was tasked with eliminating waste in a unprecedented government reform that includes a comprehensive section of thousands of employees. The department praised the current estimate, which was launched on the department's website on Monday, saying it represents a mix of fraud detection, deletion, contract cancellation, lease cancellation, contract renegotiation, asset sales, grant cancellation, workforce reduction, software changes, and organizational savings. This step is part of the government reform efforts launched by the administration since the beginning of Trump's second term last month. Elon Musk was also appointed as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency to eliminate government waste and improve government performance. This government reform is characterized by tough measures that include firing thousands of government employees. The Department of Government Efficiency announced that the public-facing website will be updated twice a week, allowing for real-time reports on progress made in reducing costs and improving government efficiency, according to the New York Post. The revamped website features a 'dashboard' that displays hundreds of government contracts and other expenses in detail, as well as the savings achieved by the Department of Energy and Natural Resources. These savings include reductions in government subscriptions to news platforms. The basis of the Department of Government Efficiency's estimate of $55 billion has not been clarified. In the 2024 fiscal year, which ended on September 30 last year, the total federal budget was approximately $6.75 trillion, with a budget deficit of around $1.8 trillion. Mathematicians at the Department of Government Efficiency claim to have saved taxpayers around $55 billion through a series of cost-cutting measures since Trump took office last month. Wide-ranging cuts in federal agencies to eliminate waste and abuse. These measures include wide-ranging cuts in federal agencies to eliminate waste and abuse. Elon Musk points out that these cuts have resulted in a savings of $55 billion. The Department of Government Efficiency praised the estimate, which reaches $55 billion, when launching its public-facing website. This number represents a mix of several factors, including fraud detection, deletion, contract cancellation, lease cancellation, contract renegotiation, asset sales, grant cancellation, workforce reduction, software changes, and organizational savings.'

**Federal Spending Cuts: The Math To Lower Deficits Doesn't Add Up**
The federal budget deficit has swelled to 6% of GDP in 2024, roughly twice the average since the 1980s, despite the economy operating at full employment. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that future deficits will remain abnormally high without policy changes. Republicans aim to lower the deficit through spending cuts, but the biggest challenge is that mandatory programs account for 60% of total outlays. President Trump has endorsed scaling back Medicaid, which totals $550 billion, or 8% of total spending. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk aims to reduce the national debt by $2 trillion per year, but its actions have been disputed and criticized for targeting agencies that disagree with. Professor John J. Dilulio, Jr. suggests that the real problem is the contractor state, which accounts for more than three times the federal payroll. He recommends requiring contractors and their executives to disclose donations and contributions to address abuse. Improved government efficiency will not be enough to put the federal budget on sound footing, and the House Republicans' plan would add $2.8 trillion or more to public debt over the next 10 years. The last president to achieve a budgetary surplus was Bill Clinton, who reduced federal government spending and raised taxes to boost revenues.

**The Best Way for DOGE to Cut Government Waste**
Elon Musk's proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) aims to trim $1 trillion in deficit spending from the budget by slashing $4 billion in government spending per day. However, existing government watchdogs, such as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Inspectors General (IGs), have already identified thousands of government reform recommendations that could achieve significant savings. If these recommendations were acted on in a timely manner, the federal government could save between $106 billion and $208 billion. Additionally, the GAO has warned that the federal government loses between $233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud, and implementing good government reforms could save up to half a trillion dollars. Former CBO director Keith Hall suggests that the Congressional Budget Office could play a role in estimating the fiscal effects of reducing government waste by producing annual reports on the open sets of GAO and IG recommendations.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Treasury.gov Federal Budget Data**: Official historical federal budget data from 1930-2026 (estimates). Highly reliable primary source showing federal outlays growing from $3.3 billion in 1930 to estimated $6.75 trillion in 2026. Contains factual data rather than opinions.

2. **Treasury.gov FRED Series Description**: Technical documentation explaining how federal net outlays as percent of GDP is calculated. Purely methodological with no opinions.

3. **UCSB Presidency Statistics**: Contains factual data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) showing recent historical federal net outlays:
   - FY 2024: 6,751,552 million
   - FY 2023: 6,134,526 million
   - FY 2022: 6,273,259 million
   - FY 2021: 6,822,461 million
   - FY 2020: 6,553,620 million

4. **Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) on CBO's June 2024 Update**: Summarizes CBO's June 2024 projections. CRFB is a fiscally conservative organization, but the summary focuses on factual CBO data rather than opinions. Shows projections through 2034, including debt rising to 122.4% of GDP by then, and annual deficits reaching $2.9 trillion (6.9% of GDP) by FY 2034.

5. **CRFB on February 2024 CBO Baseline**: Similar to above but uses February 2024 CBO data. Projects FY 2028 outlays at approximately $7.9 trillion (24.4% of GDP).

6. **Perplexity Report**: Compilation of historical data (FY2000-2024) and CBO projections (FY2025-2028). Generally factual though some analysis may introduce bias. Confirms FY 2028 projection of $7.9 trillion (24.4% of GDP) and identifies key drivers: Social Security growth, Medicare spending increase of 5.3% annually, and interest costs reaching $1.1 trillion by FY 2028.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several potential reference classes:

1. **Historical growth rate**: Federal outlays have grown at varying rates historically, with significant spikes during crises (2008-2009, 2020-2021) followed by relative stabilization.

2. **Outlays as percentage of GDP**: Since 1980, federal outlays have averaged about 21% of GDP, but are currently higher (23-24%) and projected to increase.

3. **CBO projections**: Most suitable reference class as they incorporate economic forecasts, demographic trends, interest rate projections, and existing legislation.

4. **Post-crisis spending patterns**: Less relevant since we're several years past COVID crisis spending.

The CBO projection framework is the most appropriate reference class as it specifically models the variable we're forecasting with comprehensive inputs.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The forecast target is FY 2028 (October 1, 2027 - September 30, 2028), approximately 3 years from today. Recent historical patterns show:

- FY 2020-2021: Significant pandemic-related spending spike
- FY 2022-2023: Post-pandemic reduction in outlays
- FY 2024: Increase to $6.75 trillion (partly due to rising interest costs)

CBO projections show relatively steady growth from FY 2024 through FY 2028:
- FY 2025: ~$7.0 trillion
- FY 2026: ~$7.3 trillion 
- FY 2028: ~$7.9 trillion

This implies roughly 4-5% annual growth in outlays, driven by demographic factors, rising interest costs, and baseline spending increases.

## (d) Justification

Based on the reference class and timeframe analysis, I can establish the following key drivers for my forecast:

1. **Demographic drivers**: The aging U.S. population will increase Social Security and Medicare spending predictably through 2028.

2. **Interest costs**: Projected to rise significantly, reaching $1.1 trillion annually by FY 2028 (from $663 billion in FY 2024) due to elevated federal debt and interest rates.

3. **Mandatory program growth**: Social Security expenditures projected to grow from $1.2 trillion to $1.6 trillion by FY 2028; Medicare expected to grow at 5.3% annually.

4. **Economic cycles**: Any recession between now and FY 2028 could trigger increased countercyclical spending.

5. **Policy uncertainty**: New legislation could either increase or decrease outlays.

6. **Trust fund insolvency**: Highway Trust Fund insolvency projected in FY 2028, potentially requiring general fund transfers.

The CBO's projection of $7.9 trillion for FY 2028 provides a strong central estimate, incorporating these factors based on current law. Historical accuracy of CBO projections suggests actual outcomes typically fall within ±10% of projections at this time horizon, but outliers are possible with major policy changes or economic shocks.

## Outside view calibration:

For my calibration, I'm using the CBO projection of $7.9 trillion (7,900,000 million) as my median estimate, with appropriate ranges to account for uncertainty:

**Lower percentiles** (10th-40th): These capture scenarios where outlays are lower than CBO projects due to:
- Stronger economic growth reducing safety net spending
- Legislative efforts to constrain spending
- Lower-than-projected interest rates
- Entitlement reforms
- Reduced military engagements

**Higher percentiles** (60th-90th): These capture scenarios where outlays exceed CBO projections due to:
- Economic downturn triggering automatic stabilizers or stimulus
- New military conflicts or security threats
- Natural disasters or health emergencies
- Additional social spending legislation
- Higher interest rates increasing debt service costs
- Accelerated demographic pressures on entitlements

Historical forecasting accuracy suggests a wider range is appropriate. CBO's own retrospective analyses show forecasts 3-5 years out often have mean absolute errors of several percentage points of GDP, particularly when policy changes or economic conditions differ from baseline assumptions.

## Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7,110,000
Percentile 20: 7,426,000
Percentile 40: 7,742,000
Percentile 60: 8,058,000
Percentile 80: 8,532,000
Percentile 90: 9,085,000

1. **Fiscal Data Treasury dataset (Federal Budget Receipts and Outlays)**: Official U.S. Treasury data from 1930 through 2026 estimates, showing the long-term growth of federal spending from $3.3 billion in 1930 to projected $6,746.3 billion in 2026. High-quality primary source with factual historical data, though projections only extend to 2026.

2. **Fiscal Data Treasury guide on federal spending**: Technical explanation of the FRED series FYONGDA188S (Federal Net Outlays as Percent of GDP). Purely factual reference material with no projections or opinions.

3. **Presidency UCSB statistics on federal budget**: Provides recent historical values for Federal Net Outlays (FYONET) through FY 2024 ($6,751,552 million). High-quality factual data, but no forward projections.

4. **CBO publication 52370**: Summary of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's June 2024 press release on the CBO's June 2024 baseline. Contains factual projections from the nonpartisan CBO, with projected spending of $84.9 trillion (24.1% of GDP) over 2025-2034. Projects annual spending to reach $10.3 trillion (24.9% of GDP) by FY 2034.

5. **CRFB blog on CBO's February 2024 baseline**: Similar to above but based on February data. Reports annual outlays projected at $7.0 trillion (23.3% of GDP) in FY 2025, $7.3 trillion (23.6% of GDP) in FY 2026, and cites key drivers including interest costs, demographic shifts, and healthcare inflation.

6. **Perplexity report**: Compiled data showing historical outlays and CBO projections, including specifically for FY 2028: $7.9 trillion (24.4% of GDP). While sourced from reputable data, this is an AI-generated compilation rather than a primary source.

## Reference Class Analysis:

Several potential reference classes exist:

1. **Historical growth trend (FY 2000-2024)**: Long-term growth pattern shows federal outlays increasing from $1.79 trillion in FY 2000 to $6.75 trillion in FY 2024, though with significant volatility during crises.

2. **Recent post-pandemic normalization (FY 2022-2024)**: After the COVID spending spike, outlays dropped to $6.27 trillion in FY 2022, then rose to $6.13 trillion in FY 2023 and $6.75 trillion in FY 2024, showing a return to growth trend.

3. **CBO projections (FY 2025-2028)**: The most relevant reference class, as these incorporate economic forecasts, policy assumptions, demographic trends, and interest rate projections. CBO projects spending growth to approximately $7.9 trillion by FY 2028.

The CBO projection reference class is most suitable because it incorporates forward-looking analysis of structural factors driving federal spending.

## Timeframe Analysis:

The forecast targets FY 2028, approximately 3.5 years from now (April 2025 to September 2028). Key factors during this timeframe:

- **Demographic pressures**: Social Security outlays projected to grow from $1.2 trillion (FY 2024) to $1.6 trillion (FY 2028) as more Baby Boomers retire
- **Interest costs**: Projected to reach $1.1 trillion (3.4% of GDP) by FY 2028, exceeding defense spending
- **Healthcare inflation**: Medicare spending expected to grow 5.3% annually
- **Highway Trust Fund insolvency**: Projected in FY 2028, potentially requiring federal intervention

Historical growth patterns over similar timeframes show annual growth rates of:
- Pre-pandemic (FY 2016-2020): ~5.9% average annual growth
- Including pandemic (FY 2020-2024): ~3.0% average annual growth with high volatility
- CBO projected growth (FY 2024-2028): ~3.7-4.0% average annual growth

## Justification:

Starting from the most recent actual figure of $6,751,552 million in FY 2024, and applying the CBO-projected growth rate of approximately 3.7-4.0% annually, we arrive at an expected value around $7.8-7.9 trillion for FY 2028.

Several factors could push outlays higher:
- Economic downturn requiring fiscal stimulus
- Higher-than-expected interest rates (significant impact given record debt levels)
- New military conflicts or security challenges
- Natural disasters or other emergency spending
- Healthcare cost growth exceeding projections

Factors that could reduce outlays:
- Fiscal austerity measures following a change in administration or Congress
- Lower-than-expected interest rates
- Stronger economic growth reducing safety net spending needs
- Structural reforms to entitlement programs

The upside risks appear more numerous and likely than downside risks, given the structural pressures from demographics, interest costs, and the historical difficulty in reducing federal spending once established.

## Outside view calibration:

Given that federal outlays are driven by relatively predictable factors (demographics, interest rates, economic growth) but also subject to political decisions and unexpected events, I'll calibrate a distribution that:

1. Centers around the CBO's projected ~$7.9 trillion figure for FY 2028
2. Accounts for historical volatility in federal spending
3. Acknowledges that spending can increase rapidly during crises but tends to decline more slowly
4. Incorporates the 3.5-year forecast horizon, which increases uncertainty

For the 10th percentile, I'll consider a scenario with significant fiscal restraint, lower interest rates than expected, and no major emergencies. This would limit annual growth to around 1.5-2.0%.

For the 90th percentile, I'll consider a scenario with a recession requiring fiscal stimulus, higher interest rates, and potential new spending initiatives. This could push annual growth to 6.5-7.0%.

The middle percentiles will represent more moderate deviations from the CBO baseline.

2. Reference‑class analysis  
   Potential classes:  
     1. Historical nominal net outlays series (FY 2000–FY 2024)  
     2. CBO baseline projections for net outlays (FY 2025–FY 2028)  
     3. Net outlays growth in 3–4‑year windows historically  
   Evaluation:  
     – Class 1 gives raw baseline but omits future policy shocks.  
     – Class 2 embodies CBO’s expert view, but may understate upside if interest costs or legislation change.  
     – Class 3 captures realized volatility over similar horizons; suitable for setting distribution width.  
   Chosen reference: blend of Class 1 for central tendency and Class 3 for volatility calibration, anchored to CBO baseline (Class 2).

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Forecast horizon: ~3.5 years (April 2025 → FY 2028 close, data published ~Oct/Nov 2028).  
   – Historical analogs: net‑outlay windows from FY 2020→FY 2023 (3 years) saw +\$377 b (2020:6.554→2023:6.134 lower due to receipts surge), and FY 2021→FY 2024 (3 years) saw –\$71 b (6.822→6.752). Longer windows vary ±\$400 b.  
   – Multi‑year CAGR has averaged roughly 3–6% in decades prior to COVID; pandemic period spiked to ~10% then reversed.

4. Justification for outside‑view baseline  
   – Starting point: FY 2024 net outlays of 6,751,552 million (FRED).  
   – CBO June 2024 baseline implies gradual rise in outlays driven by mandatory spending and interest: net outlays roughly flat in nominal terms near \$6.7 trillion through FY 2026, then rising toward \$7.9 trillion by FY 2028 (Perplexity synthesis).  
   – Treasury’s FY 2026 outlay estimate of \$6,746 b suggests outlays plateau near current levels absent new legislation or recessions.  
   – Mandatory programs + interest costs suggest upward pressure; discretionary caps (FRA) moderate growth; political fights may introduce ephemeral spending increases or cut threats.  
   – Historical 3–4 year windows (pre‑COVID) saw nominal increases of \$400–600 b (3–5% CAGR). Applying a mid‑range 4% CAGR to \$6.75 trillion yields \$8.0 trillion in FY 2028.  
   – Risks: recession could reduce receipts and increase outlays (higher net outlays), pushing FY 2028 above \$8.2 trillion; policy reforms or spending caps could limit growth to \$7.5 trillion or lower.

Outside view calibration:

We aim for a wide 90–10 interval reflecting known‑unknowns:  
– Lower tail (P10) anchors minimal growth scenario: plateau then minor rise to \$7.0 trillion.  
– Upper tail (P90) covers recession‑plus‑interest shock, pushing net outlays toward \$8.8 trillion.  
– Central 50% around CBO‑informed 4% CAGR projection (~\$8.0 trillion).

Analysis:

1. Source Analysis  
- FiscalData Treasury “Federal Budget Receipts and Outlays” (data through estimates for FY 2026)  
  • Factual table covering FY 1930–FY 2026 (billion \$). High reliability: official Treasury statements. Last updated October 2024 (preliminary FY 2024, estimates FY 2025–26).  
- FRED series FYONGDA188S (Net Outlays as % of GDP) via America’s Finance Guide  
  • Derived from OMB and BEA data. Measures net outlays/GDP annually. Reliable for understanding fiscal ratios. First published January 2013; subject to revisions.  
- FRED series FYONET (Federal Net Outlays in millions) via UCSB Presidency site  
  • Official OMB figures. Annual, fiscal‑year. Reliable; prior years published Jan/Feb, most recent preliminary in October. FY 2024: 6,751,552.  
- CBO June 2024 Baseline (via Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget)  
  • Projects deficits, debt‑to‑GDP, spending vs. revenues over FY 2024–34. Authoritative expert forecasts; last updated June 2024. Contains judgments on interest rates, demographic pressures.  
- CRFB summary of CBO February 2024 Outlook  
  • Similar to above but earlier. Highlights drivers (trust‐fund insolvencies, mandatory spending growth). Reliable secondary source of CBO analysis.  
- Perplexity‐generated report on outlays FY2000–FY2028  
  • Mixed reliability. Includes some Wikipedia references and expert reports but may conflate gross spending and net outlays. Use with caution; extract only broadly consistent historical figures.

2. Reference Class Analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
- Historical net outlays FY2000–FY2024 (absolute growth patterns).  
- CBO baseline projections for FY 2025–FY 2028 (spending % of GDP and deficits).  
- Net outlays as % of GDP over time, mapped to GDP projections.  
Suitability: CBO baseline % of GDP mapped to nominal GDP best captures expected structural drivers (interest, entitlements) over 4‑year horizon. Historical absolute growth shows high volatility around crises. We tether our baseline to CBO’s FY 2028 spending rate (24.4% of GDP) and current nominal GDP trajectory.

3. Timeframe Analysis  
• Horizon: ~4.5 years (from Q2 2025 to October 2028 data release).  
• Historical analog: FY 2024→FY 2028  
  – FY 2022–FY 2026 estimated net outlays rose from \$6.273 T to \$6.746 T (+7.6% over 4 years).  
  – Crises (2008–09, 2020–21) produced 25–50% swings in 2–3 years; absent crises, growth has averaged 3–5% annually.  
• GDP growth: CBO projects ~4–5% nominal GDP growth p.a. through FY 2028.

4. Justification for Outside View Baseline  
• CBO projects net outlays to stabilize at ~24.4% of GDP in FY 2028.  
• Assume nominal GDP FY 2028 ≈ \$30.4 trillion (projecting \$27.7 T in FY 2025 growing 4.5% p.a. over 3 years).  
• 0.244 × \$30.4 T = \$7.42 T.  
• Receipts + deficits approach: receipts ~17.8% of GDP ⇒ \$5.4 T; projected deficit ~\$1.8 T ⇒ outlays ≈ \$7.2 T.  
• Average these two CBO‐based methods ⇒ \$7.31 T.  
• Historical forecasting error vs. CBO baseline (~3–4%) suggests slight upside risk if interest costs or entitlements accelerate.  
• Policy uncertainties (debt‑ceiling standoffs, trust‐fund insolvency adjustments) could skew by ±5%.

Outside View Calibration  
• Base distribution anchored at \$7.31 T (7,310,000 million).  
• Allow 90/10 interval wide enough to cover:  
   – Lower tail: mild fiscal consolidation, higher receipts, slower interest growth.  
   – Upper tail: additional stimulus, faster entitlement/inflation pressures, higher interest costs.  
• Tether to historical forecast error: CBO 5‑year out‐year outlay projections have ~±7% error (one‑sided). We adopt ±10% around baseline for 10th–90th percentiles.
