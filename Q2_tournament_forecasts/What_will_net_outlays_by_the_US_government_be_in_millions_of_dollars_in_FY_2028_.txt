Analysis:
The key to an outside view for FY 2028 net outlays is understanding the long‑term nominal growth trend and major drivers (entitlements, defense, net interest, cyclical shocks). Historically, net outlays have grown at roughly 4–6% nominal annually, rising from ~$3.5 trillion in FY 2000 to ~$6.75 trillion in FY 2024, with notable spikes around 2009 (financial crisis) and 2020–21 (COVID relief). Outlays as a share of GDP have hovered between 18% and 25%, driven upward by entitlement growth and higher interest costs when rates rise. To establish a baseline, we need FRED’s FYONET series back to at least 2000 and CBO’s historical outlay tables. This will give us average annual growth, volatility, and sub‐component trends. With that outview in hand, we can later layer in inside‐view adjustments for Trump Administration/DOGE savings targets, anticipated reconciliation cuts, and trajectory of interest rates.

<Summary source="https://usafacts.org/government-spending/">
The Presidency.ucsb article “Federal Budget Receipts and Outlays” presents annual U.S. federal budget data from FY 1930 through estimated FY 2026. For each year it lists:

• Receipts (billions of current dollars)  
• Outlays (billions)  
• Surplus or deficit (billions)  
• Nominal GDP (billions)  
• Receipts and outlays as % of GDP  
• Surplus/deficit as % of GDP  

Key trends and figures:  
1. 1930s–1940s: Outlays surged in WWII (e.g. FY 1943 outlays \$78.6 bn (42.6% GDP) vs. receipts \$24.0 bn (13.0%), deficit \$54.6 bn / –29.6% GDP).  
2. Late 1940s–1950s: Brief postwar surpluses (FY 1947–49; FY 1951, ’56–57), then return to small deficits.  
3. 1969 onward: Persistent deficits; deficit/GDP around 2–4% through the 1970s–80s, peaking at –5.9% GDP in FY 1983.  
4. Late 1990s–2001: Three consecutive surpluses (FY 1998 +0.8% GDP, FY 1999 +1.3%, FY 2000 +2.3%).  
5. Post‑2001: Deficits resume; FY 2009 spike to –9.8% GDP (deficit \$1,412.7 bn) amid the financial crisis.  
6. COVID‑19 era:  
   – FY 2020 outlays \$6,550.4 bn (31.2% GDP), receipts \$3,421.2 bn (16.3%), deficit \$3,129.2 bn / –14.9% GDP  
   – FY 2021 est. outlays \$7,249.5 bn (32.9%), deficit \$3,668.7 bn / –16.7%  
7. Recovery period:  
   – FY 2022 outlays \$6,011.1 bn (25.6% GDP), deficit \$1,837.0 bn / –7.8%  
   – FY 2023 est. deficit –5.6% GDP; FY 2024 est. –5.3%  
   – FY 2025 est. deficit –5.5%  
   – FY 2026 est. receipts \$5,332.1 bn (19.4%), outlays \$6,746.3 bn (24.5%), deficit \$1,414.2 bn / –5.1%  

Overall, the table shows how federal outlays and deficits have evolved through Great Depression, WWII, postwar surpluses, 1980s deficits, late‑1990s surpluses, the 2008 crisis, and the COVID‑19 fiscal response, ending with gradually shrinking projected deficits by FY 2026.

Bipartisan Policy Center’s Deficit Tracker (monthly through February 2025)

• Overall FY 2025 deficit:  
  – $1.1 trillion at end-February (18% above same point in FY 2024)  
  – Revenues up 2% versus last year (last year’s receipts were boosted by delayed 2023 filings)  
  – Outlays (major mandatory programs + net interest) continue to outpace revenues  

• February 2025 (CBO estimate):  
  – $308 billion monthly deficit (includes March payments shifted forward)  
  – After timing adjustments: deficit up $15 billion (5%) YoY; spending up $41 billion (11%)  
    • +$15 billion refundable tax credits (higher enrollment in premium‑assistance health plans)  
    • Increased disaster‑relief outlays via DHS/FEMA  

• FY 2025 Year‑to‑Date (Oct 1–end‑Feb):  
  – Outlays $200 billion (7%) above same FY 2024 period (timing‑adjusted)  
  – Tax receipts $37 billion (2%) above, reflecting shift of some FY 2023 payments  

• January 2025 recap:  
  – Cumulative deficit $838 billion (24% above Jan 2024)  
  – Revenues up 1% (again boosted last year by delayed filings)  
  – Monthly deficit (CBO): $127 billion; adjusted up $20 billion (11%) YoY  
    • Spending up $55 billion (11%), including +$7 billion for VA benefits  
    • Receipts up $36 billion (8%)  

• FYTD Oct 1–Jan 31: outlays $157 billion (7%) above prior year; receipts $11 billion (1%) above  

• December 2024: $85 billion deficit (down $44 billion YoY)  
• November 2024: $365 billion deficit (up $51 billion YoY)  

• Net interest outlays have soared following Fed rate hikes. Recent CPI (Dec +0.4% m/m; +2.9% y/y) and employment gains (256,000 jobs; 4.1% unemployment) prompted a 0.25 pp Fed funds cut in December to 4.25–4.5%. Yet 10‑year Treasury yields rose on signals of cautious further easing.  

• Funding & debt limit: December continuing resolution extends funding to mid‑March 2025 but leaves the $36.1 trillion statutory debt limit unresolved. Treasury is relying on cash reserves and “extraordinary measures”—BPC is tracking the projected “X Date” when these run out.  

• Policy options: In December, the CBO released a compendium of 76 ten‑year deficit‑reduction options (no recommendations). BPC also issued its own fiscally responsible options for the 2025 tax negotiations.

<Summary source="https://www.pgpf.org/article/national-debt-on-track-to-reach-record-high-in-just-four-years/">
Below is a concise summary of the Peterson Foundation article “National Debt on Track to Reach Record High in Just Four Years.” All projections and data below come from the Peterson‐commissioned analysis of Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections.

1. Debt and Deficits  
- Debt held by the public was 98 percent of GDP in 2024.  
- By 2029, debt is projected to exceed the all‐time high of 106 percent of GDP (WWII level).  
- Debt rises further to 118.5 percent of GDP by 2035.  
- Annual budget deficits climb from \$1.7 trillion in 2026 to \$2.5 trillion in 2035.  
- Deficits remain at or above 6 percent of GDP through most of the next decade.

2. Economic Growth  
- Real GDP growth is forecast to slow from 2.7 percent in 2024 to 2.1 percent in 2025, then average about 1.8 percent annually through 2035—below the often‑cited 3 percent target.

3. Interest Rates and Interest Costs  
- Federal funds rate rose from near zero (March 2020) to 5.25–5.5 percent (July 2023), then began edging down starting September 2024.  
- CBO expects 3‑month T‑bill rates to fall from 4.2 percent in Q1 2025 to 3.0 percent by 2033, then hold steady.  
- The 10‑year Treasury yield is projected at 4.0 percent in 2025 (down from 4.2 percent in 2024), then easing to 3.9 percent in 2026 and 3.8 percent by 2031–2035.  
- Interest payments jumped from \$352 billion in 2021 to \$881 billion in 2024 and are projected to reach \$1.8 trillion by 2035.  
- Over the next decade, total interest costs amount to \$13.8 trillion.  
- Net interest outlays, which peaked at 3.2 percent of GDP in 1991, are set to exceed that share in the coming year.

4. Mandatory Spending Trends  
- Medicare outlays rise from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2026 to 4.0 percent by 2035.  
- Social Security spending grows from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2026 to 6.0 percent in 2035.

5. Revenues  
- Federal revenues increase from 17.1 percent of GDP in 2025 to 18.2 percent in 2027, partly due to expiring Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions.  
- From 2028 to 2035, revenues stabilize at about 18.1 percent of GDP.  
- CBO’s projections assume no further tax policy changes beyond those expirations.

6. Conclusion/Outlook  
- The report warns that without policy changes to address the structural mismatch between spending and revenues—compounded by rising interest costs—the federal fiscal path is unsustainable.  
- Higher debt levels plus elevated interest rates increase borrowing costs and risk crowding out other priorities if left unaddressed.

Query: Provide historical data and trend analysis for US federal net outlays from FY2000 through FY2023, including amounts, share of GDP, and key drivers
# Historical Analysis of US Federal Net Outlays from FY2000 to FY2023  

Federal net outlays in the United States experienced profound growth between fiscal years 2000 and 2023, escalating from $1.79 trillion to $6.13 trillion—a 242% nominal increase[2][7]. This expansion significantly outpaced economic growth, with federal spending rising from 17.45% of GDP in 2000 to 22.13% in 2023[3][7]. Key drivers included mandatory spending programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which expanded due to demographic shifts and policy changes, alongside rising interest payments fueled by mounting debt and higher rates[4][8]. Discretionary spending, particularly defense and pandemic-related initiatives, further accelerated outlays, while tax policies like the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act exacerbated deficits[4][11]. The COVID-19 pandemic marked a pivotal moment, with emergency spending driving temporary spikes, though structural deficits persisted post-crisis[5][10].  

---

## Historical Trends in Federal Net Outlays  

### Absolute Spending Growth  
Federal net outlays surged from $1.79 trillion in FY2000 to $6.13 trillion in FY2023, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6%[2][7]. This growth was nonlinear, with notable accelerations during economic crises. For instance, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis saw outlays rise from $2.98 trillion in 2008 to $3.52 trillion in 2009—an 18% single-year increase—as stimulus measures and automatic stabilizers activated[3][9]. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a $2.1 trillion escalation between FY2019 ($4.45 trillion) and FY2021 ($6.82 trillion), driven by relief packages like the CARES Act[3][11]. Post-pandemic, spending remained elevated at $6.13 trillion in FY2023, 40% above pre-2019 levels despite economic recovery[11].  

### Per Capita Spending  
Population-adjusted outlays reveal intensified fiscal commitments. Per capita federal spending grew from $6,350 in 2000 to $18,300 in 2023 (adjusted for inflation to 2024 dollars), a 188% increase[1][2]. This trend underscores the federal government’s expanding role in areas such as healthcare, income support, and debt servicing, even as population growth averaged 0.7% annually[1][9].  

---

## Federal Outlays as a Percentage of GDP  

### Long-Term Trends  
The federal spending-to-GDP ratio climbed from 17.45% in 2000 to 22.13% in 2023, eclipsing the 20th-century average of 18.48%[3][7]. This ratio peaked at 30.69% in FY2020 during pandemic-driven spending, highlighting the elasticity of federal outlays during crises[3]. Despite post-2020 moderation, structural factors like aging demographics and healthcare inflation kept the ratio above 22%—a level last seen during World War II[3][9].  

### Post-2008 and Pandemic Surges  
The 2008 crisis precipitated a sustained shift, with the spending-to-GDP ratio averaging 23.1% from 2009–2023, compared to 19.5% from 2000–2008[3][9]. Pandemic-era measures pushed this ratio to 30.69% in FY2020, as outlays reached $6.82 trillion against a contracting GDP[3][11]. Mandatory programs and interest payments accounted for 70% of FY2023 spending, perpetuating elevated post-crisis baselines[4][8].  

---

## Key Drivers of Spending Growth  

### Mandatory Spending Programs  
**Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid** collectively represented 45% of FY2023 outlays, up from 38% in 2000[4][9]. Social Security spending alone grew from $406 billion in 2000 to $1.24 trillion in 2023, driven by a 33% increase in beneficiaries and inflation-adjusted benefit hikes[4][8]. Medicare expenditures tripled to $1.02 trillion over the same period, fueled by rising enrollment (from 40 million to 67 million) and per-capita healthcare costs[4][9]. Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and pandemic-related eligibility adjustments added $592 billion in FY2023, double 2000 levels[8][9].  

### Discretionary Spending  
Defense and non-defense discretionary spending fluctuated with policy priorities. Defense outlays rose from $295 billion in 2000 to $767 billion in 2023, reflecting post-9/11 engagements and modernization initiatives[8][11]. Non-defense discretionary programs, including education and infrastructure, expanded from $350 billion to $1.2 trillion, with pandemic-era supplements like the American Rescue Plan ($1.9 trillion) contributing to transient spikes[5][11].  

### Interest on the Debt  
Net interest payments surged from $222 billion (1.3% of GDP) in 2000 to $659 billion (2.5% of GDP) in 2023, driven by cumulative deficits and rising rates[4][8]. The Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, aimed at curbing post-pandemic inflation, pushed the effective interest rate on public debt from 1.6% in 2021 to 3.1% in 2023[4][8]. Interest costs are projected to exceed $1 trillion annually by 2030, rivaling defense spending[4].  

---

## Policy and Economic Factors Influencing Outlays  

### Tax Policies  
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, contributing to a $1.8 trillion revenue shortfall over a decade[4][11]. While proponents argued growth effects would offset losses, real GDP growth averaged 2.3% post-2017—below the 3% target—exacerbating deficits[4][10]. Individual income tax revenues, however, rose from $1.1 trillion in 2017 to $2.2 trillion in 2023 due to wage growth and bracket creep[6][10].  

### Economic Crises  
The 2008 and 2020 recessions prompted countercyclical spending, expanding automatic stabilizers like unemployment insurance and discretionary measures like the Troubled Asset Relief Program ($700 billion) and Paycheck Protection Program ($800 billion)[9][11]. These interventions stabilized GDP but entrenched higher spending baselines; for example, non-defense discretionary outlays remained 25% above pre-pandemic projections by FY2023[10][11].  

---

## Contemporary Challenges and Future Projections  

### Post-2023 Outlook  
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects net outlays to reach $7.3 trillion by 2025, with the spending-to-GDP ratio stabilizing near 23%[2][8]. Mandatory programs will dominate growth, as Social Security and Medicare face a 75% enrollment increase by 2040[4][9]. Interest costs are expected to surpass $1.6 trillion annually by 2033, consuming 25% of federal revenues[4][8].  

### Sustainability Concerns  
With federal debt held by the public at $26.3 trillion (97% of GDP) in 2023, policymakers face pressure to curb deficits through entitlement reform, revenue increases, or spending caps[6][8]. However, structural political barriers and aging demographics suggest continued fiscal expansion, risking macroeconomic instability through crowding-out effects and inflationary pressures[4][9].

By synthesizing expenditure trends, economic drivers, and policy impacts, this analysis underscores the structural challenges in balancing fiscal responsibility with evolving public demands. Historical data reveals a federal budget increasingly shaped by mandatory commitments and compounding interest, necessitating bipartisan reforms to ensure long-term sustainability.</Perplexity_report>

<Summary source="https://www.cbo.gov/topics/budget/outlook-budget-and-economy">
Here is a concise summary of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s “Analysis of CBO’s March 2025 Long‑Term Budget Outlook” (March 27, 2025), which reports on the Congressional Budget Office’s latest long‑term projections under current law and on the impact of extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

• Reported Source  
  – Congressional Budget Office (CBO), March 2025 Long‑Term Budget Outlook, via CRFB.

• Debt‑to‑GDP Projections (Current‑Law Baseline)  
  – 100 percent of GDP at end of FY 2025  
  – 107 percent by FY 2029  
  – 156 percent by FY 2055  
  – Nominal federal debt held by the public rises from \$30 trillion now to \$138 trillion by 2055 (Δ +\$108 trillion).

• Impact of Extending TCJA  
  – Adds roughly \$40 trillion to debt over 30 years  
  – Would push debt above 200 percent of GDP by 2055.

• Deficit Trends and Projections  
  – FY 2001: balanced;  
    2001–2008: averaged 2.4 percent of GDP;  
    2016: over 3 percent;  
    2025 (projected): 6.2 percent.  
  – Projected to rise to 7.3 percent of GDP by 2055.  
  – Nominal deficits: \$442 billion in 2015 → \$1.9 trillion in 2025 → \$2.5 trillion by 2035 → \$6.4 trillion by 2055.  
  – With TCJA extension: deficits could reach ~11 percent of GDP by 2055.

• Interest‑Cost Dynamics  
  – Interest paid on debt:  
    1.6 percent of GDP in 2020 → 3.2 percent in 2025 (record) → 4.1 percent by 2035 → 4.6 percent by 2045 → 5.4 percent by 2055.  
  – By 2055, interest would consume 28 percent of total federal revenue.  
  – Under TCJA extension, interest costs could approach 8 percent of GDP by 2055.  
  – CBO projects the average interest rate on debt will exceed nominal GDP growth (R > G) by 2045.

• Spending vs. Revenue Shares of GDP  
  – Total spending: 20.7 percent in 2016 → 23.3 percent in 2025 → 24.4 percent by 2035 → 26.6 percent by 2055 (50‑year average: 21.1 percent).  
  – Revenues: 17.1 percent in 2025 → 18.2 percent by 2027 → 18.9 percent by 2045 → 19.3 percent by 2055 (50‑year average: 17.3 percent).  
  – Growing gap driven mainly by:  
    • Health care spending: 5.8 → 8.1 percent of GDP (2025→2055)  
    • Social Security: 5.2 → 6.1 percent  
    • Net interest: 3.2 → 5.4 percent  

• Trust‑Fund Solvency Risks  
  – Social Security OASI trust fund insolvent by FY 2033 → 24 percent cut in benefits on day one, rising to 28 percent by 2055.  
  – SSDI fund solvent through at least 2055; using its surpluses to shore up OASI extends solvency only to 2034 (then 21 percent cut, rising to 26 percent).  
  – Highway Trust Fund projected insolvent by 2028.  
  – Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund insolvent by 2052 (outlook improved vs. prior year but remains sensitive).

• Comparison to CBO’s March 2024 Outlook  
  – Debt projection for 2054 revised down from 166 percent to 154 percent of GDP.  
  – Deficit projection for 2054 revised down from 8.5 percent to 7.2 percent of GDP.  
  – Largely driven by higher projected revenues (e.g., asset values) and lower assumed long‑term interest rates (10‑year Treasury yield projected at 3.8 percent vs. 4.4 percent previously).

• Key Takeaway  
  – Under current law, the federal budget is on an unsustainable path: rapidly rising debt and interest costs, growing mismatch between spending and revenue, and multiple trust‑fund insolvencies loom without policy changes. Extending expiring tax cuts without offsets would worsen these trends dramatically.

Disclaimer: The extracted content appears incomplete. Summary is based solely on the provided text.

Key Facts and Statistics  
• The U.S. federal budget reflects government priorities in spending and revenue, with primary expenditures on healthcare, retirement (Social Security), and defense.  
• In FY 2022, total outlays were $6.3 trillion, equal to 25.1% of GDP. Major categories:  
  – Medicare & Medicaid: $1.339 T (5.4% of GDP)  
  – Social Security: $1.2 T (4.8%)  
  – Non‑defense discretionary: $910 B (3.6%)  
  – Defense Department: $751 B (3.0%)  
  – Net interest: $475 B (1.9%)  
• CBO projections (Feb 2024): federal debt held by the public rises from 99% of GDP in 2024 to 116% in 2034 and 172% in 2054 if current law holds.  
• CBO projects a budget deficit of $1.6 T (5.6% of GDP) in 2024, rising to 6.1% of GDP in 2025, dipping slightly in 2026–27, then rising back to 6.1% by 2034 with a $2.6 T shortfall.

Budget Process and Governance  
• The President submits a budget proposal each February; Congress must pass appropriations bills by September 30 or enact stop‑gap (“continuing”) resolutions or omnibus bills.  
• Key oversight and analysis bodies: Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Treasury Department.  
• Authorization vs. Appropriations: Separate committees handle authorization (permission to create programs) and appropriations (funding those programs). There are 12 appropriations subcommittees in each house.  
• “Emergency” or supplemental appropriations can bypass certain budget enforcement rules (e.g., disaster relief, wars in Iraq/Afghanistan).  

Accounting Basis and Definitions  
• Federal budgets use cash accounting: revenues and outlays are recorded when cash changes hands. This underreports long‑term obligations of programs like Medicare and Social Security compared to accrual accounting.  
• Outlays = actual disbursements to liquidate obligations; budget authority = legal authority to incur obligations. Differences arise because multi‑year obligations may draw on prior-year budget authority.

Opinions and Projections  
• Non‑partisan CBO warns that rising interest costs and mandatory spending (healthcare, retirement) outpace revenue growth, driving up debt under current law (CBO, Feb 2024).  

Potential Gaps

Key Points  
1. Establishment of DOGE  
   • On January 20 2025, President Trump signed a day‑one executive order creating the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a quasi‑governmental agency led by Elon Musk.  
   • According to the article, this is the first new federal agency that has “shrunk the federal government and the size of the bureaucracy.”  

2. DOGE’s Activities  
   • DOGE staff “expose waste, fraud, and abuse” and flag them directly to the President with the aim of eliminating programs and reducing spending.  

3. Reported Savings  
   • As of April 17 2025, DOGE has averaged $1.8 billion in savings per day since January 20.

<Summary source="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302705/doge-overstates-savings-federal-contracts">
Here’s a concise summary of the NPR article “DOGE released data about federal contract savings. It doesn’t add up” by Stephen Fowler (Feb. 19, 2025):

Facts & findings  
• DOGE’s online “savings tracker” claims $55 billion in total federal spending cuts, including $8.5 billion from contract and lease cancellations (down from an initial $16 billion claim).  
• NPR reviewed the roughly 1,100 “cancelled” contracts DOGE listed and finds:  
  – Roughly half of the original $16 billion claim traced to an ICE contract entry that was a typo ($8 billion should have been $8 million). DOGE says it used the $8 million figure in its calculations, but its site repeatedly linked to the outdated $8 billion entry.  
  – Over $6.5 billion in alleged savings come from contracts that haven’t actually been terminated or closed out.  
  – Some listings (e.g., a billion‑dollar SSA IT support contract) actually added obligations rather than cut them.  
  – NPR’s tally of truly cancelled contracts and realistic savings is closer to $2 billion, with about half of that from cuts at Education, CFPB, and USAID.  
• DOGE provides no breakdown or source for the other $46.5 billion in claimed savings. White House and DOGE officials did not respond to queries.

Expert opinions  
• Christopher Byrne (retired senior contracting officer): DOGE’s tech‑savvy team lacks contracting expertise, omits key details (contract IDs, type, scope of cancellation), and misunderstands procurement processes.  
• Six anonymous current/former contracting officers: DOGE overemphasizes maximum contract values and omits how much has already been spent or is legally owed under “termination for convenience” clauses.  
• Jessica Riedl (Manhattan Institute): True contracting reform requires upfront investment in audits, systems, and controls, not “chainsaw” cuts.  
• Jessica Tillipman (GWU Law): Termination for convenience often obligates the government to pay for completed work, so “savings” may trigger additional costs.

Context & comparison  
• Official procurement databases (FPDS, USAspending.gov, SAM) provide more complete, validated data: current and historical award amounts, spending to date, and contract start/end dates.  
• NPR’s analysis suggests DOGE’s public portrayal is misleading and that its methodology overstates savings by billions.

**US Government Cancels Over 400 Diversity and Equality Programs Worth Over $200 Million**
The US government has canceled over 400 diversity and equality programs (DEI) worth more than $200 million, according to the US Government Efficiency Department (DOGE). The department announced that the National Science Foundation had successfully executed a project to cancel 402 DEI grants, saving the government $233 million. The DOGE, established by President Donald Trump, aims to reduce government waste by cutting unnecessary expenses and restructuring federal agencies and institutions. In a previous statement, US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said that the department had uncovered shocking government waste without congressional approval. In February, the DOGE announced that it had saved $55 billion through cost-cutting measures, including streamlining government spending in various sectors. According to the department's report, this savings was achieved through a variety of activities and measures, including reducing federal workforce, renegotiating lease and contract agreements, selling underutilized assets, canceling unnecessary grants, and taking steps to find administrative efficiencies and modify some government programs to align with current priorities.

**Maryland's government efficiency initiative faces scrutiny as progress seems stalled**
Maryland's government modernization initiative, led by Governor Wes Moore, aims to cut costs and improve efficiency in the state government. Critics, including David Williams of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, question the progress of the plan, which was announced in January 2025. Williams said, 'This is about efficiency and it's also about saving money.' Despite the initiative's promise to save Marylanders $50 million, no tangible results have been shown three months after its announcement. Williams emphasized the potential benefits for taxpayers, saying, 'This was a real opportunity for the taxpayers of Maryland...to make the government more efficient.' The governor's office has not provided answers to questions regarding the progress of the waste-cutting efforts. 'People want a more efficient government and this could be accomplished if the governor follows through on the DOGE,' Williams said.

**DOGE Tells HHS Not to Pay Its Bills**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has implemented a new policy called 'Defend the Spend' at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is causing delays in payments to tens of thousands of organizations. According to 12 people familiar with the new arrangements, the policy requires manual review and approval of previously routine payments, resulting in a backlog of payments, including funding for doctors' and nurses' salaries at federal health centers for the poor. As one employee noted, 'It's a fine way to slow down or stop legally obligatory spending while unknown bureaucrats take their time reviewing 'justifications,' then tout anything not spent as 'savings.' This approach is seen as a prototype for a broader effort to disrupt disfavored agencies and deny them the use of congressionally authorized and appropriated funds.

**Elon Musk's DOGE shaves off nearly $1 billion in 'savings' overnight, internet left chasing receipts**
Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has removed nearly $1 billion in claimed savings from its website, sparking controversy and raising concerns about accountability and transparency. The sudden deletion of the figures, which were previously touted as a fiscal revolution, has led to skepticism and criticism over unverifiable numbers and opaque accounting. Despite the White House standing by the agency, watchdogs and skeptics are questioning the true impact of Musk's cost-cutting crusade, with some calling it the 'most expensive magic trick in government history.' As the DOGE story continues to unfold, the question remains: are these savings real, or is this just a PR stunt?

**US Government Halts Automatic Grant Payments, Causing Delays**
The US Department of Efficiency of Government (DOGE) has temporarily stopped automatic federal grant payments, introducing a mandatory manual review of each payment. This has led to delays in disbursing funds to tens of thousands of organizations, including centers for the poor. 'DOGE is introducing new restrictions on grant payments, requiring manual review of previously routine transactions, which has paralyzed the distribution of funds,' The Washington Post reports. The Defend the Spend program aims to increase transparency, but has caused delays in payments, including those for doctors' salaries in clinics for uninsured patients. 'Some organizations are waiting for payments that were supposed to arrive last week,' the newspaper notes. This move comes after The Wall Street Journal reported that US government spending has increased by $154 billion since Donald Trump took office, compared to the same period in 2024 under Joe Biden's presidency, despite DOGE's efforts. Additionally, the US State Department has canceled foreign grants worth $215 million.

**DOGE begins to freeze health-care payments for extra review**
The U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has implemented a new initiative called 'Defend the Spend' to manually review and approve federal health-care grants, which has caused a backlog of payments to tens of thousands of organizations. The effort, which aims to create transparency and justify spending, has left thousands of payments backed up, including funding for doctors' and nurses' salaries at federal health centers for the poor. According to 12 people familiar with the new arrangements, the process has been abruptly instituted at the National Institutes for Health, the Administration for Children and Families, and other parts of the Department of Health and Human Services. 'The era of rubber stamping is over,' said an HHS statement. However, current and former federal officials said the process would create bottlenecks and 'strangle grantees with red tape.' Robert Gordon, who served as the HHS assistant secretary of financial resources during the Biden administration, said, 'Instead of cutting red tape, they are strangling grantees with it.' It is unclear whether all the federal health-care grants will be approved and when. 'All funding is on hold,' an NIH official told colleagues at a meeting on Thursday, according to audio obtained by The Post. 'The bottom line is no one is getting any money right now. But they don't know they're not getting any money because it just says that it's 'in transit.''

**Some regional food banks struggle with federal program cuts**
The recent federal program cuts have impacted larger regional food banks, but smaller operations like the Victoria Church of the Nazarene's food pantry have not been affected. The Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provided $500 million annually to food banks, was eliminated as part of the federal Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) cost-cutting measures. FACES, a regional food bank, has been severely impacted, serving 2,455 people in 2024 and distributing 400,000 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables. The group's co-presidents, Paul and Joanna Baker, stated that the cuts have made it difficult to provide fresh produce to those in need, particularly for those with chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. FACES is now asking local governments, businesses, and residents for help to avoid making cuts of their own. The group has also been part of the national Healthy Pantry Initiative, which aims to provide healthier food to address chronic diseases. Paul Baker said, 'The fresh produce we received from the Southside Virginia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association as a result of the USDA grant was a major boon in our efforts to achieve the goals of the healthy pantry initiative.' Virginia senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine have written a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, urging her to reverse the decision to cancel the program. Anyone wanting to help FACES can donate or volunteer through their website.

**April 10, 2025: DOGE Highlights * WorldNetDaily * by WND Staff**
Elon Musk announced that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has identified $150 billion in potential federal budget savings for FY2026, a significant reduction from his earlier $1 trillion projection. The DOGE has found major cuts in the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and the General Services Administration. However, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has instructed employees to disregard weekly productivity emails mandated by DOGE, signaling resistance to Musk's directives. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is collaborating with DOGE staff to review agency contracts and workforce structures. 'This move reflects growing pushback from federal agencies against DOGE's aggressive efficiency measures,' according to the article.

**Negotiations to avert a shutdown sputter as disputes persist over DOGE cuts**
Congress is on the brink of a government shutdown as negotiations over funding talks stall, with no clear path to reaching a deal. The government is set to run out of money at the end of next Friday, March 14. Republicans and Democrats are at odds over funding, with Democrats pushing for constraints on President Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's attempts to close down or slash agencies without congressional approval. Republicans, however, support the Department of Government Efficiency-led budget cuts, which they say is about rooting out waste. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Democrats have to help negotiate this, but they've shown no interest in finding a reasonable solution. The White House has requested add-ons to the bill, including $32 billion in transfer authority for the Pentagon and a $20 billion cut to Internal Revenue Service enforcement. Democrats are opposed to these requests, with Sen. Patty Murray saying they are 'completely inadequate.' Sen. Susan Collins is working on a two-track approach, including a full-year continuing resolution and a short-term bill to give more time for a detailed agreement.

**DOGE's BPA Contracts: A Misunderstood Effort to Improve Efficiency**
The US Department of Efficiency (DOGE) has been criticized for its handling of 'procurement agreements' (BPA), which were mistakenly labeled as 'contracts' and led to a 650 billion dollar savings claim being questioned. According to an investigation by NBC, the Department of Agriculture spent 25 million dollars on diversity training in 4 contracts, while the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau spent 6 billion dollars on management consultants. However, these numbers may not be as they seem. Steve Kelman, who managed and budgeted federal procurement policies in the 1990s, explained that 'this doesn't mean the government will actually buy these services, it's just a convenience for future procurement.' The investigation also found that DOGE did not actually save any money by canceling these BPA contracts. BPA agreements are the result of years of negotiation between the government and contractors, aimed at streamlining the procurement process and reducing transaction costs. Canceling BPA agreements may not lead to immediate cost savings, but could instead delay government procurement and even increase future costs. The NBC report also pointed out that DOGE's website listed over 60 BPA contracts worth over 1 billion dollars, which were mistakenly labeled as government expenditures. This misinterpretation may have exaggerated the actual amount spent by the government and given the impression of wasteful spending. The New York Times reported that DOGE recently quietly removed some of the savings projects from its website, further raising questions about the agency's transparency. The investigation also found that DOGE's claim of saving 650 billion dollars only accounts for 0.9% of the 2024 federal budget. DOGE is also facing lawsuits questioning its legitimacy and the way it operates. Despite this, government agencies will continue to use BPA to quickly obtain the services they need. As a senior employee of the federal procurement department pointed out, the process of establishing these contracts takes months, but canceling or modifying them can have a severe impact on government work. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields responded to the criticism, saying that it reflects opposition to the government's efforts to improve efficiency, rather than a mistake by DOGE. He emphasized that the government's reform efforts are in line with President Trump's mission and will not be swayed by misinformation from traditional media.

**Dozens of DOGE ‘receipts' saved no money and killed contracts meant to boost efficiency**
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been accused of exaggerating its claims of cutting government waste. An investigation by NBC News found that many of the 'receipts' listed on DOGE's 'wall of savings' are actually negotiated agreements with government contractors, known as blanket purchase agreements (BPAs), which do not necessarily result in immediate savings. In fact, canceling BPAs does not prevent future spending, and agencies could still spend money on the services or goods listed in the agreements. The findings add to a growing list of issues with DOGE's claims, including misinterpreted data and misstated savings. As of Wednesday, DOGE's website claimed $65 billion in savings, but an Associated Press analysis found that 40% of contracts cut by DOGE are not expected to save the government any money. The agency is also embroiled in lawsuits questioning its legality and is facing questions about its operation and leadership. 'This is a way to make it easier for the government to order, if it does order, and to set up good prices that they can order. It doesn’t mean they buy it,' said Steve Kelman, who ran the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in the 1990s. 'The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,' said Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman. 'It took a long time to build all that stuff up and mere minutes or hours for all of that to come burning to the ground,' said a current senior employee working in procurement for the federal government. 'The agency used one of the BPAs in 2023 to order — or “call” on the BPA in government jargon — and approve $414,892 in diversity trainings. Much of the money has already been spent, but DOGE’s cancellation prevents $121,770 from being spent,' according to federal records.

**Trump Praises Musk's Efforts to Reduce Government Spending**
US President Donald Trump expressed his desire for Elon Musk to continue his efforts to reduce government spending, saying 'Elon is doing a great job, but I want him to be bolder... We have a country to save.' Trump appointed Musk as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency to reduce government spending. The Department of Government Efficiency announced that $55 billion has been saved through cost-cutting measures. The department has been auditing federal agencies since Trump's second term began last month, and Musk was tasked with eliminating waste in a unprecedented government reform that includes a comprehensive section of thousands of employees. The department praised the current estimate, which was launched on the department's website on Monday, saying it represents a mix of fraud detection, deletion, contract cancellation, lease cancellation, contract renegotiation, asset sales, grant cancellation, workforce reduction, software changes, and organizational savings. This step is part of the government reform efforts launched by the administration since the beginning of Trump's second term last month. Elon Musk was also appointed as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency to eliminate government waste and improve government performance. This government reform is characterized by tough measures that include firing thousands of government employees. The Department of Government Efficiency announced that the public-facing website will be updated twice a week, allowing for real-time reports on progress made in reducing costs and improving government efficiency, according to the New York Post. The revamped website features a 'dashboard' that displays hundreds of government contracts and other expenses in detail, as well as the savings achieved by the Department of Energy and Natural Resources. These savings include reductions in government subscriptions to news platforms. The basis of the Department of Government Efficiency's estimate of $55 billion has not been clarified. In the 2024 fiscal year, which ended on September 30 last year, the total federal budget was approximately $6.75 trillion, with a budget deficit of around $1.8 trillion. Mathematicians at the Department of Government Efficiency claim to have saved taxpayers around $55 billion through a series of cost-cutting measures since Trump took office last month. Wide-ranging cuts in federal agencies to eliminate waste and abuse. These measures include wide-ranging cuts in federal agencies to eliminate waste and abuse. Elon Musk points out that these cuts have resulted in a savings of $55 billion. The Department of Government Efficiency praised the estimate, which reaches $55 billion, when launching its public-facing website. This number represents a mix of several factors, including fraud detection, deletion, contract cancellation, lease cancellation, contract renegotiation, asset sales, grant cancellation, workforce reduction, software changes, and organizational savings.'

The Department of Governmental Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) has made significant accomplishments in its first three weeks, saving the US government over $350 billion, according to the Epoch Times. This success has been met with opposition from D.C. bureaucrats, Democrats, and Republicans, who are 'weeping and gnashing of teeth' according to the article. The author praises D.O.G.E.'s achievements, comparing them to President Trump and Elon Musk's goals, and hopes that the department will continue to 'remove the scourge of the Washington D.C. venality and corruption.' The article concludes with a quote from Ronald Reagan, 'that shining city on a hill' should regain its former glory for the sake of future generations.

**What We Know About Pentagon Cuts -- As Hegseth Directs Sweeping Reductions**
The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk's cost-saving efforts, has begun working with the Department of Defense, sparking questions about the Pentagon's budget. According to a memo obtained by The Washington Post, Pentagon chief Kashyap ' Kash' Hegseth plans to reduce unnecessary defense spending and drive reform, including progress on the audit. The memo outlines 17 categories exempt from budget cuts, including operations at the southern U.S. border and modernizing nuclear weapons. If the proposed 8% annual cuts happen, it would be the largest effort to reduce spending in the department in more than a decade. Hegseth has welcomed Musk and DOGE to the Pentagon to improve efficiency, saying 'there are waste, redundancies and head counts in headquarters that need to be addressed.' The Defense Department's budget for fiscal year 2025 is around $850 billion, with one-sixth of federal spending going towards national defense. Musk's agency has saved the government $55 billion through cost-cutting measures, but DOGE's actions are facing criticism and legal challenges.

**Doge's Cost-Cutting Claims Under Scrutiny**
The US government's efforts to cut costs with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) claim to have saved $55 billion in federal spending so far, but the agency's website only details $16.6 billion of that total. The figure does not account for an error in the data published on the website that incorrectly classified a contract as being worth $8 billion, when in fact, as later corrected in the government's database, the value was only $8 million. This reduces the total savings cited by the Doge, including contracts and rentals, to around $8.6 billion, nearly half of the initial claim.
