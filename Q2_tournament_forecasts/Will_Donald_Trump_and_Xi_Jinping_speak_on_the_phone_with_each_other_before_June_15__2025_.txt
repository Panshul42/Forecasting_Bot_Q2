Analysis:
This question hinges on the precedent and frequency of phone contacts between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, both during Trump’s presidency and afterward, as well as any similar contacts between Xi and former U.S. presidents. Key historical context needed includes:
- A complete list of all publicly acknowledged Xi–Trump phone calls from 2017–2021.
- Evidence of Xi Jinping ever phoning ex-U.S. presidents (e.g., Obama, Bush) post-term.
- Any attempts or denials from either side about calls since January 2021.
Understanding these will establish a base-rate for such communications and inform how plausible a call before June 15, 2025, is given current diplomatic norms.

Analysis:
We need up‐to‐date reporting on whether Beijing or Trump’s team is arranging direct contact, any signals from Chinese foreign ministry briefings, Trump campaign or Post‐Presidential Office statements, and commentary from experts tracking US–China high-level engagement. Key areas:
- Official Chinese statements (Ministry of Foreign Affairs daily briefings) on dialogue with Trump
- Trump’s public remarks or campaign/office communications about outreach to Xi
- Reporting in both US and Chinese media on any scheduled or tentative calls
- Expert commentary on likelihood of phone diplomacy under a possible 2025 Trump presidency

Gathering these will allow us to adjust from a base‐rate of rare ex-prez–incumbent head calls to an inside‐view estimate based on current diplomatic signaling.

<Summary source="https://www.axios.com/2021/01/19/trump-china-policy-special-report">
Here’s a focused summary of the Axios report “How U.S. policy toward China transformed under Trump” (Jan. 19, 2021; Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian):

1. Overview  
- Trump launched the trade war on Day 1 of his presidency, fulfilling campaign promises.  
- By mid-2020, his aides largely drove China policy as Trump shifted focus to domestic issues.  
- The trade war “shattered global norms,” enabling tougher measures that earlier administrations would have shunned.

2. Timeline of key developments  
- Late 2016: President-elect Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen (first such U.S.-Taiwan contact since 1979) signaled a break with past diplomatic restraint.  
- 2017: Trump imposes tariffs on billions in Chinese goods, sparking a protracted trade war.  
- Early 2018: Adoption of an Indo-Pacific framework; U.S. Pacific Command renamed Indo-Pacific Command; DOJ launches the “China Initiative” to counter espionage and covert activities.  
- 2019: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo publicly accuses the Chinese Communist Party of seeking “international domination.” However, Trump’s pursuit of a trade deal limits some sanctions on Chinese officials for human-rights abuses.  
- 2020:  
  • Phase One trade deal signed (January).  
  • COVID-19 outbreak prompts Trump to label it the “China virus,” fueling anti-Asian racism.  
  • With Trump mostly absent from China policy, his national-security team and Pompeo push through a flood of new measures.

3. “Whole-of-government” activity in 2020  
- At least 210 public actions related to China across 10+ agencies:  
  • 60 by State (visa restrictions, advisories, diplomatic measures)  
  • 27 by the White House (executive orders, the Phase One deal)  
  • 24 by Treasury (sanctions)  
  • 23 by Defense (naval transits, public reports)  
  • 22 by DOJ (indictments, arrests)  
  • 16 by DHS (forced-labor import bans, reports)  
  • 13 by Commerce (export controls, entity-list additions)  
  • FCC labels Huawei and ZTE national-security threats; smaller numbers of actions by USTR, Energy, Ex-Im Bank, Agriculture, NSA, Education, Labor.  
- Sanctions: 90 Chinese entities/individuals in 2020, accounting for 11.5% of all U.S. sanctions designations (Center for a New American Security data).

4. Criticisms and consequences  
- Some measures—e.g., curbs on Chinese journalists, U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization—have drawn domestic and international criticism as counterproductive or contrary to U.S. values.  
- The sheer volume of new policies leaves the incoming Biden administration with a major workload to assess and adjust.

5. Voices from inside  
- A “senior administration official with knowledge of the Trump administration’s China strategy” argued that China’s coercive economic practices demanded “extreme” actions. Quoted:  
  • “The U.S. had to step out in front and take some actions that were perceived as extreme. It’s not establishment Washington thinking.”  
  • “I think we were proved to be correct in many ways. You can impose economic costs on China without the world falling apart. … China has been extremely restrained in its retaliation.”  
  • “I think this is good momentum for the next team to come in.”

Summary of “Xi and Trump Speak Via Phone”  
Source: Carl Minzner, Council on Foreign Relations blog (January 17, 2025)

1. Facts, statistics, and objective details  
• Date and context of call  
  – On Friday, January 17, 2025, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump held a direct telephone call.  
  – This was their first direct contact since Trump left office in 2021; since the November 2024 election they had communicated only via intermediaries.  
• Content of the call (per two official readouts)  
  – Trump’s Truth Social post: discussed “balancing trade, fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects.”  
  – Chinese government statement: discussed Taiwan, trade, Ukraine, and the Israel-Palestinian conflict; Xi stressed respecting each other’s “core interests,” highlighting Taiwan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity; Trump “expressed the interest in meeting with Xi in person as soon as possible.”  
• Inauguration representation  
  – China announced that Vice President Han Zheng will attend Trump’s inauguration as Xi’s personal representative—the first time a top Chinese leader will attend a U.S. presidential inauguration.

2. Opinions from reliable, named sources  
• Donald Trump (via Truth Social): framed the call as friendly and productive, listing trade, fentanyl, and TikTok among topics.  
• Chinese government statement: described the call as “friendly and productive,” detailed substantive issues discussed, and emphasized mutual respect for core interests.

3. Potentially useful opinions from less reliable or not-named sources  
• Carl Minzner (blog author and CFR fellow): observes that compared with 2016, Trump and Xi now appear to signal warmer personal relations—contrasting January 2017’s substantive call with 2016’s more perfunctory pleasantries and Trump’s December 2016 call with Taiwan’s president.

Here’s a concise summary of the PBS News article “Trump’s inauguration will be the first in U.S. history to be attended by foreign leaders” (Jan. 19, 2025):

• Historical first: No sitting or incoming U.S. president-elect has ever formally hosted foreign heads of state at an inauguration. President-elect Trump invited a slate of foreign leaders to Washington for his Jan. 20, 2025, swearing-in.

• China:  
  – Trump publicly invited President Xi Jinping; China’s foreign ministry announced Xi will instead dispatch Vice President Han Zheng as his representative.  
  – The move comes amid rising U.S.–China tensions and a Trump cabinet featuring several “China hawks” (e.g., Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for State).  
  – Trump and Xi spoke by phone on the Friday before the article’s publication, discussing trade, fentanyl and TikTok; Trump called it “a very good one.”  
  – During that call, Xi urged Trump to handle the Taiwan issue “with prudence,” citing China’s sovereignty concerns.

• Other invited or attending leaders:  
  – Argentina’s Javier Milei (self-described “anarcho-capitalist”), first foreign visitor to Mar-a-Lago after the Nov. 5 election. Attended inaugural balls; praised by Elon Musk for austerity measures.  
  – Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni, slated to attend the ceremony; seen as a natural Trump ally and European interlocutor.  
  – Former Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, guest of Rep. Joe Wilson, speaking out on Georgia’s recent political unrest and Russian influence.  
  – Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa and Paraguay’s Santiago Peña have confirmed they’ll attend.  
  – Taiwan sent Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu and seven delegates; they will meet U.S. officials and scholars but will not attend the indoor swearing-in ceremony.  
  – France: President Macron will not attend, but far-right figures Éric Zemmour (pundit-turned-politician) and Marion Maréchal (MEP) plan to go.

<Summary source="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/trump-xi-china-tariffs">
Disclaimer: Summary is based solely on the CNN article “Trump is waiting for Xi to call. The Chinese see it differently” (April 10, 2025).

Key facts and figures  
• The White House granted a 90-day tariff reprieve to dozens of countries—China was excluded.  
• President Trump raised U.S. tariffs on all Chinese goods by 145%.  
• China retaliated with 125% tariffs on U.S. imports.  

U.S.–China phone-call standoff  
• U.S. officials warned Chinese counterparts hours before Beijing’s tariff hike and again made clear that President Xi Jinping should request a leader-level phone call.  
• Two senior White House officials say the U.S. will not initiate a call; Trump has told aides that China must “make the first move,” a stance communicated to Beijing for about two months.  
• Three sources familiar with the communications say China has repeatedly refused to arrange a direct Xi-Trump call—reportedly unwilling to appear weak by requesting talks.  

Communication channels  
• Working-level channels remain active, but no high-level dialogue has occurred; three sources briefed on the situation describe unofficial back channels as unproductive.  
• Beijing sought to use Foreign Minister Wang Yi as an interlocutor; the Trump team rejected this, doubting Wang’s closeness to Xi. China would not agree to alternate U.S.-proposed envoys.  
• China’s readout of an earlier Wang–Senator Marco Rubio call was disputed by Rubio, who said the purported warning “didn’t happen… at least not on the call.”  
• Two senior U.S. officials say Trump would welcome sub–leader-level discussions if they yield results, though publicly National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett (on CNBC) stressed that Trump “will decide” when talks begin.  

Chinese stance  
• A Commerce Ministry spokesperson told CNN: “The door to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and equality. If the U.S. chooses confrontation, China will respond in kind. Pressure, threats, and blackmail are not the right ways to deal with China.”  

Broader U.S. strategy  
• The White House is pursuing trade deals with Japan, South Korea and Vietnam to increase pressure on Beijing (senior White House official).  
• U.S. and former officials are exploring a surprise preparatory channel for a Xi-Trump call but caution against ambushing Xi, citing Ukrainian President Zelensky’s Oval Office visit.  
• Danny Russel, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia: China insists on groundwork and agreed-upon rules before a summit-level call.  

Intermediaries and other pressures  
• China tried reaching Trump through business leaders—e.g., Elon Musk met Vice President Han Zheng when he attended Trump’s inauguration—but these efforts “haven’t been fruitful” (one source).  
• Beijing considered sanctions on U.S. companies such as Apple, Tesla, Caterpillar and Starbucks but backed off, fearing consumer backlash and loss of CCP backchannels. Instead, China may shift soybean and agricultural purchases to Brazil, as it did in the first Trump trade war (two sources).

1. Facts and figures  
- Trump says he struck a $50 billion agriculture-purchase deal with Xi during his first term’s tariff talks.  
- He claims China “is not living up to it.”  
- He vows his first Oval Office call would be to Xi, demanding China honor the $50 billion farm-goods purchase.  
- He would instruct Xi to impose the death penalty on fentanyl dealers in China.  
- He would impose a 200% tariff on John Deere exports to the U.S. if the company moves manufacturing to Mexico.

2. Direct statements by Trump (primary source)  
- “My first call—I’m going to call up President Xi. I’m going to say, ‘you have to honor the deal you made.’ … You’d buy $50 billion worth of American farm product, and I guarantee you he will buy it, 100% he will buy it.”  
- “Second thing I’m going to do is I’m going to say, ‘you have to give the death penalty to your fentanyl dealers who are sending fentanyl.’”  
- Warning to John Deere: if manufacturing shifts to Mexico, “we’re putting a 200% tariff on everything that you want to sell into the United States.”

3. Context and policy positions  
- At a Pennsylvania farmers’ roundtable—part of his swing-state campaigning—Trump contrasted his China stance with the Harris-Biden administration.  
- He also stumped for Republican Senate hopeful David McCormick against Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.).  
- He reiterated opposition to Chinese purchases of U.S. farmland, support for repealing the estate tax, and protection of fracking.

4. Opinions from roundtable attendees (named but local/regional sources)  
- Darrell Becker, president of the Fayette County Farm Bureau: “The U.S. can’t afford to ignore China—they’re our biggest threat … and they want to replace us.”  
- Eric Davanzo, Pennsylvania state representative (58th district): “Absolutely … it should be [Trump’s] first phone call,” warning that U.S.–China relations risk becoming a “forest fire.”

# Timeline and Context of Publicly Acknowledged Phone Calls Between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump  

The diplomatic interactions between Chinese President Xi Jinping and former U.S. President Donald Trump have spanned periods of cooperation, tension, and conflicting accounts. This report synthesizes verified communications, contested claims, and broader geopolitical context surrounding their engagements, including post-presidency interactions.  

---

## Confirmed Direct Communications Between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump  

### February 9, 2017: Reaffirmation of the "One China" Policy  
The first confirmed post-election call occurred shortly after Trump’s 2016 victory. During this exchange, Trump agreed to uphold the U.S. commitment to the "One China" policy, reversing his earlier suggestion that the policy was negotiable[4][6]. The Chinese readout emphasized Xi’s focus on mutual respect and cooperation, while the White House highlighted Trump’s willingness to honor longstanding diplomatic norms ahead of formal negotiations on trade and security[4][6]. This call set the tone for subsequent engagements, balancing Trump’s transactional approach with Xi’s emphasis on structural bilateral stability.  

### January 17, 2025: Pre-Inauguration Dialogue on Key Issues  
In the lead-up to Trump’s second inauguration, Xi initiated a call to congratulate Trump on his electoral victory and discuss pressing bilateral matters[1][10][15][17]. According to Chinese state media, Xi stressed the importance of respecting China’s “core interests,” particularly regarding Taiwan, while Trump highlighted trade imbalances, fentanyl trafficking, and the fate of TikTok[1][10][16]. The U.S. readout framed the conversation as a precursor to in-person meetings, with Trump expressing eagerness to host Xi[15]. This call marked a contrast to their 2017 interactions, reflecting Trump’s renewed focus on economic leverage and Xi’s prioritization of sovereignty issues[10][16].  

---

## Contested and Unverified Claims of Post-Presidency Contact  

### April 2025: Disputed Claims of Tariff Negotiations  
Trump asserted in an April 25, 2025, interview with *Time* magazine that Xi had contacted him to discuss reducing tariffs, which had escalated to 145% on Chinese goods and 125% on U.S. imports[5][9][14]. However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun categorically denied any recent communication between the leaders, stating, “To my knowledge, there has been no phone call between the two heads of state recently”[2][9][14]. This contradiction underscores the fragility of U.S.-China dialogue amid trade hostilities, with Beijing refusing to acknowledge negotiations under pressure[2][14].  

---

## Xi Jinping’s Communications with Other U.S. Presidents  

### Engagement with Sitting U.S. Presidents  
Xi’s diplomatic engagements have primarily involved sitting U.S. presidents rather than former leaders. Notable examples include:  
- **Barack Obama (2013–2017):** Regular calls addressed issues such as cybersecurity, climate change, and North Korea[12].  
- **Joe Biden (2021–2025):** Post-2023 interactions focused on military de-escalation, fentanyl controls, and economic competition[11].  

### Absence of Contact with Former U.S. Presidents  
No publicly available evidence suggests Xi has initiated contact with former U.S. presidents after their terms ended. This pattern aligns with China’s preference for engaging current administrations to influence active policy[12][13]. For instance, during Hillary Clinton’s 2012 visit as Secretary of State, a scheduled meeting with Xi (then Vice President) was canceled abruptly, reflecting Beijing’s selective diplomatic prioritization[13].  

---

## Analysis of Diplomatic Patterns and Discrepancies  

### Strategic Use of Direct Communication  
The confirmed 2017 and 2025 calls reveal Xi’s consistent emphasis on Taiwan as a non-negotiable issue, whereas Trump’s focus shifted from ideological flexibility (e.g., the 2017 “One China” reversal) to economic bargaining in his second term[4][10][16]. The 2025 pre-inauguration dialogue also highlighted TikTok’s geopolitical significance, with Trump seeking to leverage its U.S. operations amid bipartisan security concerns[15][17].  

### Contradictions in Post-2025 Claims  
The April 2025 denial of communication by China likely reflects a strategic refusal to legitimize Trump’s tariff threats. By rejecting Trump’s narrative, Beijing aimed to avoid signaling desperation amid economic strain, a tactic consistent with its handling of past trade disputes[2][9][14].  

---

## Conclusion  

The documented calls between Xi and Trump underscore the interplay of personal diplomacy and structural tensions in U.S.-China relations. While their 2017 and 2025 interactions established frameworks for managing competition, unresolved disputes over Taiwan, trade, and technology persist. The absence of post-presidency contact with other U.S. leaders reinforces Beijing’s focus on incumbent administrations as primary channels for influence. Future bilateral stability will depend on reconciling competing narratives and aligning strategic priorities.

1. Facts and Objective Details
   • China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on April 28 that President Xi Jinping and Donald Trump “have not called each other recently,” and that their governments “have not conducted consultations or negotiations on the tariffs issue.”  
   • In a Time magazine interview published April 25, Trump claimed he was “talking with China to reach a tariff deal” and that Xi had called him. Beijing has repeatedly denied those talks are taking place.

2. Opinions from Reliable, Named Sources
   • Guo Jiakun: “If the U.S. really wants to solve the problem through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop threatening and blackmailing [China].”  
   • Beijing has accused Washington of “misleading the public” by suggesting talks are underway.

3. Contextual Notes
   • Chinese policymakers sought to downplay the impact of U.S. tariffs on China’s growth to reassure markets about its fragile economic recovery.

• In a Time magazine interview published April 25, President Donald Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping “called” him, though Trump gave no details on when the call took place or what was discussed. Trump added he would not initiate such a call himself.  
• Beijing has “disputed” the U.S. characterization of ongoing tariff talks. China’s Foreign Ministry (and its Washington embassy) has urged Washington to stop “misleading the public” on bilateral negotiations.  
• Trump said his administration has struck 200 “tariff deals” and expects to conclude negotiations with China in three to four weeks. He likened the U.S. to a “department store” setting prices and described any continuation of 50% tariffs after a year as “total victory.”  
• On other foreign-policy fronts:  
  – Ukraine/Russia: Trump seeks a quick end to the war, has floated a proposal with Europeans/Ukrainians, and sent special envoy Steve Witkoff to meet Vladimir Putin. He said Crimea “will stay with Russia.”  
  – Middle East: He predicts Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords and expects a U.S. deal with Iran, saying he’d be open to meeting Iran’s Supreme Leader or president. He plans to visit Saudi Arabia next month.  
• Domestically, Trump defended using presidential power to revoke student visas, target law firms and immigration cases (including the Tufts student Rumeysa Öztürk), and to go after former Cybersecurity Agency head Chris Krebs.

<Summary source="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3297656/why-chinese-president-xi-jinping-wont-just-hop-call-donald-trump">
Here’s a concise summary of the South China Morning Post article “Why China’s leader won’t just ‘hop on a call’ with Trump” (Feb. 6, 2025):

• The ongoing uncertainty over if—and when—Xi Jinping and Donald Trump might speak by phone reflects not only their differing worldviews but also deliberate caution on Beijing’s part.  
• Diplomatic observers say Beijing’s reluctance to “just hop on a call” suggests it wants to carefully control the timing and format of any direct conversation, using it as a signal of China’s stance toward Trump.  
• Pang Zhongying (visiting senior fellow, ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute) argues that Trump’s penchant for spontaneous phone diplomacy doesn’t mesh with Chinese protocol. He notes:  
  – Trump has boasted he could resolve big conflicts (e.g. ending the Ukraine war in a day), but for China “holding a phone call is not that simple.”  
  – It’s uncommon for China’s top leader to “pick up the phone … to resolve issues”; China prefers more formal, pre-arranged channels.  
• In Pang’s view, the “Chinese way” of managing high-level talks is fundamentally different from Trump’s more off-the-cuff style.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Axios (2021):** Historical overview of Trump's first-term China policy, detailing the aggressive shift in approach. Contains factual data about tariffs and policy actions. Quality is high for historical context but outdated for current relations.

2. **CFR Blog (Jan 2025):** High-quality source describing the January 17, 2025 Xi-Trump phone call. Provides both factual information from official readouts and analysis from Carl Minzner (a China expert). Clear distinction between facts (call content) and expert opinion (comparison to 2016 relations).

3. **Straight Arrow News (Jan 2025):** Factual reporting on the January phone call. Primarily reiterates information from official statements and Truth Social posts. Medium-quality source that aligns with other reporting.

4. **PBS News (Jan 2025):** High-quality reporting on Trump's inauguration and foreign representation. Factual information about the January call and Chinese Vice President Han's attendance rather than Xi himself.

5. **CNN (April 2025):** Medium-high quality reporting on the Xi-Trump communication standoff. Contains factual data about tariff levels and diplomatic communications. Includes attributed statements from officials on both sides. Key facts: Trump is refusing to initiate a call, and China is refusing to "make the first move."

6. **NY Post (Sept 2024):** Pre-election campaign reporting of limited relevance. Contains Trump's statements about calling Xi on his first day in office, but represents campaign rhetoric rather than actual events.

7. **Perplexity Report:** Synthesizes information on Xi-Trump communications, noting confirmed calls and contradictory claims. Factually states that in April 2025, Trump claimed Xi called him while China denied this occurred. Also notes the absence of evidence that Xi has contacted former U.S. presidents after their terms.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

1. **Xi-Trump communication patterns (2025):** The most relevant reference class is their recent interaction pattern. They spoke in January 2025, but by April a standoff had developed where Trump insists Xi must call first, while China refuses to appear submissive.

2. **U.S.-China trade dispute communications:** During high-tariff periods, direct leader communication has historically occurred to resolve tensions. This is somewhat applicable as current tariffs are extremely high (145% on Chinese goods, 125% on U.S. imports).

3. **Early presidential term communications:** Typically, U.S. presidents and Chinese leaders establish regular communication channels early in new terms. This reference class is less applicable given the unique standoff that has developed.

The most suitable reference class is the current Xi-Trump diplomatic standoff combined with historical patterns during trade disputes, as the specific "waiting game" dynamic creates a distinct situation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window spans May 7 to June 15, 2025—approximately 39 days.

Key timeline points:
- January 17, 2025: Confirmed phone call between Xi and Trump
- April 10, 2025: CNN reports diplomatic standoff over who should initiate contact
- Late April 2025: Trump claims Xi called him; China officially denies this occurred

The standoff has existed for at least one month despite escalating tariffs. With just 39 days remaining, we must assess whether economic pressure will outweigh face-saving considerations within this relatively short timeframe.

## (d) Justification

Multiple factors influence the likelihood of a Xi-Trump call in this timeframe:

1. **Diplomatic Impasse:** Trump has explicitly communicated to Chinese officials for about two months that Xi must "make the first move." Chinese officials have repeatedly refused to arrange a direct call to avoid appearing weak.

2. **Failed Intermediaries:** China's attempts to use Foreign Minister Wang Yi and business leaders like Elon Musk as intermediaries have been unproductive, suggesting the standoff is entrenched.

3. **Economic Pressure:** Extremely high mutual tariffs (145% on Chinese goods, 125% on U.S. imports) create economic incentives to resume dialogue, but haven't yet broken the impasse after at least a month.

4. **Face-Saving Considerations:** China's sensitivity about appearing to cave to pressure presents a significant barrier, requiring some form of mutually agreeable diplomatic framework that doesn't yet exist.

5. **Working-Level Channels:** While leader-level communications are frozen, working-level channels remain active, potentially creating pathways to eventually facilitate a call, though these haven't proven fruitful yet.

6. **Historical Precedent:** During Trump's first term, communication channels remained open despite trade tensions, suggesting pragmatism could eventually override posturing—but this may require more time than the forecast window allows.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I must assess whether a Trump-Xi call is more or less likely than not within this 39-day window. The evidence suggests significant barriers:

1. The standoff has already persisted for at least a month with hardening positions rather than compromise
2. China's unwillingness to appear weak by initiating contact represents a significant cultural and political barrier
3. Failed intermediary attempts show the difficulty in bridging this gap
4. Working-level channels haven't yet yielded a breakthrough

Counterbalancing these factors are the economic pressures from extremely high tariffs (145%/125%) that harm both economies. However, these pressures appear insufficient thus far to override status and face-saving considerations.

The CNN article suggests both sides are doubling down rather than seeking compromise, with the U.S. pursuing alternative trade deals to pressure China and China considering shifting agricultural purchases to Brazil rather than yielding.

Given the short 39-day timeframe and the entrenched nature of the standoff, the probability appears significantly below 50%. The economic pressures and multiple communication channels keep the possibility alive, but the diplomatic barriers appear substantial.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Axios (2021)**: Provides historical context of Trump's first-term China policy characterized by trade war and growing tensions. This is useful background but less directly relevant to current dynamics. Factual reporting with some quoted opinions from an unnamed "senior administration official."

2. **CFR Blog (Jan 17, 2025)**: Reports on a phone call between Xi and President-elect Trump discussing trade, fentanyl, TikTok, Taiwan, and other issues. Factual reporting of the call content with clear distinction between official readouts and the author's limited analysis.

3. **Straight Arrow News (Jan 17, 2025)**: Reports on the same January 2025 call, confirming China sent VP Han Zheng to Trump's inauguration. Primarily factual reporting.

4. **PBS News (Jan 19, 2025)**: Provides broader context about Trump's inauguration and foreign attendees, confirming Xi did not attend despite being invited, sending VP Han instead. Factual reporting about diplomatic arrangements.

5. **CNN (April 10, 2025)**: Describes a current standoff with Trump waiting for Xi to initiate a call while China refuses to arrange direct contact to avoid appearing weak. Reports 145% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and 125% Chinese retaliatory tariffs. Contains factual reporting alongside expert analysis from Danny Russel (former assistant secretary of state) and anonymous but specified officials.

6. **NY Post (Sept 23, 2024)**: Campaign-era reporting of Trump's statement that his first call as president would be to Xi. Contains direct quotes from Trump (primary source) and opinions from named local sources at a Pennsylvania event.

7. **Perplexity Report**: Synthesizes information about Xi-Trump communications, noting confirmed calls (Feb 2017, Jan 2025), disputed April 2025 claims, and Xi's communication patterns. Generally factual but should be treated with appropriate caution as an AI synthesis.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Potential reference classes:

1. **Previous Xi-Trump direct communications (2017-2021, 2025)**: Includes their established communication pattern during Trump's first term and transition to second term.

2. **U.S.-China leader communications during trade disputes**: Broader historical context of communication patterns during trade tensions.

3. **Xi's communication patterns with foreign leaders during crises**: How Xi has managed communication during diplomatic standoffs.

4. **Recent (2025) Xi-Trump diplomatic standoff**: The specific current dynamic where Trump is waiting for Xi to call first.

**Most suitable reference class**: The fourth option is most relevant, as it captures the current unique standoff between these leaders. The CNN reporting from April 2025 establishes a specific pattern of mutual refusal to initiate contact that creates a different dynamic from previous periods.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

Today is May 7, 2025, and we need to forecast until June 15, 2025—a 39-day window.

Key temporal elements:
- Last confirmed direct communication: January 17, 2025 (pre-inauguration call)
- By April 10, 2025: Standoff had been ongoing for "about two months" (since approximately February)
- Current situation: No confirmed direct communication for nearly 4 months
- Disputed April 2025 call claim: Shows continued sensitivity around acknowledging communications

The standoff has persisted for at least 3 months by now, suggesting significant entrenchment of positions.

## (d) Justification:

Several factors suggest a low probability of a direct phone call occurring:

1. **Rigid Diplomatic Impasse**: Both sides have taken firm public positions—Trump insisting Xi call first, China refusing to appear subservient—making it difficult for either to back down without losing face.

2. **Duration of Standoff**: The impasse has already lasted approximately 3 months, showing significant resistance to resolution despite economic incentives.

3. **Failed Intermediary Efforts**: Multiple efforts through working-level channels, business leaders, and even Elon Musk's engagement with VP Han have been "unproductive" according to sources.

4. **Chinese Diplomatic Protocol**: As noted by Danny Russel (former assistant secretary for East Asia), China typically insists on extensive groundwork before summit-level calls.

However, some factors suggest possibility of communication:

1. **Economic Pressure**: Escalating tariffs (145% U.S., 125% China) create genuine economic pain that could eventually force pragmatic engagement.

2. **Previous Resilience**: Despite tensions during Trump's first term, communication channels remained functional.

3. **Timeframe**: The 39-day window provides time for diplomatic creativity to develop face-saving solutions.

# Outside view calibration:

The sources don't provide a precise base rate for resolving such diplomatic standoffs. However, I can observe that:

1. This specific standoff has already persisted for about 3 months without resolution, despite significant economic incentives to communicate.

2. Both leaders have strong psychological and political incentives not to back down from their public positions.

3. Previous U.S.-China tensions have eventually found resolution pathways, but typically after extended periods.

4. The working-level channels remain active but haven't yielded a breakthrough.

5. Trump has maintained his position that Xi must initiate contact for about 3 months now—a significant commitment to this stance.

Given the entrenched positions, the failed intermediary efforts, the Chinese unwillingness to appear weak by requesting talks, and Trump's insistence on Xi making the first move, the probability of a direct phone call occurring in the next 39 days appears significantly below 50%.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Axios (Jan. 2021 “How U.S. policy toward China transformed under Trump”): High‐quality journalistic reporting. Provides background on Trump’s hawkish stance and the institutionalization of tough China measures. Largely factual; few expert opinions, but those are clearly attributed.  
- CFR blog (Carl Minzner, Jan. 17, 2025): Reputable expert commentary. Reports the first direct Xi–Trump call since 2021, giving readouts from both sides. Factual details are solid; analysis is opinion but clearly labeled.  
- Straight Arrow News (Jan. 17, 2025): Lower-tier outlet but largely repeats Reuters and official readouts. Factual on the call; slants positive but conveys the basic points.  
- PBS NewsHour (Jan. 19, 2025): Public‐media outlet with rigorous standards. Describes the inauguration invitations and the Jan. 17 call. Largely factual.  
- CNN (April 10, 2025 “Trump is waiting for Xi to call. The Chinese see it differently”): High‐quality reporting. Provides a detailed account of the current standoff over who will initiate calls, with multiple on‐the‐record sources.  
- New York Post (Sept. 23, 2024): Tabloid bordering on opinion. Trump’s campaign statements there are clearly his rhetoric, not an objective forecast.  
- Perplexity report: Aggregates publicly known calls (Feb. 2017, Jan. 2025) and contested claims. Some source uncertainty, but its core timeline (two calls in eight years) matches the high‐quality outlets.

2. Reference‐class analysis  
- Calls between Xi and Trump over eight years: 2 confirmed phone calls (Feb. 2017; Jan. 17, 2025) → ~0.25 calls per year or ~2% chance per month.  
- Calls between Xi and sitting U.S. presidents (e.g., Xi–Biden): ~7 calls per year → ~0.6 calls per month. But Biden–Xi calls occur in a more conventional, less confrontational relationship than Trump–Xi.  
- Calls between Trump and other foreign leaders in 2025: Trump has sporadic high‐level outreach (e.g., Jan. 2025 inauguration invitations) but no record of frequent follow‐ups.  
Most suitable reference class: direct Xi–Trump call frequency.

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Forecast window: May 12 – June 15 2025 (~34 days).  
- Historical pattern: Since Jan. 17, 2025, no further calls; as of Apr. 10, 2025 the two sides are publicly at odds over who should initiate. In Trump’s first term, after the Feb. 2017 call there were no more publicly acknowledged Xi–Trump phone calls until his departure in Jan. 2021.

4. Justification for outside‐view probability  
- Base rate from the reference class: 2 calls in 96 months → ~2% monthly chance.  
- Current context: a public standoff over initiation lowers odds below the raw base rate. There are no major scheduled bilateral events between mid‐May and mid-June that would compel a call.  
- Trump’s declared posture (China “must make the first move”) and Beijing’s simultaneous insistence on “mutual respect” and “groundwork” make a near‐term breakthrough unlikely.  

Outside‐view calibration:  
Starting from a 2% per-month base rate, adjusted downward for the high public tension and absence of scheduled high-level triggers, I shave off 25% of that probability. That yields ~1.5%, which I round up modestly to allow for last-minute diplomatic surprises.

Outside View Prediction:
2% (±1%) chance that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will speak on the phone between May 12 and June 15, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. Axios report on Trump’s China policy (Jan. 2021)  
      – Type: Deep‐dive retrospective by a reputable news outlet.  
      – Data quality: High for historical context (tariffs, “China Initiative”), but no direct bearing on calls in 2025.  
      – Opinions vs. facts: Mostly factual; expert quotes distinguish viewpoints.  
   b. CFR blog “Xi and Trump Speak Via Phone” (Jan. 17 2025)  
      – Type: Council on Foreign Relations blog by a named fellow.  
      – Data quality: High for the January 17 call readouts (U.S. and Chinese official statements).  
      – Opinions: Carl Minzner’s “warmer personal relations” take is expert analysis, clearly labeled.  
   c. Straight Arrow News (SAN.com) “Trump holds ‘very good’ phone call…” (Jan. 17 2025)  
      – Type: Partisan news site.  
      – Data quality: Medium–high on the basic facts (call happened, topics), but editorial tone may overstate “very good.”  
      – Opinions: Trump’s and Xi’s characterizations, drawn from official statements; treat commentary with caution.  
   d. PBS News “Trump’s inauguration will be the first…” (Jan. 19 2025)  
      – Type: Public‐broadcasting news outlet.  
      – Data quality: High on factual reporting (inauguration guests, summary of the same call).  
      – Opinions: Minimal, largely factual.  
   e. CNN “Trump is waiting for Xi to call…” (Apr. 10 2025)  
      – Type: Major news organization with multiple sources.  
      – Data quality: High. Quotes from senior U.S. and Chinese officials on the current standoff.  
      – Opinions: Official statements conflict (U.S. says China is refusing; China says “door is open”).  
   f. New York Post “Trump says he’d demand Xi…” (Sept. 23 2024)  
      – Type: Tabloid with known slant.  
      – Data quality: Low–medium. Factual that Trump made those campaign statements; broader policy reliability is questionable.  
      – Opinions: Trump’s pledges and farmers’ comments—worth noting as Trump rhetoric but not reliable predictors.  
   g. Perplexity report on phone-call timeline  
      – Type: Aggregated timeline from multiple (uneven) sources.  
      – Data quality: Mixed. Good on the two confirmed calls (Feb 2017, Jan 2025), less so on contested April 2025 claims.  
      – Opinions: Minimal; mostly synthesis of reported events.

2. Reference-class analysis  
   • Calls between Xi and Donald Trump (first term):  
     – Known direct calls in February 2017 and some in 2018–2020, roughly 1–2 calls per year once relationships soured.  
   • Calls between Xi and Joe Biden:  
     – In the first 16 months of the Biden administration, Xi–Biden calls occurred roughly once per quarter (4 calls total).  
   • General leader-to-leader calls under tension:  
     – When bilateral relations are stressed (e.g., during trade wars), calls drop to 1–2 per year and are choreographed around big events.  
   Suitability: The most analogous reference class is “leader-to-leader calls during high bilateral tension,” which yields ~1.5 calls per year or 0.125 calls per month.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Window length: May 12 to June 15, 2025 → 34 days ≈ 1.1 months.  
   • Expected number of calls in this class over 1.1 months = 1.5 calls/year × (1.1/12) ≈ 0.14 calls → 14% chance of ≥1 call.  
   • Additional factors:  
     – Recent call (Jan 17, 2025) indicates willingness, but CNN (Apr 10) shows both sides publicly shifting blame, lowering the odds of a near-term sequel.  
     – No scheduled summit or multilateral event in the 34-day window to provide a natural excuse for a call.  
     – Trump has said he won’t initiate; China doesn’t want to appear weak by asking. This standoff argues further against a May–June call.

4. Justification  
   • Base rate for high-tension leader-to-leader calls is low (~1–2/year).  
   • The 34-day window is short and lacks an obvious trigger (no summit, no crisis that mandates leader-level de-escalation).  
   • Public posturing: Trump’s “China must call me first” stance and Beijing’s “door is open but on equal terms” response create mutual inertia.  
   • Historical analogy (Xi–Biden): even under a less rancorous relationship, calls average one per quarter; under Trump–Xi in a trade war, frequency is lower.  
   → On an outside-view basis, the chance of a call in this period is well below 50%, likely in the teens.

Outside view calibration:  
– Base‐rate anchor: 1.5 calls per year under tension → 14% for 1.1 months.  
– Upward adjustments? January call signals openness, but CNN shows renewed standoff → net zero adjustment.  
– Downward adjustments? Lack of a convening event and mutual reluctance decrease chances slightly.  

Adjusted outside view ≈ 15–18%.

Outside View Prediction:  
I assign a 17% probability that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will speak on the phone with each other between May 12 and June 15, 2025.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Axios special report (Jan 19 2021) – A reputable U.S. politics outlet; article is fact–heavy (tariff counts, agency actions) with light opinion quotes from an unnamed senior official.  Facts are reliable for describing the 2017-20 Trump-Xi interaction tempo (trade war, multiple measures).  Opinions (e.g., “extreme actions were necessary”) are not incorporated in the probability estimate.  
• CFR blog (Jan 17 2025) – Council on Foreign Relations is authoritative; the blog post cites two official read-outs.  Factual core: Xi and Trump held a call on 17 Jan 2025, their first since 2021.  Commentary that their personal rapport “appears warmer” is author opinion.  
• Straight Arrow News (Jan 17 2025) – Straight transcription of Trump’s Truth-Social post plus Chinese MFA statement.  Mostly factual.  
• PBS News (Jan 19 2025) – PBS is high-quality.  Facts: Xi will not attend the inauguration; the 17 Jan call occurred; cabinet choices noted.  Interpretation about “rising tensions” is mild opinion.  
• CNN (Apr 10 2025) – Mainstream, multiple named/unnamed officials.  Facts: tariff hikes, no leader-level contact since January, White House insists China must initiate.  Several unattributed quotes reflect possible spin; they are treated cautiously.  
• New York Post (Sept 23 2024) – Sensationalist but direct Trump quotes are primary-source material.  Opinions from participants are ignored.  
• Perplexity report – A secondary synthesis pulling from multiple outlets.  Factual timeline of confirmed calls (Feb 9 2017; Jan 17 2025) is consistent with open-source chronologies.  Assertions about “April 25 2025 interview” and China’s denial are noted but not independently verified here, so they carry lower weight.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Frequency of direct phone calls between a U.S. president and the Chinese leader while both are in office.  
   –  Obama-Xi (2013-16): ≈2 calls / yr.  
   –  Trump-Xi (2017-20): ≈4 calls / yr (trade war peak).  
   –  Biden-Xi (2021-24): ≈1-2 calls / yr.  
   Base-rate ≈2 calls per 12 months (i.e., 1 every 180 days).  

2. Frequency of Trump–Xi phone calls when Trump is in office (1st term) → ≈4 / yr ⇒ 1 every 90 days.  

3. Frequency of any U.S.–China leader call during an acute trade confrontation (2018-19) → 2-3 calls per calendar year ⇒ 1 every 140-180 days.  

Class #2 is closest: same two individuals, same style of personal diplomacy.  I use it for the statistical baseline, with #1 and #3 as reasonableness checks.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 7 May 2025.  Observation window: 12 May – 14 Jun 2025 inclusive (34 days; the question says “before 15 Jun”, so 39 days counting 12–14 Jun plus the five days until window opens).  If the historical interval between calls averages 90 days, the unconditional chance that one falls inside a random 39-day corridor is 39 ⁄ 90 ≈ 43%.  Using the more conservative 180-day spacing from the broader reference class gives 39 ⁄ 180 ≈ 22%.

(d) Justification for the outside view  
• We purposely ignore the April tariff standoff specifics and treat only long-run regularity: Trump and Xi have proved willing to pick up the phone even amid acrimony (calls in 2017 trade tensions, Jan 2025 call despite campaign hawkishness).  
• Their historical calling rhythm (class #2) is roughly quarterly; that implies a mid-level base probability (~40%) for any given 39-day window once Trump is in office.  
• However, the base rate must be diluted for two outside-view reasons:  
  –  The empirical distribution of calls is lumpy (often clustered around summits/negotiations, thin otherwise).  May–June 2025 is not tied to a pre-scheduled summit.  
  –  The event requires mutual public acknowledgement, shaving a few percentage points off the raw frequency.  
• Combining the optimistic 43% (90-day spacing) with the pessimistic 22% (180-day spacing) and down-weighting 10% for the “public acknowledgement” filter yields ≈(0.9×32.5%) ≈ 29%.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor 1 call every 90 days → 43% in 39 days.  
Anchor 1 call every 180 days → 22% in 39 days.  
Average of anchors: 32.5%.  
Adjust –3 pp for acknowledgement requirement → 29.5%.  
Round to nearest whole percent to avoid false precision → 30%.

Outside View Prediction:
30%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **South China Morning Post (April 28, 2025)**: High-quality source reporting China's Foreign Ministry official denial of recent Trump-Xi calls. Spokesperson Guo Jiakun directly quoted denying any recent calls or tariff negotiations.

2. **Reuters (April 28, 2025)**: Reputable international news agency confirming Chinese denial of Trump's call claims. Provides additional context on U.S.-China tariff situation (U.S. 100%+ tariffs, China 125% tariffs).

3. **Anadolu Agency (late April 2025)**: Turkish news agency reporting the same Chinese denial, with less detail but consistent facts.

4. **Yahoo Finance (May 7, 2025)**: Very recent reporting on upcoming Switzerland trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Critically quotes Trump saying "I have no plans to speak to [Xi Jinping]" while remaining open to eventual tariff reductions.

5. **Reuters (April 25, 2025)**: Reports Trump's claim that Xi "called" him, with Beijing disputing this characterization. Contains direct quotes from Trump about tariff negotiations.

6. **SCMP (Feb 6, 2025)**: Analysis piece with expert opinion from Pang Zhongying explaining cultural and diplomatic factors making spontaneous Xi-Trump calls unlikely, noting fundamental differences in diplomatic approach.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Trump's explicit statement (May 7, 2025) that he has "no plans to speak to Xi Jinping" (Yahoo Finance)
- China's Foreign Ministry official, on-record denial of recent calls and negotiations (multiple sources)
- Expert analysis from Pang Zhongying explaining why Xi is unlikely to "hop on a call" with Trump due to Chinese diplomatic protocols (SCMP)

**Moderate evidence:**
- Lower-level diplomatic channels remain active (U.S.-China trade talks in Switzerland this weekend)
- Extremely high mutual tariffs (145% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, 125% Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods) creating economic pressure for resolution
- Trump's demonstrated pattern of claiming communications that China denies, suggesting fundamental disconnect in diplomatic approach

**Weak evidence:**
- Trump's statement that "at some point" he would lower tariffs suggests potential for eventual dialogue
- The natural diplomatic expectation that major powers typically maintain communication during tensions

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window spans May 7, 2025 (today) to June 15, 2025—approximately 39 days.

If the timeframe were halved (~20 days), probability would decrease significantly, as there would be less time for the upcoming Switzerland talks to potentially lay groundwork for leader communication.

If the timeframe were doubled (~78 days), probability would increase moderately, as economic pressures from tariffs would have more time to force political necessity for direct leader communication.

## (d) Justification

Multiple factors strongly suggest a call is unlikely within this timeframe:

1. **Current explicit positions:** Trump stated today (May 7) he has "no plans to speak to Xi," while China's Foreign Ministry has been repeatedly denying communications. These statements represent concrete, recent barriers.

2. **Diplomatic standoff:** Current evidence reveals a situation where Trump insists Xi must call first, while China refuses to appear submissive by initiating contact—a classic diplomatic impasse.

3. **Lower-level engagement:** Both sides appear to be pursuing alternative channels (Switzerland talks) rather than direct leader communication, suggesting a deliberate strategy to avoid leader-level engagement.

4. **Cultural/protocol barriers:** Expert analysis indicates fundamental differences in diplomatic approach—China's formal, structured protocols versus Trump's spontaneous style—creating structural impediments to communication.

Factors potentially supporting a call:

1. **Economic pressure:** Extremely high mutual tariffs (145%/125%) create strong economic incentives to resolve tensions, which could eventually overcome diplomatic posturing.

2. **Lower-level diplomatic building blocks:** The Switzerland talks could potentially lay groundwork for eventual leader communication if successful.

The combined evidence strongly suggests both leaders are currently unwilling to initiate contact. Given Trump's very recent statement (today) that he has "no plans to speak to Xi," the clear official Chinese denials, and the expert analysis of protocol barriers, the probability of a call within 39 days appears significantly below 50%.

## Probability calibration

The outside view prediction is 27%, but after assessing additional factors and recent information, I need to adjust this:

- Trump's statement from today (May 7) explicitly saying he has "no plans to speak to Xi" is very recent and directly relevant
- The upcoming Switzerland talks indicate both sides are pursuing lower-level diplomatic channels instead
- Economic pressures from extreme tariffs provide some counterbalance, creating incentives for resolution

Considering the very recent (today) statement from Trump saying he has "no plans" to speak with Xi, I believe the probability should be adjusted slightly downward from the outside view.

Probability: 25%

## Checklist:
1. Will Trump and Xi have a mutually acknowledged phone conversation between May 12-June 15, 2025? (~39 days)
2. Base rate: 27% from outside view, adjusted to 25% based on very recent evidence
3. 25 out of 100 times, Trump and Xi would speak by phone in this 39-day window given current conditions
4. Key evidence: Trump's explicit "no plans" statement (May 7), China's official denial of communications, structural diplomatic protocol differences, extreme economic pressures from mutual tariffs
5. Blind spot: A sudden economic crisis forces urgent communication despite diplomatic barriers
6. Status quo is no direct communication; current evidence strongly supports continuation

Probability: 25%
Predicted Probability: 25.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **South China Morning Post (April 28, 2025)** - Reputable Hong Kong-based newspaper with strong China coverage. Reports China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun officially denying any recent phone call between Trump and Xi, directly contradicting Trump's claims.

2. **Reuters (April 28, 2025)** - Highly credible global news agency reporting the same denial from China's foreign ministry, adding context about ongoing trade tensions. Contains factual reporting with statements from both sides.

3. **Anadolu Agency (AA)** - Turkish state-run news agency. Limited extract available, but corroborates other reports about China's denial of Trump's phone call claims.

4. **Yahoo Finance (May 7, 2025)** - Most recent source. Reports upcoming US-China trade talks in Switzerland, with Trump stating "I have no plans to speak to [Xi Jinping]" earlier this week. Provides comprehensive updates on multiple trade negotiations.

5. **Reuters (April 25, 2025)** - Earlier article reporting Trump's initial claim that Xi called him and China's dispute of this characterization.

6. **South China Morning Post (Feb 6, 2025)** - Analysis article with expert opinion from Pang Zhongying (visiting senior fellow, ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute) explaining cultural and diplomatic factors behind Xi's reluctance to engage in spontaneous phone diplomacy.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
1. **Official Chinese denial** (Multiple sources) - China's Foreign Ministry spokesman explicitly denied any recent phone call between Xi and Trump, calling Trump's claims false.

2. **Trump's most recent statement** (Yahoo Finance, May 7, 2025) - Trump explicitly stated "I have no plans to speak to [Xi Jinping]" earlier this week.

3. **Structural difference in diplomatic approaches** (SCMP, Feb 6, 2025) - Expert analysis explains fundamental differences between Trump's spontaneous approach and China's formalized protocol requiring extensive preparation.

**Moderate evidence:**
1. **Upcoming Switzerland trade talks** (Yahoo Finance, May 7, 2025) - High-level but not leader-level talks are scheduled, indicating communication through designated channels rather than directly between leaders.

2. **Ongoing trade tensions** (Multiple sources) - Severe tariffs imposed by both sides (US: up to 245%, China: 125%) create tension that makes leader-level communication difficult without substantial preparation.

**Weak evidence:**
1. **Trump's earlier claims** (Reuters, April 25, 2025) - Trump claimed Xi had called him, but this has been explicitly denied by China without corroboration.

2. **Partial trade exemptions** (Yahoo Finance, May 7, 2025) - Reports that China compiled a list of US goods exempt from retaliatory tariffs could signal minor de-escalation, but source is unspecified.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is May 12-June 15, 2025 (34 days). If halved to ~17 days, probability would decrease further since there's little immediate groundwork for a leader-level call, and the Switzerland talks haven't occurred yet. If doubled to ~68 days, probability would increase moderately, allowing more time for the Switzerland talks to potentially yield results warranting leader follow-up and for economic pressures to build.

## (d) Justification for Inside View Prediction

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. Trump's explicit recent statement (May 6/7) of "no plans to speak to Xi Jinping" directly addresses the question.

2. China's official denial of previous call claims creates an adversarial dynamic around communication itself.

3. Fundamental differences in diplomatic approaches, with China requiring substantial groundwork before leader-level calls. The 34-day window provides limited time for such preparations.

4. Current communication channeled through lower-level officials (Switzerland talks).

**Factors potentially increasing probability:**
1. Severe tariff situation creating economic pressure that might eventually necessitate leader-level intervention.

2. Trump's history of unpredictable diplomatic moves.

3. Switzerland talks potentially producing enough progress to warrant a follow-up call.

The negative factors appear stronger and more concrete than the potential positive factors. Trump's explicit "no plans" statement is particularly significant as it directly addresses the question and is very recent.

## Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view prediction of 2% (±1%), I need to adjust downward based on the specific evidence analyzed.

The most significant update comes from Trump's explicit May 6/7 statement that he has "no plans to speak to Xi Jinping." This direct, recent evidence specifically addressing the forecast question substantially reduces likelihood below the base rate.

The Chinese denial of Trump's previous call claims adds further negative pressure by creating a public disagreement about communication itself. The expert analysis on fundamental differences in diplomatic approaches provides structural context explaining why spontaneous calls are particularly unlikely between these specific leaders.

However, I shouldn't reduce to zero because Trump is known for unpredictable moves, the economic implications of the tariff war could create unexpected urgency, and unforeseen external events could necessitate direct communication.

Calibrating from the outside view of 2% to approximately 1% reflects that while a call remains possible, the specific evidence against such a call occurring in this timeframe is strong.

## Checklist:
1. Will Trump and Xi have a phone conversation between May 12-June 15, 2025? Requires mutual acknowledgment and direct oral telecommunication.
2. Outside base rate: 2% (±1%) based on historical frequency (2 Trump-Xi calls in 8 years).
3. 1 out of 100 times, Trump and Xi would speak by phone in this 34-day window.
4. Key evidence: Trump's "no plans" statement (May 7); China's official denial creating communication tension; expert confirmation of diplomatic approach differences; communication channeled through lower officials.
5. Blind spot: A major global crisis (Taiwan, North Korea) could necessitate direct leader communication.
6. Status quo is no direct communication; 1% already captures this reality.

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%

Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
- South China Morning Post (Apr 28): Reports Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun’s categorical denial of any recent Xi–Trump call or negotiations. High reliability: direct quotes from an official.  
- Reuters (Apr 28): Corroborates SCMP denial, quoting Guo Jiakun and summarizing tariff standoff. High reliability.  
- Anadolu Agency via SCMP (Apr 28): Matches SCMP and Reuters’ denials. Moderate reliability but redundant.  
- Reuters (Apr 25): Reports Trump’s Time interview claim that Xi “called” him, with no supporting evidence from Chinese side. High reliability on the claim’s existence but not its veracity.  
- Yahoo Finance live updates (May 7): Details working‐level trade talks in Switzerland; notes Trump saying “I have no plans to speak to [Xi].” Moderate reliability; no direct phone‐call mention.  
- SCMP analysis (Feb 6): Explains Chinese protocol aversion to informal calls and Trump’s impulsive style. Moderate reliability; expert opinions from Pang Zhongying.

b) Evidence analysis  
- Strong negative evidence: China’s official denial of any call (two independent, direct, high-credibility sources).  
- Moderate negative evidence: Entrenched diplomatic impasse (Trump insists Xi call first; China won’t appear weak), and Chinese protocol against off-the-cuff calls.  
- Moderate positive evidence: Severe tariff pain on both sides, active working-level channels, both leaders under pressure to show progress.  
- Weak positive evidence: Past precedent of Trump-Xi communications (Feb 2017, Jan 2025) suggesting channels exist.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 39 days (May 12–June 15, 2025).  
- If window halved (~20 days): less time to overcome standoff => probability falls by ~30%.  
- If window doubled (~78 days): slightly more opportunity for a breakthrough => probability rises by ~20%.

d) Justification & adjustment  
Outside view base rate (reference class: calls between Trump and Xi during trade crises): ~23%.  
Current adjustments:  
- Strong evidence of no call to date and public denials → large downward shift.  
- Standoff entrenched for 3+ months, Chinese protocol favoring deferral → moderate downward shift.  
- Economic pressure and active trade talks → moderate upward shift.  
Net adjustment: 23% → 15%.  

Probability calibration  
Given the longevity of the impasse, high-credibility denials, and limited time remaining, a mid-teens probability best reflects both the low likelihood of breaking the stalemate and the nonzero chance of a last-minute face-saving arrangement.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Xi speak by phone between May 12 and June 15, 2025?  
2. Outside view base rate: 23%.  
3. Consistency: “15 out of 100 times, they’ll confirm a call in this window.”  
4. Key evidence: China’s denials (strong); diplomatic standoff entrenchment (moderate); Chinese protocol (moderate); economic pressure (moderate+); existing channels (weak).  
5. Blind-spot: A surprise, third-party brokered call could occur without public lead-up, raising realized probability.  
6. Status quo: No call has occurred yet; positions have hardened.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of Question and Resolution  
Will Trump and Xi speak on the phone in the narrow window from May 12, 2025 through June 15, 2025? Both sides must publicly acknowledge the call.

2. Source Analysis  
a. South China Morning Post (April 28, 2025): Reputable regional paper. Reports Trump’s claim in a Time interview that Xi “called,” and official Foreign Ministry denial. High factual quality; quotes a named spokesman.  
b. Reuters (April 28, 2025): Global wire service. Confirms SCMP narrative—Trump claims talks, China denies. High reliability, uses direct quotes from Guo Jiakun.  
c. Anadolu Agency (April 28, 2025): Partial repost of SCMP content. Medium reliability; no new facts beyond the Chinese denial.  
d. Yahoo Finance (May 7, 2025): Business‐news aggregator. Covers broader U.S. tariff diplomacy but makes no mention of a Trump–Xi call. Medium reliability; absence of coverage is mildly informative.  
e. Reuters (April 25, 2025): Reports Trump’s Time interview claim, Beijing “disputes” it. High reliability, context on trade-war dynamics.  
f. South China Morning Post (Feb 6, 2025): Analytical piece by commentators on China’s protocol aversion to off-the-cuff calls. Medium–high reliability for expert views; explains institutional reluctance.

3. Evidence Analysis  
Strong Evidence:  
- Multiple independent outlets (SCMP, Reuters, AA) consistently report an explicit Chinese denial of any recent call → reduces likelihood.  
- Historical pattern: Under high tension, leader calls average 1–2 per year (≈14% chance in 1.1 months).  

Moderate Evidence:  
- Trump’s recent public statements that he “has no plans” to call, and that China must initiate if desired.  
- Absence of any scheduled bilateral summit or major crisis that would trigger choreography of a call.  
- Expert commentary on China’s protocol aversion to spontaneous calls.  

Weak Evidence:  
- January 17, 2025 call shows it can happen—but that event followed Trump’s inauguration dynamics, not repeated lightly.  
- Broader U.S. trade negotiations behind the scenes may produce meetings at the ministerial level rather than leader calls.

4. Timeframe Analysis  
Window = 34 days ≈ 1.1 months.  
Base‐rate: 1.5 calls/year → 14% chance in this window.  
If window were half as long (~17 days), expect ~7% chance. If twice as long (~68 days), expect ~28% chance.  

5. Justification and Inside View  
- Outside‐view anchor (historical reference class) = 14%.  
- Downward adjustments: clear public denials by China; mutual reluctance; no convening event; Trump says he won’t call. (−3 pp)  
- Upward adjustments: previous January call demonstrates possibility; ongoing high‐stakes tariff talks keep lines nominally open. (+4 pp net zero)  
Net adjustment: modest downward from 14% → ~11–15%. Given the weight of structured obstacles, I center on 15%.

Probability calibration  
I assign a 15% probability that Trump and Xi will speak on the phone between May 12 and June 15 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Xi talk by phone between May 12 and June 15 2025? (Correct, acknowledges both sides must confirm.)  
2. Base rate: 1.5 calls/year under tension → ~14% in 1.1 months. We use this as anchor.  
3. Consistency: “15 out of 100 times, a call happens in this window given similar conditions.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Chinese official denial (strong)  
   • No scheduled summit or crisis trigger (moderate)  
   • Historical call frequency low (strong)  
   • Trump’s public unwillingness (moderate)  
   • China’s protocol aversion (moderate)  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden crisis (e.g. large market crash or security incident) could force an out-of-schedule call. If that happens, probability should be revised upward.  
6. Status quo: No call is default. Relations are tense but stable, reinforcing the status quo of no direct leader contact.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• SCMP (28 Apr 25).  Large HK paper, good China access, often breaks MFA lines within minutes.  Mostly factual quotes from MFA spokesman Guo Jiakun; opinion minimal.  High reliability.  
• Reuters (28 Apr 25).  Global wire service; double-sourced (Beijing presser + Time interview).  Very high reliability.  
• Anadolu Agency (28 Apr 25).  Turkish state wire; short and derivative of SCMP.  Moderate reliability, adds no new facts.  
• Yahoo Finance live blog (7 May 25).  Collates TV clips, White-House pool notes, Bloomberg/FT reporting.  Factual items are sourced; reliability medium–high.  
• Reuters (25 Apr 25) Time-interview story.  Primary quotes from Trump, cross-checked with Chinese denial.  High reliability.  
• SCMP backgrounder (6 Feb 25).  Mostly expert commentary explaining Beijing’s protocol.  Facts (e.g., rarity of ad-hoc Xi calls) sound; the rest is analysis.  Good quality.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• MFA spokesperson (Guo) explicitly says “no recent call” – independent confirmations (SCMP, Reuters, Anadolu) → weight = strong, direction = against imminent call.  
• Trump (NBC, WH gaggle) quotes: “I have no plans to speak to Xi.”  Direct statement from one principal → strong, against.  
Moderate evidence  
• High-level ministerial meeting in Switzerland (10-11 May) – signals potential thaw; a successful meeting often precedes a leader call to ratify deals → moderate, in favour.  
• Historical pattern: During 2018-19 tariff escalations, leader calls were used to de-escalate about once every 4-6 months → moderate, in favour (but note last genuine call was Jan 17 25, only ~4 months ago).  
Weak evidence  
• Trump habitually exaggerates or invents calls; China’s denial suggests reputational cost for Beijing if it later admits a call that Trump had “lied” about – speculative but tilts against.  
• Domestic distractions (Saudi trip, G7 in Italy mid-June) may crowd the calendar of both leaders – weak, against.

Evidence weighting summary  
Against a call: two strong + one weak  
For a call: two moderate  
Net pull: downward from the 30 % outside view.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window: 12 May – 14 Jun 2025 (39 days).  
If the window were halved to 19 days I would cut probability roughly one-third (to ~16 %); if doubled to 78 days I would raise to ~36 %.  This reflects a near-linear hazard rate once background factors are controlled.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
1.  Chinese public denial and protocol rigidity.  Beijing rarely reverses itself within weeks after an official spokesman’s flat denial, because it would highlight inconsistency.  This is a strong structural factor that suppresses the chance of an acknowledged call.  – 8 pp.  
2.  Trump’s current posture (“I have no plans…”) removes the usual trigger where he himself dials Xi.  Without U.S. initiative the burden shifts to Beijing, which point (1) shows is unlikely.  – 4 pp.  
3.  The Switzerland ministerial talks create a non-trivial path: if He Lifeng and Bessent reach a mini-deal in the next week, a leader-level blessing could quickly follow, fitting exactly inside the Metaculus window.  Historical precedent (Dec 2019 Phase 1 deal) shows such choreography.  +5 pp.  
4.  Only four months since the last confirmed call; calls have historically spaced ≥4 months during high-tension periods.  We are right at that lower bound, moderately supportive.  +2 pp.  
5.  Mutual acknowledgement requirement subtracts a bit more because Trump alone claiming is insufficient.  –2 pp.

Starting from 30 %  
30 – 8 – 4 + 5 + 2 – 2 = 23 % (rounded).

Probability calibration
My median forecast is therefore 23 %.  In odds: roughly 3 to 1 against.  
A ±10 % absolute change would occur if (a) the Swiss talks collapse publicly (probability would slide to ~15 %), or (b) credible leaks emerge that deal text is ready needing only the two leaders’ approval (would jump to ~33 %).

Checklist:
1. Question: “Between 12 May and 14 Jun 25, will Trump & Xi both acknowledge a phone call?”  
2. Outside view: 30 % chance.  
3. Consistency: “23 out of 100 times, they will speak on the phone in that window” – yes, matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Chinese MFA denial April 28; (ii) Trump says “no plans” May 6; (iii) Swiss ministerial meeting May 10–11; (iv) last real call Jan 17 25; (v) calls used to seal deals historically.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden crisis (Taiwan accident, South-China-Sea clash) prompting urgent leader-level hotline; would push probability much higher.  
6. Status-quo outcome is “No call”; slow diplomacy plus protocol inertia favour continuation.

Probability: 23%
Predicted Probability: 23.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **South China Morning Post (April 28, 2025)**: High-quality source reporting China's Foreign Ministry official denial of recent Trump-Xi calls. Spokesperson Guo Jiakun directly quoted denying any recent calls or tariff negotiations.

2. **Reuters (April 28, 2025)**: Reputable international news agency confirming Chinese denial of Trump's call claims. Provides additional context on U.S.-China tariff situation (U.S. 100%+ tariffs, China 125% tariffs).

3. **Anadolu Agency (late April 2025)**: Turkish news agency reporting the same Chinese denial, with less detail but consistent facts.

4. **Yahoo Finance (May 7, 2025)**: Very recent reporting on upcoming Switzerland trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Critically quotes Trump saying "I have no plans to speak to [Xi Jinping]" while remaining open to eventual tariff reductions.

5. **Reuters (April 25, 2025)**: Reports Trump's claim that Xi "called" him, with Beijing disputing this characterization. Contains direct quotes from Trump about tariff negotiations.

6. **SCMP (Feb 6, 2025)**: Analysis piece with expert opinion from Pang Zhongying explaining cultural and diplomatic factors making spontaneous Xi-Trump calls unlikely, noting fundamental differences in diplomatic approach.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Trump's explicit statement (May 7, 2025) that he has "no plans to speak to Xi Jinping" (Yahoo Finance)
- China's Foreign Ministry official, on-record denial of recent calls and negotiations (multiple sources)
- Expert analysis from Pang Zhongying explaining why Xi is unlikely to "hop on a call" with Trump due to Chinese diplomatic protocols (SCMP)

**Moderate evidence:**
- Lower-level diplomatic channels remain active (U.S.-China trade talks in Switzerland this weekend)
- Extremely high mutual tariffs (145% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, 125% Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods) creating economic pressure for resolution
- Trump's demonstrated pattern of claiming communications that China denies, suggesting fundamental disconnect in diplomatic approach

**Weak evidence:**
- Trump's statement that "at some point" he would lower tariffs suggests potential for eventual dialogue
- The natural diplomatic expectation that major powers typically maintain communication during tensions

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window spans May 7, 2025 (today) to June 15, 2025—approximately 39 days.

If the timeframe were halved (~20 days), probability would decrease significantly, as there would be less time for the upcoming Switzerland talks to potentially lay groundwork for leader communication.

If the timeframe were doubled (~78 days), probability would increase moderately, as economic pressures from tariffs would have more time to force political necessity for direct leader communication.

## (d) Justification

Multiple factors strongly suggest a call is unlikely within this timeframe:

1. **Current explicit positions:** Trump stated today (May 7) he has "no plans to speak to Xi," while China's Foreign Ministry has been repeatedly denying communications. These statements represent concrete, recent barriers.

2. **Diplomatic standoff:** Current evidence reveals a situation where Trump insists Xi must call first, while China refuses to appear submissive by initiating contact—a classic diplomatic impasse.

3. **Lower-level engagement:** Both sides appear to be pursuing alternative channels (Switzerland talks) rather than direct leader communication, suggesting a deliberate strategy to avoid leader-level engagement.

4. **Cultural/protocol barriers:** Expert analysis indicates fundamental differences in diplomatic approach—China's formal, structured protocols versus Trump's spontaneous style—creating structural impediments to communication.

Factors potentially supporting a call:

1. **Economic pressure:** Extremely high mutual tariffs (145%/125%) create strong economic incentives to resolve tensions, which could eventually overcome diplomatic posturing.

2. **Lower-level diplomatic building blocks:** The Switzerland talks could potentially lay groundwork for eventual leader communication if successful.

The combined evidence strongly suggests both leaders are currently unwilling to initiate contact. Given Trump's very recent statement (today) that he has "no plans to speak to Xi," the clear official Chinese denials, and the expert analysis of protocol barriers, the probability of a call within 39 days appears significantly below 50%.

## Probability calibration

The outside view prediction is 27%, but after assessing additional factors and recent information, I need to adjust this:

- Trump's statement from today (May 7) explicitly saying he has "no plans to speak to Xi" is very recent and directly relevant
- The upcoming Switzerland talks indicate both sides are pursuing lower-level diplomatic channels instead
- Economic pressures from extreme tariffs provide some counterbalance, creating incentives for resolution

Considering the very recent (today) statement from Trump saying he has "no plans" to speak with Xi, I believe the probability should be adjusted slightly downward from the outside view.

Probability: 25%

## Checklist:
1. Will Trump and Xi have a mutually acknowledged phone conversation between May 12-June 15, 2025? (~39 days)
2. Base rate: 27% from outside view, adjusted to 25% based on very recent evidence
3. 25 out of 100 times, Trump and Xi would speak by phone in this 39-day window given current conditions
4. Key evidence: Trump's explicit "no plans" statement (May 7), China's official denial of communications, structural diplomatic protocol differences, extreme economic pressures from mutual tariffs
5. Blind spot: A sudden economic crisis forces urgent communication despite diplomatic barriers
6. Status quo is no direct communication; current evidence strongly supports continuation

Calibrating from the outside view of 2% to approximately 1% reflects that while a call remains possible, the specific evidence against such a call occurring in this timeframe is strong.

## Checklist:
1. Will Trump and Xi have a phone conversation between May 12-June 15, 2025? Requires mutual acknowledgment and direct oral telecommunication.
2. Outside base rate: 2% (±1%) based on historical frequency (2 Trump-Xi calls in 8 years).
3. 1 out of 100 times, Trump and Xi would speak by phone in this 34-day window.
4. Key evidence: Trump's "no plans" statement (May 7); China's official denial creating communication tension; expert confirmation of diplomatic approach differences; communication channeled through lower officials.
5. Blind spot: A major global crisis (Taiwan, North Korea) could necessitate direct leader communication.
6. Status quo is no direct communication; 1% already captures this reality.

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%

Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
- South China Morning Post (Apr 28): Reports Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun’s categorical denial of any recent Xi–Trump call or negotiations. High reliability: direct quotes from an official.  
- Reuters (Apr 28): Corroborates SCMP denial, quoting Guo Jiakun and summarizing tariff standoff. High reliability.  
- Anadolu Agency via SCMP (Apr 28): Matches SCMP and Reuters’ denials. Moderate reliability but redundant.  
- Reuters (Apr 25): Reports Trump’s Time interview claim that Xi “called” him, with no supporting evidence from Chinese side. High reliability on the claim’s existence but not its veracity.  
- Yahoo Finance live updates (May 7): Details working‐level trade talks in Switzerland; notes Trump saying “I have no plans to speak to [Xi].” Moderate reliability; no direct phone‐call mention.  
- SCMP analysis (Feb 6): Explains Chinese protocol aversion to informal calls and Trump’s impulsive style. Moderate reliability; expert opinions from Pang Zhongying.

b) Evidence analysis  
- Strong negative evidence: China’s official denial of any call (two independent, direct, high-credibility sources).  
- Moderate negative evidence: Entrenched diplomatic impasse (Trump insists Xi call first; China won’t appear weak), and Chinese protocol against off-the-cuff calls.  
- Moderate positive evidence: Severe tariff pain on both sides, active working-level channels, both leaders under pressure to show progress.  
- Weak positive evidence: Past precedent of Trump-Xi communications (Feb 2017, Jan 2025) suggesting channels exist.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 39 days (May 12–June 15, 2025).  
- If window halved (~20 days): less time to overcome standoff => probability falls by ~30%.  
- If window doubled (~78 days): slightly more opportunity for a breakthrough => probability rises by ~20%.

d) Justification & adjustment  
Outside view base rate (reference class: calls between Trump and Xi during trade crises): ~23%.  
Current adjustments:  
- Strong evidence of no call to date and public denials → large downward shift.  
- Standoff entrenched for 3+ months, Chinese protocol favoring deferral → moderate downward shift.  
- Economic pressure and active trade talks → moderate upward shift.  
Net adjustment: 23% → 15%.  

Probability calibration  
Given the longevity of the impasse, high-credibility denials, and limited time remaining, a mid-teens probability best reflects both the low likelihood of breaking the stalemate and the nonzero chance of a last-minute face-saving arrangement.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Xi speak by phone between May 12 and June 15, 2025?  
2. Outside view base rate: 23%.  
3. Consistency: “15 out of 100 times, they’ll confirm a call in this window.”  
4. Key evidence: China’s denials (strong); diplomatic standoff entrenchment (moderate); Chinese protocol (moderate); economic pressure (moderate+); existing channels (weak).  
5. Blind-spot: A surprise, third-party brokered call could occur without public lead-up, raising realized probability.  
6. Status quo: No call has occurred yet; positions have hardened.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of Question and Resolution  
Will Trump and Xi speak on the phone in the narrow window from May 12, 2025 through June 15, 2025? Both sides must publicly acknowledge the call.

2. Source Analysis  
a. South China Morning Post (April 28, 2025): Reputable regional paper. Reports Trump’s claim in a Time interview that Xi “called,” and official Foreign Ministry denial. High factual quality; quotes a named spokesman.  
b. Reuters (April 28, 2025): Global wire service. Confirms SCMP narrative—Trump claims talks, China denies. High reliability, uses direct quotes from Guo Jiakun.  
c. Anadolu Agency (April 28, 2025): Partial repost of SCMP content. Medium reliability; no new facts beyond the Chinese denial.  
d. Yahoo Finance (May 7, 2025): Business‐news aggregator. Covers broader U.S. tariff diplomacy but makes no mention of a Trump–Xi call. Medium reliability; absence of coverage is mildly informative.  
e. Reuters (April 25, 2025): Reports Trump’s Time interview claim, Beijing “disputes” it. High reliability, context on trade-war dynamics.  
f. South China Morning Post (Feb 6, 2025): Analytical piece by commentators on China’s protocol aversion to off-the-cuff calls. Medium–high reliability for expert views; explains institutional reluctance.

3. Evidence Analysis  
Strong Evidence:  
- Multiple independent outlets (SCMP, Reuters, AA) consistently report an explicit Chinese denial of any recent call → reduces likelihood.  
- Historical pattern: Under high tension, leader calls average 1–2 per year (≈14% chance in 1.1 months).  

Moderate Evidence:  
- Trump’s recent public statements that he “has no plans” to call, and that China must initiate if desired.  
- Absence of any scheduled bilateral summit or major crisis that would trigger choreography of a call.  
- Expert commentary on China’s protocol aversion to spontaneous calls.  

Weak Evidence:  
- January 17, 2025 call shows it can happen—but that event followed Trump’s inauguration dynamics, not repeated lightly.  
- Broader U.S. trade negotiations behind the scenes may produce meetings at the ministerial level rather than leader calls.

4. Timeframe Analysis  
Window = 34 days ≈ 1.1 months.  
Base‐rate: 1.5 calls/year → 14% chance in this window.  
If window were half as long (~17 days), expect ~7% chance. If twice as long (~68 days), expect ~28% chance.  

5. Justification and Inside View  
- Outside‐view anchor (historical reference class) = 14%.  
- Downward adjustments: clear public denials by China; mutual reluctance; no convening event; Trump says he won’t call. (−3 pp)  
- Upward adjustments: previous January call demonstrates possibility; ongoing high‐stakes tariff talks keep lines nominally open. (+4 pp net zero)  
Net adjustment: modest downward from 14% → ~11–15%. Given the weight of structured obstacles, I center on 15%.

Probability calibration  
I assign a 15% probability that Trump and Xi will speak on the phone between May 12 and June 15 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Xi talk by phone between May 12 and June 15 2025? (Correct, acknowledges both sides must confirm.)  
2. Base rate: 1.5 calls/year under tension → ~14% in 1.1 months. We use this as anchor.  
3. Consistency: “15 out of 100 times, a call happens in this window given similar conditions.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Chinese official denial (strong)  
   • No scheduled summit or crisis trigger (moderate)  
   • Historical call frequency low (strong)  
   • Trump’s public unwillingness (moderate)  
   • China’s protocol aversion (moderate)  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden crisis (e.g. large market crash or security incident) could force an out-of-schedule call. If that happens, probability should be revised upward.  
6. Status quo: No call is default. Relations are tense but stable, reinforcing the status quo of no direct leader contact.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• SCMP (28 Apr 25).  Large HK paper, good China access, often breaks MFA lines within minutes.  Mostly factual quotes from MFA spokesman Guo Jiakun; opinion minimal.  High reliability.  
• Reuters (28 Apr 25).  Global wire service; double-sourced (Beijing presser + Time interview).  Very high reliability.  
• Anadolu Agency (28 Apr 25).  Turkish state wire; short and derivative of SCMP.  Moderate reliability, adds no new facts.  
• Yahoo Finance live blog (7 May 25).  Collates TV clips, White-House pool notes, Bloomberg/FT reporting.  Factual items are sourced; reliability medium–high.  
• Reuters (25 Apr 25) Time-interview story.  Primary quotes from Trump, cross-checked with Chinese denial.  High reliability.  
• SCMP backgrounder (6 Feb 25).  Mostly expert commentary explaining Beijing’s protocol.  Facts (e.g., rarity of ad-hoc Xi calls) sound; the rest is analysis.  Good quality.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• MFA spokesperson (Guo) explicitly says “no recent call” – independent confirmations (SCMP, Reuters, Anadolu) → weight = strong, direction = against imminent call.  
• Trump (NBC, WH gaggle) quotes: “I have no plans to speak to Xi.”  Direct statement from one principal → strong, against.  
Moderate evidence  
• High-level ministerial meeting in Switzerland (10-11 May) – signals potential thaw; a successful meeting often precedes a leader call to ratify deals → moderate, in favour.  
• Historical pattern: During 2018-19 tariff escalations, leader calls were used to de-escalate about once every 4-6 months → moderate, in favour (but note last genuine call was Jan 17 25, only ~4 months ago).  
Weak evidence  
• Trump habitually exaggerates or invents calls; China’s denial suggests reputational cost for Beijing if it later admits a call that Trump had “lied” about – speculative but tilts against.  
• Domestic distractions (Saudi trip, G7 in Italy mid-June) may crowd the calendar of both leaders – weak, against.

Evidence weighting summary  
Against a call: two strong + one weak  
For a call: two moderate  
Net pull: downward from the 30 % outside view.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window: 12 May – 14 Jun 2025 (39 days).  
If the window were halved to 19 days I would cut probability roughly one-third (to ~16 %); if doubled to 78 days I would raise to ~36 %.  This reflects a near-linear hazard rate once background factors are controlled.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
1.  Chinese public denial and protocol rigidity.  Beijing rarely reverses itself within weeks after an official spokesman’s flat denial, because it would highlight inconsistency.  This is a strong structural factor that suppresses the chance of an acknowledged call.  – 8 pp.  
2.  Trump’s current posture (“I have no plans…”) removes the usual trigger where he himself dials Xi.  Without U.S. initiative the burden shifts to Beijing, which point (1) shows is unlikely.  – 4 pp.  
3.  The Switzerland ministerial talks create a non-trivial path: if He Lifeng and Bessent reach a mini-deal in the next week, a leader-level blessing could quickly follow, fitting exactly inside the Metaculus window.  Historical precedent (Dec 2019 Phase 1 deal) shows such choreography.  +5 pp.  
4.  Only four months since the last confirmed call; calls have historically spaced ≥4 months during high-tension periods.  We are right at that lower bound, moderately supportive.  +2 pp.  
5.  Mutual acknowledgement requirement subtracts a bit more because Trump alone claiming is insufficient.  –2 pp.

Starting from 30 %  
30 – 8 – 4 + 5 + 2 – 2 = 23 % (rounded).

Probability calibration
My median forecast is therefore 23 %.  In odds: roughly 3 to 1 against.  
A ±10 % absolute change would occur if (a) the Swiss talks collapse publicly (probability would slide to ~15 %), or (b) credible leaks emerge that deal text is ready needing only the two leaders’ approval (would jump to ~33 %).

Checklist:
1. Question: “Between 12 May and 14 Jun 25, will Trump & Xi both acknowledge a phone call?”  
2. Outside view: 30 % chance.  
3. Consistency: “23 out of 100 times, they will speak on the phone in that window” – yes, matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Chinese MFA denial April 28; (ii) Trump says “no plans” May 6; (iii) Swiss ministerial meeting May 10–11; (iv) last real call Jan 17 25; (v) calls used to seal deals historically.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden crisis (Taiwan accident, South-China-Sea clash) prompting urgent leader-level hotline; would push probability much higher.  
6. Status-quo outcome is “No call”; slow diplomacy plus protocol inertia favour continuation.

Probability: 23%
Predicted Probability: 23.0%...
