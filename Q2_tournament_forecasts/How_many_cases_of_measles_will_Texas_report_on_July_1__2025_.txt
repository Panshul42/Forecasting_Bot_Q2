Historical output: Analysis:
The key to an outside‐view forecast is knowing Texas’s baseline measles incidence over recent years and typical outbreak scale and seasonality. Pre-2025, annual measles counts in Texas were near zero in most years—with sporadic outbreaks (for example, ~50–120 cases in notable years like 2013 or 2019). Cases tend to cluster in spring and early summer, so historical counts by July 1 are a useful baseline. We also need historical vaccination coverage trends and policy shifts (exemptions, mandate changes) that influence outbreak size. Finally, comparing the current 663 cases as of April 29, 2025 against past outbreak trajectories will help shape the out-view and calibrate our in-view adjustment.

Key facts and figures  
• Texas is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in 30 years, centered in the South Plains region.  
• As of the most recent weekly report (data released Friday):  
  – Nine new cases were added over the past week, the fewest since February.  
  – Three counties were newly added to the outbreak area (including Potter and Parmer).  
• Cumulative statewide caseload is about 500, mostly young unvaccinated children.  
• In rural West Texas (primarily Gaines County):  
  – Nearly 150 cases, most among unvaccinated residents of a local Mennonite community.  
  – A school-age child has died there.  
• Across nine counties: more than 120 infections have been confirmed.  
• Two of the four cases in Lubbock mark that city’s first measles in over 20 years.  
• Several hospitalizations have occurred; at least one additional child death (Daisy Hildebrand).  
• The outbreak has spilled into multiple neighboring states.  
• State taxpayers have so far spent $4.5 million on immunization campaigns, testing, and public awareness.  
• Measles vaccination rates in Texas have declined over the past four years.

Opinions and expert commentary (reliable/named sources)  
• “Vaccination is the best way to avoid this highly contagious, potentially life-threatening disease,” say Texas health officials.  
• Public health experts urge:  
  – Better messaging on the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine.  
  – More rigorous quarantining and expanded contact tracing.  
• Adults unsure of their vaccination status are advised to get booster shots.  
• Federal grants have funded additional testing and vaccination staff in Lubbock and lab upgrades in Dallas.  
• U.S. Health Secretary (on a West Texas visit): Europe has a worse track record with measles and receives disproportionate media attention.

Less-reliable or disputed claims  
• Vaccine skeptic Dr. Robert Malone publicly announced Daisy Hildebrand’s death and blamed the hospital; her family says they never spoke with him.  
• Some local church groups (including parts of the Mennonite community) distrust government mandates and have resisted vaccination efforts.

Structural and political factors  
• Declining trust in government, politicization of public health and a strong “vaccine choice” movement in the Texas Legislature have hampered response efforts—even in districts represented by House leaders like Speaker Dustin Burrows.  
• Rural hospital infrastructure and long travel distances complicate specimen transport and testing capacity.

<Summary source="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-measles-outbreak-in-west-texas-and-beyond">
Here’s a concise summary of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health article (March 12, 2025) on the Southwest U.S. measles outbreak:

• Outbreak size and trend  
  – As of March 4, Texas reported 159 measles cases in 2025, 107 of them in Gaines County. By March 11 updates: 223 cases (156 in Gaines County), 29 hospitalizations, and 1 death (an unvaccinated school‐age child).  
  – Four additional Texas cases were linked to international travel.  
  – Most cases are in 5–17-year-olds who are unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status; a few had received only one MMR dose.  
  – New Mexico (bordering Gaines County) had 30 cases and 1 death as of March 7; isolated cases also appeared in New Jersey and Kentucky.

• Outbreak origins  
  – Began in a low-vaccination Mennonite community in West Texas with many homeschooled or private-schooled children.  
  – Similar patterns seen in 2019 (≈1,274 U.S. cases, including ~900 in an Orthodox Jewish community in New York) and 2014 (383 cases in an Ohio Amish community).

• Transmission & control  
  – Exportation of cases from West Texas to other Texas counties and states.  
  – Measles is so contagious that ≥95% community immunity is needed to prevent outbreaks.  
  – The MMR vaccine is 93–95% effective after one dose, ≥97% after two doses; two-dose recipients are considered fully protected.

• Barriers to vaccination  
  – In the U.S., access is generally good; the main issue is demand, driven by vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and community-specific concerns.  
  – Trusted local messengers (e.g. religious leaders) are critical for outreach in close-knit, low-uptake communities.

• Adjunctive treatments  
  – Vitamin A: does not prevent infection, but in vitamin-A–deficient or undernourished populations can halve measles mortality and is used to reduce severity in hospitalized children. Not a substitute for vaccination; risk of toxicity if overdosed.  
  – Steroids: not recommended (may worsen secondary infections).  
  – Antibiotics: reserved for confirmed secondary bacterial infections (e.g. pneumonia, otitis media).

• Risk guidance  
  – Fully vaccinated individuals (two MMR doses) need not worry.  
  – One-dose individuals have higher risk of infection but generally milder disease.  
  – CDC advises two doses before international travel; travelers to U.S. outbreak areas should assess exposure risk.  
  – Higher-risk groups include infants <12 months and immunocompromised persons.

<Summary source="https://www.tpr.org/bioscience-medicine/2025-05-09/measles-update-state-of-texas-reports-7-more-measles-cases-since-tuesday">
Here’s a concise extraction of the key points from the TPR article “Measles update: State of Texas reports 7 more measles cases since Tuesday” (May 9, 2025):

1. Case counts and hospitalizations  
  • Texas DSHS confirmed 7 new measles cases since its last update (Tuesday), bringing the West Texas outbreak total to about 709 cases (outbreak began late January).  
  • 92 patients have been hospitalized (DSHS does not track how many remain in hospital).  

2. recent exposure in Fredericksburg  
  • A measles case in someone who visited Fredericksburg April 26 (arrived from El Paso, which had 44 linked cases at the time).  
  • Exposed locations (April 26): Burger Burger; Loca on Main; Felt Boutique; Allen’s Boots.  
  • Guidance: anyone in Fredericksburg that day who develops measles symptoms before May 17 should stay home and call a doctor (do not visit medical facilities).  

3. Other Texas cases and outbreak counties  
  • Mid-April: one measles case in Atascosa County (south of San Antonio), believed unrelated to the West Texas outbreak.  
  • DSHS-designated outbreak counties with ongoing transmission: Cochran, Dallam, Dawson, Gaines, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry, Yoakum.  
  • Garza and Lynn counties removed from that list after 42 days (two incubation periods) with no new infectious cases.  

4. National context (CDC data)  
  • Since May 8: 1,001 confirmed measles cases across 31 U.S. jurisdictions.  
  • 93% of those cases (928) are linked to 14 ongoing outbreaks.  
  • 2025 outbreak is the second-highest annual U.S. measles count in 25 years: 800 cases reported Jan 1–Apr 17.  

5. Severe outcomes and prevention  
  • Two unvaccinated, school-age children in West Texas have died from measles complications.  
  • State updates from DSHS are issued every Tuesday and Friday.  
  • Health-care professionals emphasize: the only way to prevent measles is two doses of the MMR vaccine.  
  • Measles complications can include pneumonia, hearing loss, meningitis, and death.

Summary of “Map: Track the spread of measles in the U.S.” (NBC News, May 16, 2025)

• NBC News is aggregating confirmed measles case counts from state health departments, updating the data every Tuesday and Friday.  
• As of mid-May 2025, the U.S. has logged over 1,000 measles cases this year—making 2025 the second-most active year for measles in the U.S. since its official elimination in 2000.  
• Texas accounts for roughly two-thirds of all U.S. cases in 2025.  
• “Elimination” of measles is defined as absence of continuous disease transmission for at least 12 months; despite sporadic outbreaks since 2000, current levels remain far below historic peaks.  
• For context:  
  – 27,000 measles cases were reported in 1990  
  – 450,000 cases were reported in 1964  
• The measles vaccine, introduced in 1963, drastically reduced both incidence and mortality from the disease.

Current output: Analysis:
The key to forecasting Texas measles cases by July 1, 2025 is tracking the momentum of the current outbreak (663 cases as of late April), recent case trajectories, and the strength of public health responses—particularly vaccination campaigns, school immunization enforcement, and local containment efforts. I need updates on daily or weekly case counts since April, county-level spread, any changes in vaccine mandate policies or exemptions, and reports on mobile clinics or public education drives. Understanding these factors will enable an inside-view adjustment to the base‐rate trajectory that projects whether cases will plateau, decline, or accelerate over the next five-plus weeks.

Here is a summary of “Texas Measles outbreak 2025: Four new cases reported in latest update” (FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth; Amber Kite):

• According to Texas Health and Human Services (HHS):  
  – Four new measles cases were identified since the previous (Friday) update.  
  – Fewer than 10 confirmed cases are believed to be actively infectious.  
  – Since late January, 722 cases have been confirmed statewide.

• County-level breakdown:  
  – Gaines County (outbreak center) reported no new cases; total remains 406 (over half of Texas’s cases).  
  – “Outbreak counties” designated by DSHS: Cochran, Dawson, Gaines, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum.  
  – Garza, Lynn and Dallam counties were removed from the outbreak list.

• Hospitalizations and outcomes:  
  – 92 patients have been hospitalized since the outbreak began (down by one since Friday). DSHS notes this reflects earlier hospital records and may change.  
  – Current number of people hospitalized was not released.  
  – Two school-aged children have died of measles complications; both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions, state officials said.

• Vaccination status of the 722 cases (since January):  
  – 688 (95%) unvaccinated  
  – 19 fully vaccinated  
  – 15 with one MMR dose

• Other Texas cases reported outside West Texas were deemed unconnected to this outbreak.

• Measles overview (from the article):  
  – Highly contagious respiratory virus spread via droplets/airborne particles (remains infectious up to two hours in air).  
  – Symptoms appear 1–2 weeks after exposure: high fever, cough, runny nose, red/watery eyes, followed by rash.  
  – Contagious from four days before to four days after rash onset.

• Prevention and control guidance:  
  – Two doses of MMR vaccine are highly effective; vaccinated people who do get measles usually have milder illness and are less likely to spread it.  
  – If exposed or symptomatic: isolate, call healthcare provider before testing, review vaccination history.  
  – During outbreaks, unimmunized individuals without documented immunity should be excluded from schools/childcare for at least 21 days after last exposure (per Texas Administrative Code §97.7).  

• Note: DSHS releases statewide measles case updates every Tuesday and Friday.

<Summary source="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/texas-announces-more-measles-cases-including-first-dallas-area">
Here is a concise summary of the Cidrap.umn (May 13, 2025) article, organized by topic and highlighting key facts, figures, and named sources.

1. Texas measles outbreak update  
  • The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) reported 8 new measles cases since its May 9 update, including the first two in the Dallas metro area (Collin and Rockwall counties), both linked to the large Gaines County–centered outbreak.  
  • Garza and Lynn counties were removed from the “active transmission” list after two full incubation periods passed since the last infectious case.  
  • The statewide outbreak total is now 717 cases spanning 32 counties. In addition, Texas has recorded 15 measles cases in counties not part of the West Texas outbreak.

2. Houston wastewater early warning  
  • A Baylor College of Medicine–led research team (in collaboration with the Houston Health Department and two other universities) detected measles virus RNA in Houston wastewater samples collected Jan 7—ten days before two traveler cases were clinically confirmed on Jan 17.  
  • Over the prior 31 months, 821 samples from the same treatment plants had tested negative.  
  • Findings were published in the American Journal of Public Health.

3. New recommendations for post-Lyme disease condition (Lyme IACI)  
  • The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report urging evaluation of treatments to alleviate fatigue, pain, and “brain fog” in the 10–20% of Lyme disease patients with long-term symptoms.  
  • Kent Kester, MD (committee chair; executive director of vaccine R&D at CEPI), said: “There is an urgent need to identify and develop safe and effective treatments for Lyme IACI…People living with this condition deserve to have information that allows them to both make informed decisions about their own health and to have safe and effective treatments available to them.”  
  • Only six randomized clinical trials on Lyme IACI have been done in the past 20 years (five antibiotic trials, one yoga trial)—none showed symptom benefit.  
  • The report recommends patient-centered trial design (focusing on the most bothersome symptoms) and use of biobanks for data collection to guide future therapy development.

4. Brief note on avian flu in China  
  • The article notes that China has reported additional human infections with H9N2 and H10N3 avian influenza viruses; no further details were provided in the excerpt.

Here’s a concise extraction of the key facts, figures and expert views from the April 23, 2025 Houston Chronicle article by Evan MacDonald:

1. Current outbreak size and trajectory  
   • Texas DSHS reported 624 confirmed measles cases as of April 8, 2025, including two deaths of school-aged children.  
   • Since Valentine’s Day (mid-February), the state has averaged ~50 new cases per week, with a two-week surge of 121 cases (week ending March 21) and 81 cases (week ending April 4).  

2. Underreporting concerns  
   • A CDC scientist (unnamed) believes “quite a large amount of cases” are not being reported, as many families haven’t sought testing or treatment.  [less-precise source]

3. Near-term projections  
   • If current pace holds, Texas could exceed 1,000 cases by early summer—its highest annual total since 1992.  

4. Expert opinions (named, reliable)  
   • Catherine Troisi (UTHealth Houston School of Public Health):  
     – “I think there’s at least a 50% chance we get up there [≥1,000 cases]. Maybe higher.”  
     – “We have all the ingredients … for this to just keep burning.”  
   • Rémy Pasco (UT Austin/UMass Amherst modeling partnership; research associate at CU Boulder):  
     – Steady weekly case counts make it impossible to tell whether the outbreak is near its end.  
     – “When there’s a steady number of cases every week, we don’t know whether we’re close to the end or not… Which is the frustrating part.”  
   • Rebecca Fischer (Texas A&M School of Public Health):  
     – “With measles, that is not a good thing… We always want to see (case numbers) going down.”  

5. Historical context  
   • Pre-MMR vaccine (introduced 1963): Texas routinely saw tens of thousands of cases/year.  
   • Post-second-dose recommendation (1989):  
     – 4,409 cases in 1990 (peak in two decades)  
     – 294 cases in 1991  
     – 1,097 cases in 1992  
   • Since 1992, the highest annual total was just 49 cases (1996)—surpassed this year just after Valentine’s Day.  

6. Geographic spread and susceptibility  
   • Active transmission in 10 Texas counties; larger cities such as Lubbock and El Paso are now reporting cases.  
   • Many Texans remain unprotected (no MMR vaccination or prior infection), and “pockets” of low-coverage communities persist in schools, day-cares, etc.  

7. Key drivers and uncertainties  
   • Human behavior and travel: an infectious person can spread measles up to four days before and after rash onset, making clusters somewhat random.  
   • Vaccination coverage: measles struggles to spread where ≥95% of a community is immune, but even a single low-coverage pocket can spark a new surge.  

8. Signs to watch for outbreak decline  
   • Contraction to fewer counties (currently 10) rather than continued geographic expansion  
   • Prevention of spread into additional large urban areas  

9. Critical control measure  
   • Boosting MMR vaccination coverage remains the lynchpin of stamping out the outbreak. “If vaccination coverage could be boosted, that’s how we’ll stamp this out,” Fischer said.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the Stateline article “As measles outbreaks grow, Trump cuts hinder vaccination efforts” by Tim Henderson (May 2, 2025).

Key Facts and Statistics  
• As of May 1, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 935 confirmed measles cases across 29 states.  
• Three confirmed deaths: two unvaccinated children in Texas and one unvaccinated adult in New Mexico.  
• The affected states are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Impact of Federal Funding Cuts  
• The Trump administration’s abrupt $11 billion cut in federal public health funding has forced multiple local governments to cancel or halt vaccination clinics.  
• Metro Nashville and three other local governments (including Harris County, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; and Kansas City, Missouri) sued on April 24, 2025, over these cuts.  
• Colorado and several other states filed an earlier lawsuit in April citing impaired capacity to control measles, flu and other vaccine-preventable diseases.  
• In their lawsuit, plaintiffs called the cuts “a massive blow… at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.”

Local Examples  
• Minneapolis shut down clinics in March that had been scheduled to run through June.  
  – In 2024, these clinics served 501 patients with 1,475 vaccination shots (including measles).  
  – Luisa Pessoa-Brandão, Minneapolis health initiatives director, noted about 30% of local children are not fully vaccinated.  
  – Cited barriers include COVID-related delays, access issues and vaccine misinformation.

Below is a concise summary of the NBC 5 Dallas–Fort Worth article “Measles continues to spread in Texas, cases climb to nearly 650 as US nears 900 infections” (April 25, 2025). All statistics and quotes are attributed to named sources within the article.

1. Outbreak size and trajectory  
   • 646 confirmed measles cases in Texas since late January (22 new cases since the previous Tuesday) — Texas DSHS data as of April 25.  
   • Nearly 900 total U.S. cases reported as of Friday — NBC 5 citing U.S. totals.  
   • Fewer than 10 of the 646 Texas cases are currently “actively infectious,” based on symptom timing.

2. Severe outcomes and hospitalizations  
   • 64 hospitalizations statewide during this outbreak.  
   • Two school-aged children in the outbreak region died (February and early April); neither had been vaccinated nor had known underlying conditions — Texas DSHS.

3. Recent case outside core outbreak region  
   • A student at Willow Springs Middle School (Lucas, Collin County) tested positive; exposure date April 7.  
   • Separate possible exposure in Plano at Walmart, Dollar Tree, and Ross near Hwy 75 & Parker Road — local health officials.  
   • It remains unclear if these are linked to the West Texas cluster.

4. Measles transmission and infectiousness  
   • Measles can be spread four days before to four days after rash onset — health officials.  
   • Virus can survive in air for up to two hours — CDC.  
   • Up to 90% of susceptible individuals will become infected upon exposure — CDC.

5. Vaccine efficacy, recommendations, and barriers  
   • Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% protective — Dr. Donna Persaud, Parkland Health.  
   • First dose recommended at 12–15 months; second at 4–6 years.  
   • Vaccine required for public school entry; communities need ≥95% coverage for herd immunity.  
   • No link between MMR and autism — Dr. Persaud.  
   • Adults born before 1957 likely immune due to natural infection; vaccine introduced in 1963.

6. Historical context  
   • Pre-1963 (pre-vaccine): 3–4 million U.S. cases per year.  
   • “Normal” post-vaccine years: fewer than 200 cases nationwide.

7. Local vaccination rates and outreach  
   • Gaines County: ~14% of K–12 children claimed ≥1 vaccine exemption in 2023–24 (excludes most homeschoolers) — Texas DSHS.  
   • Parkland Health’s free “Walk-in Wednesdays” vaccine events (9 a.m.–11 a.m. & 1 p.m.–4 p.m. on April 30) at COPC centers; other days by appointment (214-266-4000).  
   • Schools and community clinics are conducting screenings, education, and on-site immunizations.

8. Expert opinion (Dr. Donna Persaud, pediatrician & Parkland medical director)  
   • Described the situation as “a nightmare” and “very disheartening” given measles is preventable by a safe, highly effective vaccine.  
   • Emphasized long-lasting immunity from vaccination and the high rates of complications, hospitalizations, and deaths from measles versus the vaccine’s safety profile.  
   • Urged parents and adults uncertain of their status to consult healthcare providers and get vaccinated “— there’s virtually no harm.”

**Possible Mass Exposure to Measles at Shakira's Concert in the US**
The New Jersey Department of Health in the United States is investigating a possible mass exposure to measles after a person with the viral disease attended Shakira's concert on May 15 at the MetLife Stadium in New York. The person, who lives outside of New Jersey, may have exposed thousands of people to the disease during the concert, which lasted from 7:30 PM to 1:00 AM the next day. Authorities recommend that anyone who thinks they may have contracted measles to call their doctor before visiting a medical office or emergency room to receive treatment. They also urge the public to stay up-to-date on their vaccinations. Measles is caused by one of the most contagious viruses known, which spreads through the saliva droplets released by an infected person when they speak, cough, or sneeze. As of now, no new cases have been reported in New Jersey, but the US is facing a growing measles outbreak since March, with Texas being the main focus. Symptoms, which appear 10-14 days after exposure, include cough, runny nose, eye inflammation, sore throat, fever, and the characteristic red rash, which appears a few days later. The most severe complication is encephalitis, which develops in about 1 in 1,000 infected individuals and causes high mortality and severe neurological sequelae.

**Measles Outbreak: New Jersey Investigates Possible Mass Exposure at Shakira Concert**
The New Jersey Department of Health is investigating a possible mass exposure to measles at a Shakira concert held at the MetLife stadium in East Rutherford. A person with measles attended the concert on May 15, and the health department is warning those who may have been exposed to contact their doctor before seeking medical attention. The department is also urging the public to stay up-to-date with vaccinations. According to the CDC, there have been 111 new measles cases in the US this year, surpassing the peak of 102 cases in 2019. The majority of cases are concentrated in a current outbreak in Texas and neighboring states. As of now, at least 935 cases of measles have been confirmed in the US this year, with over 1,000 cases reported in Canada. The high hospitalization rate and unusual severity of the current outbreak suggest that many mild cases may be going undetected. 'We recommend that anyone who believes they may have been exposed to measles contact their healthcare provider before seeking medical attention,' said the health department. 'It's also essential to stay up-to-date with vaccinations to prevent the spread of the virus.'

**Measles cases have now spread to 30 states**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,024 cases of measles across the U.S., with 14 outbreaks in 30 states. The majority of cases have been reported in Texas, with 722 confirmed cases, and New Mexico has the second-highest number of cases. According to the CDC, 13% of cases have resulted in hospitalization, and there have been three deaths. The American Public Health Association has criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for promoting 'unscientific theories' and downplaying the significance of the measles resurgence. Kennedy has since endorsed the MMR vaccine as the 'most effective way to prevent the spread' of measles.

**Texas measles outbreak grows slightly, topping 720 cases**
The Texas measles outbreak has grown to 722 cases, with only four new cases reported since last week. Health officials stated that less than 1% of the confirmed cases are 'actively infectious.' Since the outbreak began in late January, over 90 people have been hospitalized and two unvaccinated school-aged children have died. The majority of the cases, 406, are still in Gaines County. Health experts emphasize that measles spreads primarily among unvaccinated people and recommend the two-dose MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective at preventing the illness.

**Taiwan Reports 2 New Measles Cases Imported from Vietnam, Highest Number in 6 Years**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that there were 2 new cases of measles imported from Vietnam last week, both of which were men in their 30s from the northern and central regions. They had traveled to Vietnam in late April and early May and developed symptoms 4 and 9 days after returning to Taiwan, respectively. The CDC stated that the recent measles cluster event in Taiwan has ended, as the monitoring period ended on May 14th with no new domestic cases. According to the CDC, Taiwan has reported 36 cases of measles as of May 19th this year, with 12 cases being domestic infections and 24 cases being imported from Vietnam, which is the highest number of cases in the past 6 years. The CDC also noted that the international measles situation is severe, with Vietnam reporting over 81,000 cases as of late April and continuing to report deaths. The United States has reported over 1,000 cases in 31 states as of May 15th, with Texas reporting over 700 cases. Canada has reported over 1,800 cases in 9 provinces as of early May, with Ontario and Alberta reporting significant increases. Mexico's Chihuahua state has reported 1,400 cases, making it the country's most severe outbreak area. At least 16 European countries have reported measles outbreaks, with Romania reporting over 6,400 cases and 8 deaths as of April 30th, making it the most severe outbreak in the region.

**Measles Outbreak Spreads to 30 US States, Chicago Activates Health Alert**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed over 1,000 cases of measles since March 2025, with the outbreak centered in Texas and spreading to at least 30 states. Chicago has activated a health alert after a possible case was reported at O'Hare International Airport, one of the country's busiest airports. According to the Daily Mail, a person infected with the virus was at Terminal 1 of the airport between April 22 and 23, exposing hundreds of people to the virus. The person was isolated at home after diagnosis and later voluntarily admitted to a local hospital on April 28. The outbreak has also affected other public spaces in Chicago, including a public library, a healthy food restaurant, and two gas stations. Authorities have asked those who came into contact with the patient to consult their doctors and monitor for symptoms. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread through the air and remain active for hours, with symptoms including high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a characteristic rash. The spread of the virus has been fueled by vaccine hesitancy, with some communities and public figures contributing to the misinformation. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current US Secretary of Health, has been criticized for his past anti-vaccine rhetoric, despite stating in a Senate hearing on January 29 that 'I will not do anything as Secretary of Health that would discourage or dissuade people from receiving any of those vaccines.' However, the US has reduced funding for these programs.

**US surpasses 1,000 measles cases, Texas reports low count of new cases**
The United States has surpassed 1,000 cases of measles, according to Telemundo, despite Texas reporting one of its lowest counts of new confirmed cases since the outbreak began three months ago. Texas still concentrates the majority of cases in the US, with 709 confirmed cases as of Friday in an outbreak that has also spread measles to New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Two unvaccinated elementary school children died from measles-related illnesses in the epicenter of western Texas, and an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico died from a measles-related illness. Other states with active outbreaks (defined by the CDC as three or more related cases) include Indiana, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. 'We are concerned that the virus is spreading in communities with low vaccination rates,' said Dr. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary of Health. 'We fear that the spread of the virus may continue for a year.' The measles virus is highly contagious and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. It can be prevented by vaccination and is considered eradicated in the US since 2000. As the virus takes hold in US communities with low vaccination rates, health experts worry that the spread may continue for a year. In Texas, there are a total of 709 cases in 29 counties, mostly in the western part of the state, reported by state health authorities on Friday. The state confirmed only seven new cases since its update on Tuesday. The state also added a hospitalization to its count, for a total of 92 during the outbreak. Health authorities estimated that around 1% of cases (less than 10) are contagious. The 57% of cases in Texas are concentrated in Gaines County, with a population of 22,892, where the virus began to spread in an unvaccinated and closely-knit community. The county has registered 403 cases since late January, representing more than 1.7% of its residents. The death on April 3 in Texas was that of an 8-year-old child, according to Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health authorities reported that the child had no underlying conditions and died from 'what his doctor described as measles-induced respiratory failure.' An unvaccinated child without underlying conditions died of measles in Texas at the end of February; Kennedy indicated that the child was 6 years old. New Mexico added four cases on Friday, for a total of 71. Seven people have been hospitalized since the start of the outbreak. Most cases in the state are located in Lea County. Three cases are in Eddy County, two in Doña Ana County, and one in Chaves County. Curry County registered its first case this week. An unvaccinated adult died on March 6 due to a measles-related illness. The person did not seek medical attention.

**Anti-Vaccination Movement Blamed for Measles Outbreak in Michoacán**
The intensification of the anti-vaccination movement has facilitated the spread of diseases like measles, which was previously under control in the state of Michoacán. According to the Michoacán Health Secretariat (SSM), since 1992, the state had not registered any indigenous cases of measles. However, the anti-vaccination movement that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the spread of the disease again. Dr. Fabio Silahua, head of the Epidemiology Department of the SSM, stated that the three cases of measles detected in Maravatío correspond to three unvaccinated siblings, aged 15, 6, and 3 years, who attended a party with people from another country. 'The measles is present in the United States, in Texas, in Canada, and it seems that they came from both countries. These children were not vaccinated because their father did not want to vaccinate them, due to all these myths, the father decided not to vaccinate them; the COVID affected that part, because most of the attention was dedicated to vaccinating COVID and from there emerged many anti-vaccination groups,' he said. The SSM has implemented a blockade of 61 blocks around the area, reviewing vaccination cards and searching for possible cases, but so far, no more cases have been found. Silahua urged the population to comply with the universal vaccination program, as this will help contain diseases like measles and pertussis, which have registered outbreaks in recent months.

**Measles Case Confirmed in Montreal: Public Health Alert - World Today News**
A public health alert has been issued in Montreal after a contagious individual with measles was present in the area from May 4-7. The alert lists several locations where the individual may have exposed others, including the Quality Inn Dorval, RPA château Pierrefonds, Non-Solo Bakery, Tacos Frida, Bar Messorem, and a Subway restaurant in Kirkland. According to Dr. Marina Salvadori, Canada could lose its status as a measles-free country if the disease continues to spread beyond mid-October 2025. However, she remains optimistic that measles can be eliminated again in the country. It is recommended to check vaccination records and contact a healthcare provider for guidance if unsure of measles immunity.

**Measles Cases in US Reach New Record, Outbreak in Texas and Neighboring States Worsens**
The weekly cases of measles in the United States have reached a new record, surpassing even the maximum recorded during the 2019 outbreak, considered the worst since the 1990s. According to data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday, the number of cases with symptoms initiated during the week of March 30 reached 111. This figure exceeds the 102 cases reported in the week of March 23, 2019, at the peak of that outbreak. The current outbreak is centered in Texas and neighboring states, with at least 750 cases linked to this focus, as reported by CBS News. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, explained that while new cases in the region appear to have decreased, it is premature to declare that the outbreak is concluding. 'We observe trends over time and would like to see several weeks of decline. Sometimes new cases are reported to authorities up to a week after someone gets tested, especially if the analysis was done in commercial labs,' Anton explained. Experts and authorities have warned that the actual number of cases could be higher than reported, due to unrecorded infections. The unusually high severity of the outbreak suggests that many mild cases may be going undiagnosed or unnoticed. In comparison, according to the CDC report, at least 935 cases have been counted in the United States this year, while in Canada, authorities have confirmed over 1,000. The hospitalization rate also differs between the two countries, with 13% of cases resulting in hospitalizations in the US, compared to 7% in Canada. Additionally, three measles-related deaths have been reported in the US this year, while Canada has not reported any fatalities. CBS News noted that 'these figures illustrate the magnitude and severity of the current outbreak,' especially considering that in previous years, deaths have been extremely rare. Measles, a highly contagious disease, can have severe complications, especially in unvaccinated populations. The recent spread reinforces the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states is a warning sign of how the disease can resurge in areas where adequate immunization is not achieved. Health authorities continue to monitor the outbreak's progress with the goal of containing its spread.

**CDC Provides Update on Measles Outbreak in the United States - Physician's Weekly**
According to the CDC, a multistate measles outbreak has been reported in the United States, mainly affecting close-knit communities with low measles vaccination coverage in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. As of April 17, 2025, there have been 800 reported cases, an increase of 180% from the 285 cases reported in 2024. The outbreak has resulted in 85 hospitalizations and 3 deaths. The CDC notes that recent global measles incidence, declining vaccination coverage in the US, and spread of measles from domestic outbreaks have increased the risk for ongoing transmission within the US. 'Recent increasing global measles incidence in areas frequently visited by U.S. travelers, coupled with declines in measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination coverage in many U.S. jurisdictions to <95 percent (the estimated population-level immunity necessary to prevent measles outbreaks), and spread of measles from ongoing domestic outbreaks to other jurisdictions, have increased the risk for ongoing measles transmission within the United States,' the authors write.

**The latest on measles outbreak cases in the U.S.**
The United States is experiencing a large measles outbreak centered in West Texas, with cases spilling over to more states. According to the CDC, two unvaccinated and otherwise healthy school-aged children have died in Texas, and an unvaccinated adult has died in New Mexico. The outbreak is mainly among unvaccinated children, with most cases in the Texas region. The CDC estimates that 95 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated with two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent measles outbreaks. As of April 22, 2025, vaccination rates for kindergartners vary by state, with data showing a significant gap in vaccination rates among unvaccinated children.

**Measles Outbreak Spreads Across US, Half of States Report Cases**
At least 800 cases of measles have been reported in the United States this year, with half of the states reporting cases, according to a count by CNN. The majority of cases are concentrated in a multistate outbreak involving Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and possibly Kansas, which has reported 709 cases as of Friday, according to state health department updates. Experts say that these numbers are a severe undercount because many cases are not being reported. The multistate outbreak has put 69 people in the hospital in Texas, New Mexico, and Kansas, five more since Tuesday's update. Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that at least 85 people have been hospitalized, representing 11% of confirmed cases. Local health officials are struggling to increase vaccinations, especially in communities with low vaccination coverage. Katherine Wells, Director of Public Health in Lubbock, Texas, said that clinics in Lubbock have administered 450 more doses of the MMR vaccine than usual this time of year. Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at the CDC, warned that the growth of numbers could threaten the country's elimination status if the outbreak continues. 'That would happen after 12 months of continuous circulation of the same sequence,' he said. 'That would be around January 20, 2026.' Two children in Texas have died in the current multistate outbreak, and a third death in New Mexico is under investigation. All three were unvaccinated.

**Measles Outbreak in Texas: A Preventable Tragedy and the Urgent Need for Vaccination**
A recent measles outbreak in Texas, the worst in three decades, highlights the urgent need for vaccination. Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads easily, and when an infected person coughs or sneezes, the virus can remain in the air for up to two hours. As of late February 2025, Texas has reported 124 cases, primarily among children, with one confirmed fatality. The outbreak underscores the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates, particularly as immunization levels have declined since the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Syra Madad, 'In a world with safe and effective vaccines, no child should suffer -- or lose their life -- to a disease we have the power to prevent.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that one in five measles cases leads to hospitalization, one in 20 develops pneumonia, and one to three per 1,000 may result in death. 'Measles weakens the immune system, erasing immunological memory and increasing susceptibility to other infections,' Madad writes. The key points to be aware of include declining vaccination rates, international travel, and pockets of unvaccinated communities. 'These alarming trends undermine herd immunity and heighten the risk of outbreaks,' Madad warns.

**Measles Outbreak in Texas Triggers Vaccination Campaign**
A measles outbreak in the southern United States has prompted a vaccination campaign in Lubbock, Texas. The outbreak has resulted in the death of an unvaccinated child, the first in the country in nearly 10 years. Mark Medina, a 31-year-old father, said, 'We were a little scared after learning about it on Facebook. We thought, 'Okay, it's time to get vaccinated.' ' The epicenter of the outbreak is in a county with a large Mennonite population, who traditionally do not vaccinate their children. Rachel Dolan, a public health official, said, 'Measles is very contagious, it's the most contagious virus we know.' Since the beginning of the year, 146 cases have been reported in Texas, with 20 people recently hospitalized. Experts are concerned about the influence of new Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr, who has previously spread misinformation about vaccines. The outbreak has also coincided with a growing trend of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children, fueled by distrust of health authorities and pharmaceutical companies. However, the news of the child's death has had an 'electroshock' effect, with many parents deciding to get vaccinated. Rachel Dolan said, 'We've seen an increase in people coming to get vaccinated as the outbreak has grown.' 'Some people have realized the immediacy of the threat and have decided to get vaccinated,' she added. After two doses, the vaccine's efficacy against measles is 97%, one of the highest rates among available vaccines, according to Dolan.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Texas Tribune (May 16, 2025)**: Recent, credible reporting from a major Texas news outlet. Reports approximately 500 cumulative cases statewide, with 9 new cases in the past week (lowest since February). Geographical information is detailed, noting the South Plains region as the outbreak center with multiple counties affected. Cited health officials provide factual recommendations about vaccination.

2. **CIDRAP (April 4, 2025)**: Highly credible source from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Reports 481 total Texas cases since January with 59 new cases on April 4, spanning 19 counties. Also reports 56 hospitalizations and that 471 cases involved unvaccinated individuals. Data is well-sourced from state health departments.

3. **Johns Hopkins (March 12, 2025)**: Authoritative academic source. Reports 223 Texas cases (156 in Gaines County) as of March 11, with 29 hospitalizations and 1 death. Contextualizes the outbreak in a low-vaccination Mennonite community. Contains expert factual analysis about vaccine efficacy and transmission patterns.

4. **Texas Public Radio (May 9, 2025)**: Reliable regional news source. Reports 709 total cases in the West Texas outbreak, with 7 new cases since their previous Tuesday update. Reports 92 hospitalizations and eight counties with ongoing transmission. Contains specific exposure location information.

5. **CIDRAP (April 25, 2025)**: Reports 646 cases in the West Texas outbreak (22 new since April 22), spanning 26 counties. Notes Gaines County accounts for ~60% of state cases, and mentions 29 additional cases under investigation.

6. **NBC News (May 16, 2025)**: Major national news outlet reporting Texas accounts for approximately two-thirds of 1,000+ national cases (suggesting ~667 Texas cases). Provides historical context for measles outbreaks pre-elimination.

The most reliable case count appears to be the 709 figure from TPR on May 9, as it provides the most specific recent figure consistent with the trend observed in other reports, though there's some discrepancy with the Texas Tribune's figure.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Potential reference classes:
1. **Historical Texas measles outbreaks**: Limited historical data is provided, though the Tribune notes this is the largest outbreak in 30 years.
   
2. **Recent U.S. measles outbreaks**: The 2019 outbreak with 1,274 national cases provides some context, with about 900 cases concentrated in a single low-vaccination community.
   
3. **Current outbreak trajectory**: We have multiple data points over several months showing the growth and recent deceleration of this specific outbreak.

The most suitable reference class is the current outbreak trajectory, as we have multiple recent data points showing a clear deceleration pattern, and this outbreak has specific characteristics (centered in West Texas Mennonite communities) that make it more relevant than historical patterns.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is from May 21, 2025 (today) to July 1, 2025 (41 days).

Examining the historical pattern:
- March 11 to April 4: 258 new cases in 24 days (≈10.75 cases/day)
- April 4 to April 25: 165 new cases in 21 days (≈7.86 cases/day)
- April 25 to May 9: 63 new cases in 14 days (≈4.5 cases/day)
- May 9 to May 16: Approximately 9 new cases in 7 days (≈1.29 cases/day)

This shows a clear deceleration in the outbreak, with the most recent weekly total being "the fewest since February" according to the Texas Tribune.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the most specific recent count of 709 cases as of May 9, we can project forward using the observed deceleration pattern. Key considerations:

1. The daily new case rate has steadily declined from ~10.75 in March to ~1.29 by mid-May.
2. While the outbreak is clearly decelerating, measles is highly contagious and could resurge if it reaches new unvaccinated populations.
3. The outbreak has already spread to at least 26 counties, including urban areas like Houston.
4. Declining vaccination rates in Texas over the past four years (mentioned by Texas Tribune) create vulnerability for continued spread.
5. The outbreak's geographical expansion pattern suggests potential for continued spread, albeit at a slower rate.

If we estimate the current daily new case rate at ~1.3-1.5 cases/day for the remaining 41 days until July 1, we would expect approximately 53-62 additional cases. This would bring the total to around 765-775 cases.

However, I must account for both additional deceleration and potential resurgence. The deceleration pattern shows progressively stronger containment, but the geographic spread and low vaccination rates present risk factors for continued transmission.

## Outside view calibration:

Based on the clear pattern of deceleration (27% decrease over 3 weeks, then 43% decrease over 2 weeks, then 71% decrease over 1 week), the outbreak appears to be coming under control. Epidemic curves typically show a more gradual decline after the peak than during the initial rise.

For my percentile estimates:
- Lower percentiles (10-20th): Represent scenarios where the outbreak continues its strong deceleration, with minimal new cases.
- Middle percentiles (40-60th): Represent scenarios with continued slow spread at the current reduced rate.
- Higher percentiles (80-90th): Represent scenarios where the outbreak finds new pockets of unvaccinated individuals and experiences some degree of resurgence.

Starting from ~709 cases on May 9, with approximately 15 more cases by May 21 (at ~1.29/day), we're at approximately 724 cases today. From May 21 to July 1 (41 days), continued spread at the current rate would add about 53 more cases, for a total of ~777.

The hint that the answer is expected to be above 717 confirms we should expect at least some additional cases beyond the May figures. The upper bound hint of 2000 suggests significant resurgence is unlikely but possible.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Texas Tribune (May 16, 2025)**
   - Recent, high-quality source (5 days old)
   - Reports ~500 cumulative cases statewide with 9 new cases in the past week
   - Geographic focus in South Plains/West Texas with ~150 cases in a Mennonite community
   - Notable factual information: Largest outbreak in 30 years; declining weekly cases; spread to neighboring states
   - Expert opinions: Health officials recommend vaccination as the best prevention method

2. **CIDRAP report (April 4, 2025)**
   - Respected epidemiology center but data is ~7 weeks old
   - Reports 481 Texas cases with 59 new cases on April 4
   - 97% of cases occurred in unvaccinated people or those with unknown status
   - Cases spread across 19 counties

3. **Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (March 12, 2025)**
   - Authoritative public health institution but data is ~10 weeks old
   - Reports 223 Texas cases by March 11 (156 in Gaines County)
   - Provides valuable context on transmission dynamics and community factors

4. **TPR (Texas Public Radio) (May 9, 2025)**
   - Recent data (~2 weeks old)
   - Reports ~709 total cases in the West Texas outbreak
   - 92 hospitalizations
   - 8 counties with ongoing transmission identified

5. **CIDRAP report (April 25, 2025)**
   - ~4 weeks old
   - Reports 646 cases in West Texas outbreak
   - 26 counties affected

6. **NBC News (May 16, 2025)**
   - Recent but lacks specific Texas numbers
   - States Texas accounts for roughly two-thirds of 1,000+ US cases in 2025
   - Provides historical context on measles outbreaks

The most recent and reliable data points indicate:
- ~709 cases as of May 9 (TPR)
- 7 new cases between May 7-9 (TPR)
- 9 new cases in the week before May 16 (Texas Tribune)

Note: The Texas Tribune's ~500 cumulative cases appears inconsistent with TPR's ~709 cases. Given the chronological progression in other sources, the higher figure seems more reliable.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Possible reference classes:

1. **Current outbreak trajectory in Texas**
   - Most directly relevant
   - Multiple data points from March through May 2025
   - Shows clear deceleration pattern

2. **Similar community outbreaks**
   - 2019 outbreak: 1,274 US cases, ~900 in NY Orthodox Jewish community
   - 2014 outbreak: 383 cases in Ohio Amish community

3. **Regional spread patterns**
   - Spread from initial Gaines County focus to 26+ counties
   - Expansion into neighboring states (New Mexico: 66 cases, Oklahoma: 15 cases)

The most suitable reference class is the current outbreak trajectory, as we have direct observational data on its growth pattern, supplemented by insights from similar community outbreaks for context.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Forecasting for July 1, 2025 = 41 days from today (May 21, 2025).

Analyzing growth trends:
- March 11 to April 4 (24 days): 258 new cases (~10.75/day)
- April 4 to April 25 (21 days): 165 new cases (~7.86/day)
- April 25 to May 9 (14 days): 63 new cases (~4.5/day)
- May 9 to May 16 (7 days): ~9 new cases (~1.29/day)

This shows a clear deceleration pattern, from ~10.75 cases/day in March to ~1.29 cases/day in mid-May.

## (d) Justification for Outside View Prediction

I'm starting with the most reliable recent count of ~709 cases (May 9, 2025) and projecting forward 53 days to July 1.

Key factors influencing the forecast:

1. **Demonstrated deceleration**: The daily new case rate has steadily fallen from ~10.75/day (March) to ~1.29/day (mid-May).

2. **Vaccination campaigns and interventions**: Texas has spent $4.5 million on immunization campaigns, testing, and awareness, which should continue to reduce transmission.

3. **Seasonal/institutional factors**: School closures for summer may further reduce transmission among children (a primary affected group).

4. **Geographic spread risk**: While initially concentrated in Gaines County, the outbreak has reached 26+ counties, including urban areas, potentially introducing new transmission chains.

5. **Herd dynamics**: Most susceptible individuals in the originally affected communities may have already been infected, naturally slowing growth there.

6. **Reporting considerations**: The July 1 date may include retrospective case additions or data corrections not captured in daily reporting.

Based on these factors, I expect continued but slowing growth, with the most likely outcome being approximately 830-850 total cases by July 1, 2025.

## Outside view calibration:

I'll calibrate my prediction by examining different scenarios:

- **Optimistic scenario** (~730-760 cases): The outbreak continues its strong deceleration, with new cases diminishing to near zero by late June. Public health measures are highly effective and no significant new clusters emerge.

- **Moderate scenario** (~800-850 cases): Deceleration continues but at a moderate pace, with 2-3 new cases per day on average. Small new clusters emerge but are quickly contained.

- **Pessimistic scenario** (~900-950 cases): Several new clusters emerge in previously unaffected counties, or case detection improves to identify previously missed cases. Daily new cases remain steady at 4-5 per day.

- **Very pessimistic scenario** (~1000+ cases): Major new clusters emerge, possibly in densely populated areas like Harris County (Houston), reversing the deceleration trend.

Given the current deceleration pattern and public health response, I'm weighting more toward the moderate-to-optimistic scenarios, while acknowledging the possibility of unexpected developments in either direction.

The hint that the answer is expected to be above 717.0 aligns with this analysis, as even the most optimistic scenario projects above this number given the current ~709 count plus inevitable additional cases over the next 41 days.

# Outside view calibration:

My calibration is based primarily on the observed deceleration trend, while accounting for uncertainties including:

1. The possibility of new clusters emerging, particularly in urban areas
2. Potential reporting adjustments or retrospective case additions
3. The effectiveness of ongoing public health interventions
4. Seasonal factors including school closures and summer travel patterns
5. The remaining susceptible population in affected communities

I'm calibrating toward a right-skewed distribution to reflect that outbreaks can occasionally accelerate unexpectedly, while acknowledging the strong evidence for continued deceleration.

Starting from the current ~715 cases (adding the most recent reported new cases to the ~709 figure), I expect:
- ~730-750 cases (minimal additional spread) at the lower end
- ~850 cases as the most likely outcome (continued moderate deceleration)
- ~1000+ cases at the upper end (if significant new clusters emerge)

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   – Texas Tribune (May 16): quality medium, grounded in DSHS weekly report. Reports 9 new cases in last week, cumulative statewide ≈500. Factual on counts; occasional expert opinion on vaccination messaging.  
   – CIDRAP (Apr 4): high quality, cites CDC and TDSHS. Texas total 481 as of early April, 59 new “today.” Solid.  
   – Johns Hopkins (Mar 12): high quality, academic analysis of dynamics in low-vax Mennonite community; totals (223 by Mar 11) reliable.  
   – TPR (May 9): medium quality, pulls from DSHS updates—7 new cases since last Tuesday; West Texas outbreak total ≈709.  
   – CIDRAP (Apr 25): high quality, reports West Texas outbreak at 646 (Apr 25) and spread to 26 counties; solid for trend.  
   – NBC News (May 16): medium quality aggregator; Texas ≈ two-thirds of >1,000 US cases.  

   We treat the CDC/TDSHS figures as factual baselines; expert quotes (e.g., on messaging) noted but not directly predictive.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
   – US community‐specific measles outbreaks in vaccine‐hesitant pockets:  
     • 2019 NY Orthodox Jewish: ~900 cases over ~4 months in one metro area.  
     • 2014 Ohio Amish: ~383 cases in ~3 months.  
   – Suitability: our West Texas outbreak shares low-vax community dynamics but is larger and more geographically diffuse than the Ohio case, smaller than 2019 NY but spread across multiple counties.  
   – Most similar: large rural multi-county outbreaks (extrapolating 2014 Ohio → 383; adding spillover). We expect a plateau in the low-vax networks once susceptibles are depleted.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Today is May 21, resolution on July 1: 41 days ahead.  
   – Weekly growth rates have declined:  
     • Mar 4→Mar 11: +64 (∼9/day)  
     • Apr 4→Apr 25: +165 in 21 days (∼8/day)  
     • Apr 25→May 9: +63 in 14 days (∼4.5/day)  
     • May 9→May 16: +9 in 7 days (∼1.3/day)  
   – Recent data imply a late-phase (sub-exponential) growth, ~1–2 cases/day.  

4. Justification & outside‐view baseline  
   – Current statewide cumulative: average of DSHS‐based sources suggests ~720 cases as of mid‐May.  
   – At 1.3–2 cases/day for 41 days, naive projection adds ~53–82 cases → total ≈773–802 by July 1.  
   – However, unexpected spillovers, reporting lags, and potential new clusters could push totals higher (perhaps up to ~1,200–1,500).  
   – Reference outbreaks plateaued around 1× initial surge size; our initial surge was ≈300 by early March → plateau perhaps ~1,000.  
   – Status quo reopening, low trust, legislative resistance to mandates argue for a slower but persistent trickle of cases.  

Outside view calibration:  
   – We anchor the distribution on a central projection ≈800 but allow heavy upper tail to capture “second‐wave” spillovers and undercounting.  
   – Tether to known outbreak peaks: Ohio (~383) vs. New York (~900); Texas likely between 700 and 1,500.  
   – Set 90/10 interval wide to reflect community‐specific dynamics and reporting uncertainties.  
   – Account for occasional surprises: about 10–20% chance of a larger than +100% overshoot relative to central forecast in US measles outbreaks.

Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. Texas Tribune (May 16): high‐quality regional journalism. Reports “about 500” cumulative statewide but may track only South Plains area. Factual. Opinions limited to public‐health experts urging vaccination.  
   b. CIDRAP (April 4 & April 25): reputable university‐linked news service citing CDC and state health departments. Early April: Texas 481 cases; late April: West Texas outbreak 646 cases. Factual, no strong editorial slant.  
   c. Johns Hopkins Bloomberg (March 12): authoritative academic analysis. Reports 223 Texas cases by early March. Factual, with vetted transmission/control commentary.  
   d. TPR (May 9): statewide public radio. Reports 709 cases in West Texas by May 9. Factual but focused on outbreak region; hospitalization/death details added.  
   e. NBC News (May 16): aggregates state reports. Puts US cases >1,000, two‐thirds in Texas (~667). Factual synthesis, updated biweekly.  
   f. Perplexity (failed): no usable data.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
   • 2019 U.S. measles surge: 1,274 total cases, ~900 concentrated in one community. Analogous because driven by pockets of low vaccination.  
   • 2014 Ohio Amish outbreak: ~383 cases statewide. Smaller scale but similar community dynamics.  
   • Texas 30‐year precedent? Small past outbreaks (<100 cases) in 1990s.  
   Most suitable reference class: large, modern US outbreaks (2019) in under-vaccinated subpopulations. Texas’s 2025 proportion (~2/3 of national) aligns with 2019 pattern (NY Orthodox Jewish community).  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Forecast date to resolution: ~41 days (May 21→July 1).  
   • Outbreak start to now: ~100 days (late January→May). Growth curve:  
     – Early phase (Jan–Mar): exponential doubling every ~2–3 weeks.  
     – Mid phase (Mar–Apr): ~223→646 cases in ~6 weeks (~70 new/week).  
     – Late phase (Apr–May): growth slowed to ~9–12 new cases/week.  
   • Similar older outbreaks peaked ~3–4 months in and then tapered once public‐health measures took hold.  

4. Justification for outside view  
   a. Baseline (status quo) projection: continuing at the recent slower pace of ~10 new cases/week yields +50 cases by July 1. Adding to today’s implied ~720 gives ~770 cases.  
   b. Upside risks (upper tail):  
      – Further geographic spread into new counties with low vaccination.  
      – Reduced compliance with quarantine/vaccine drives.  
      – Could add ~200–300 more cases (as in early phase).  
   c. Downside risks (lower tail):  
      – Intensified targeted vaccination and quarantine rapidly halts chain.  
      – Might see as few as +20–30 cases.  
   d. Expert/market expectations: no commercial market, but public‐health messaging indicates containment is achievable but challenging; experts project a plateau near 800.  
   e. Historical upset rate: US measles forecasts often undershoot tail surges, so broaden tails moderately.  

Outside view calibration  
• Tie to 2019 outbreak: Texas’s share of US cases is currently ~2/3; if 2025 US ends near 1,200–1,500, Texas likely ends near 800–1,000.  
• Use an S‐curve shaped distribution: heavy density around 750–850, modest tails to 700 and 1,100.  
• Allow a 90/10 interval ~720–950 to capture containment success vs. moderate resurgence.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Texas Tribune (16 May 2025).  Latest press account that quotes the twice-weekly DSHS line-list.  Factual portions (cumulative caseload ≈ 500, weekly increase = 9) come from the state bulletin of 15 May.  Reporter commentary about political headwinds is opinion.  Good quality, very fresh.  
• TPR (Texas Public Radio) (09 May 2025).  Pulls numbers directly from the same DSHS spreadsheet (709 outbreak cases, 92 hospitalisations).  One-week older than the Tribune but still official data.  
• CIDRAP (04 Apr & 25 Apr 2025).  Academic news service that distils CDC and DSHS tables (Texas = 481 on 04 Apr; 646 on 25 Apr).  High factual reliability; two to seven weeks old.  
• Johns Hopkins BSPH explainer (12 Mar 2025).  Background on index community, transmission maths.  Good for mechanistic context, but counts are far out-of-date.  
• NBC News dashboard (16 May 2025).  Aggregates state dashboards twice weekly; gives national framing (Texas ≈ two-thirds of > 1 000 U.S. cases).  Reliable for totals, not for fine-grained trend.  
• Perplexity report failed – ignored.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates  
1. Texas-only 2013-2024 annual measles totals (range 0-32; median = 2).  Poor fit: present outbreak already two orders of magnitude larger.  
2. Other U.S. state-level “contained” outbreaks since 2000 (e.g., 2014 Ohio Amish = 383; 2019 New York Orthodox Jewish community = ~ 900).  Closer in scale and sociological profile.  
3. Epidemic tail of the same 2025 Texas outbreak (current situation).  Best because we are only 6 weeks from resolution and > 95 % of the eventual July 1 total has already occurred.  Chosen reference class.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Days to resolution: 41 (six epidemiological weeks; about 3 full measles serial intervals).  
• Historical pattern for similar U.S. community-centred outbreaks:  
  – Growth phase of 6-10 serial intervals, then sustained decline as ring-vaccination and natural immunity kick in.  
  – Tail usually adds 10-25 % to cumulative total after the peak week.  
• Peak in Texas occurred mid-April (DSHS: 59 cases added on 04 Apr update; weekly new ≈ 125 late-March).  Since then, weekly additions have fallen: 22 → 9 cases.  We appear 4-5 serial intervals past the peak.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
Starting point: The most recent official spreadsheet (Tuesday 20 May) lists 732 confirmed 2025 Texas cases.  
Baseline growth: Use an exponential decay in weekly incidence with half-life ≈ 2 weeks (consistent with post-peak data: 125 → 60 → 30 → 15 → 9).  
Projecting forward:  

Week ending  New cases (mean)  Cumulative  
25 May    ≈ 20       752  
01 Jun    ≈ 15       767  
08 Jun    ≈ 11       778  
15 Jun    ≈ 8       786  
22 Jun    ≈ 6       792  
29 Jun    ≈ 5       797  
Residual stragglers reported on 01 Jul bulletin + 8 (reporting lag, imports) → point estimate ≈ 805.

Upside drivers (producing > 900)  
• A fresh seeding event in a large metro pocket with sub-90 % MMR coverage (Houston, Dallas) that has not yet surfaced.  
• Reporting artefact: backlog dump or broadened case definition.  
Downside drivers (< 760)  
• Outbreak truly snuffed; only single-digit additions each week; no large backlogs.

History of U.S. measles surprise jumps: out-of-the-blue secondary surges rare but not impossible (2019 NYC saw a second hump that added ≈ 20 %).  Given only six weeks remain, tail-risk is moderate, not huge.

Outside view calibration:
• Central 50 % range (40th-60th percentiles) placed around 830 ± 50.  
• 80 % and 90 % tails widened to capture the low-probability flare-up scenario.  
• 10 % tail kept at 750, acknowledging that reported statewide total is already 732 and could plateau almost immediately.  
Distribution skew: mild right-skew; hard lower bound only a little below present value, whereas upper tail stretches to ~ 1100 before the 90th percentile hits Metaculus hint ceiling of 2000.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth (May 20, 2025)**: Very recent, reliable reporting with specific figures - 722 total cases statewide since January, with just 4 new cases in the latest update. Details county-level breakdown, with Gaines County remaining at 406 cases (56% of total). States 95% of cases (688) were unvaccinated individuals. Attributes data to Texas Health and Human Services.

**CDC Report (May 16, 2025)**: Authoritative health agency reporting 1,024 national cases across 31 jurisdictions. Shows 13% hospitalization rate, with higher rates among children under 5. Provides valuable national context but lacks Texas-specific breakdown.

**CIDRAP (May 13, 2025)**: Highly credible infectious disease research center reporting 717 Texas cases spanning 32 counties, plus 15 cases not connected to the West Texas outbreak. Notes two counties were removed from "active transmission" list after no new cases for two incubation periods.

**Houston Chronicle (April 23, 2025)**: Older but contains valuable expert opinions from epidemiologists at UTHealth, UT Austin, and Texas A&M. Dr. Catherine Troisi estimated "at least a 50% chance" of reaching 1,000+ cases by early summer. Reports ~50 new cases weekly since mid-February, with surge in March.

**Recent Asknews Articles**: Multiple May 20-21 sources (Dallas Morning News, Independent) confirm 722 cases with minimal recent growth. May 9 Telemundo report showed 709 cases with 7 new cases that week, demonstrating consistent deceleration.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **Case count deceleration pattern** (multiple independent sources): From ~50 weekly cases in February-March to just 4 in past week.
- **Geographic concentration remains stable**: 56% of cases in Gaines County (406/722), indicating limited geographic expansion.
- **Vaccination status correlation**: 95% of cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals, creating natural firewall for spread.
- **Actively infectious cases declining**: "Fewer than 10" cases currently infectious per Texas HHS, limiting transmission potential.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Counties removed from outbreak list**: Garza, Lynn, and Dallam counties show successful containment in some areas.
- **Historical outbreak patterns**: Previous Texas outbreaks (1990-1992) show eventual containment after peaks.
- **Hospitalization data**: 92 hospitalizations in outbreak (per FOX 4), suggesting steady rather than dramatically increasing severity.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Expert opinions from April**: Predictions from experts were made when the outbreak was still accelerating.
- **Potential for underreporting**: Suggestion that some cases may not be captured in official counts.
- **International context**: Global measles resurgence continues (Vietnam, Romania noted in Taiwan news article).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is 41 days (May 21, 2025 to July 1, 2025).

If the timeframe were halved (20-21 days), we would expect fewer additional cases (~10-15) since the outbreak is decelerating. The prediction would likely be around 735-740 cases.

If the timeframe were doubled (82 days), uncertainty would increase substantially. While current trajectory suggests continued deceleration, a longer window provides more opportunity for either (a) the outbreak to be nearly contained with only occasional new cases, or (b) the virus to find new pockets of susceptible individuals, resulting in new clusters. The prediction range would widen, with the upper bound potentially reaching 900-1,000 cases.

## (d) Justification

Starting with our current count of 722 cases (May 20, 2025), I need to project forward 41 days.

**Factors supporting continued deceleration:**
1. The outbreak has shown consistent deceleration, from ~50 cases weekly in February-March to just 4 new cases in the past week.
2. Fewer than 10 active infectious cases currently exist.
3. The geographic concentration remains stable (56% in Gaines County).
4. The removal of three counties from the "active transmission" list demonstrates successful containment efforts.
5. The 95% correlation with unvaccinated status suggests limited potential to spread in vaccinated populations.

**Factors suggesting potential for continued spread:**
1. Measles is highly contagious (90% infection rate among susceptible contacts).
2. The virus has already spread to 32 counties across Texas.
3. The national measles resurgence continues (1,024+ cases in 31 states).
4. Multiple states reported funding cuts affecting vaccination campaigns (Stateline article).
5. The HHS Secretary's statement that "the spread of the virus may continue for a year" (per Telemundo).

**Synthesis:**
The evidence strongly indicates an outbreak that has peaked and is now in steady decline. At the current rate of ~4 new cases weekly, we would expect approximately 23-24 more cases by July 1, for a total of ~745-746.

However, the right tail risk remains significant due to measles' contagiousness and the possibility of finding new susceptible populations. The baseline expectation should be continued deceleration, but with allowance for potential occasional clusters that could increase the total more substantially.

## Probability Calibration

Starting with our current count of 722, I'll project forward 41 days based on the observed deceleration pattern:

At the current rate of ~4 new cases weekly, we would expect ~24 more cases by July 1, for a total of 746. This forms my median estimate.

The distribution should reflect:
- Lower percentiles: Scenarios where deceleration continues and strengthens (few new cases)
- Middle percentiles: Scenarios with continued slow spread at current reduced rates
- Upper percentiles: Scenarios where new clusters emerge in previously unaffected areas
- Extreme upper percentiles: Scenarios with significant resurgence finding new susceptible populations

The distribution is right-skewed due to the asymmetric risk - there's more potential for unexpected upside surprises than downside (cases can't go below 722).

## Checklist:
1. Target variable: Number of measles cases Texas will report on July 1, 2025, per Texas Health & Human Services.
2. Outside view: Current trend (722 cases with 4 new cases/week) suggests ~746 cases by July 1.
3. Consistency check: Implied median ~750; mean ~780 (higher due to right skew).
4. Key evidence: Strong deceleration pattern; fewer than 10 actively infectious cases; 95% correlation with unvaccinated status; stable geographic concentration; historical decline patterns.
5. Blind spot: Virus finding large new pocket of unvaccinated individuals in urban areas, causing significant resurgence (would push outcome up).

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

I'll evaluate key sources from most to least recent:

**FOX 4 Dallas-Fort Worth (May 20, 2025)**
- Very recent (1 day old)
- Reports 722 total Texas cases since January
- Only 4 new cases since previous update
- Fewer than 10 cases currently infectious
- 406 cases in Gaines County (56% of total)
- 95% of cases were unvaccinated
- 92 hospitalizations total
- Two deaths of unvaccinated children
- Factual, health department sourced statistics

**CDC Data (May 16, 2025)**
- Recent (5 days old)
- Authoritative federal agency
- 1,024 national cases across 31 jurisdictions
- 14 ongoing outbreaks (≥3 related cases)
- 13% of cases hospitalized nationally
- 3 total deaths nationally
- Two-dose MMR vaccine 97% effective
- 5% of cases are breakthrough infections

**CIDRAP (May 13, 2025)**
- Recent (8 days old)
- Respected academic research center
- 717 Texas cases spanning 32 counties
- 8 new cases since May 9
- First two cases in Dallas metro area
- 15 additional cases unconnected to main outbreak
- Measles virus RNA detected in Houston wastewater in early January

**Houston Chronicle (April 23, 2025)**
- Less recent (28 days old)
- Respected regional newspaper
- 624 cases as of April 8
- Expert opinion from Catherine Troisi (UTHealth): "50% chance" Texas exceeds 1,000 cases
- Expert opinion from Rémy Pasco (UT Austin): Steady weekly case counts make endpoint hard to predict
- Expert opinion from Rebecca Fischer (Texas A&M): Continued steady cases "not a good thing"

**Recent AskNews articles confirm:**
- 722 confirmed cases in Texas (multiple sources, May 20-21)
- Only 4 new cases since previous week (Dallas Morning News, May 20)
- Spread to 30+ states nationally (Independent, May 21)
- Less than 1% of cases currently infectious (Dallas Morning News, May 20)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Current case count (722) and recent trajectory (4 new cases/week) confirmed by multiple independent reliable sources
- Vaccination status correlation: 95% of cases in unvaccinated individuals, consistent with established measles epidemiology
- Geographic distribution: 56% of cases concentrated in Gaines County with documented spread to 32 counties
- Hospitalization rate (92/722 = 12.7%) aligns with CDC's national data (13%)
- Fewer than 10 cases currently infectious (multiple sources)

**Moderate evidence:**
- Declining weekly case additions: 8 new cases May 9-13, dropping to 4 new cases May 13-20
- Expert opinions from public health authorities suggesting cautious outlook but noting clear deceleration
- Infectious disease spread patterns from previous measles outbreaks (e.g., 2019 outbreak showing how localized outbreaks can spread)
- Historic vaccination rates in affected communities (e.g., Gaines County's 14% exemption rate)

**Weak evidence:**
- Potential underreporting (suggested but unquantified)
- Possible impact of federal funding cuts on vaccination efforts
- Seasonal effects as schools close for summer

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction targets July 1, 2025, which is 41 days from today (May 21, 2025).

If this timeframe were halved (to ~20 days):
- Based on current rate of 4 new cases/week, we'd expect only 11-12 additional cases
- Less time for unexpected clusters to develop
- Prediction would be more certain and lower: ~735-740 cases

If doubled (to ~80 days):
- Much greater uncertainty
- More time for either containment or new waves
- Back-to-school effects might become relevant
- Prediction would have wider confidence intervals and potentially higher median

The 41-day window gives enough time to see continued evolution while retaining some predictive power from current trends.

## (d) Justification

Starting from the confirmed 722 cases (May 20, 2025), I need to project 41 days forward.

**Factors supporting continued deceleration:**
1. Clear downward trend in weekly additions (8→4 cases/week)
2. Fewer than 10 actively infectious cases currently
3. Two counties recently removed from "active transmission" list
4. Concentrated nature of outbreak (56% in single county)
5. Effective vaccination campaigns likely continuing

**Factors suggesting potential higher growth:**
1. Geographic spread to 32 counties including Dallas metro area
2. Ongoing vulnerability in low-vaccination communities
3. Potential for undetected transmission chains
4. Memorial Day and summer travel increasing transmission opportunities

**Growth rate calculation:**
- Recent data shows approximately 4-8 new cases/week, trending downward
- 41 days ≈ 5.9 weeks
- Conservatively: 5.9 weeks × 8 cases/week = 47 new cases
- Optimistically: 5.9 weeks × 4 cases/week = 24 new cases
- Most likely: Decreasing trend averaging ~6 cases/week = ~35 new cases

**Potential complications:**
- New clusters in previously unaffected communities
- Retrospective addition of previously undetected cases
- Improved surveillance finding missed cases

# Probability calibration

Based on the evidence analysis, I calibrate my prediction as follows:

- **Baseline**: Current 722 cases + ~35 new cases = ~757 cases
- **Optimistic scenario**: Strong containment with only ~20-25 new cases = ~742-747 cases
- **Pessimistic scenario**: New clusters emerge with ~50-70 new cases = ~772-792 cases
- **Very pessimistic scenario**: Major urban spread with ~100+ new cases = ~822+ cases

I believe the most likely outcome is continuation of the deceleration trend with some additional cases discovered. However, I maintain a right-skewed distribution to account for the possibility of unexpected clusters or retrospective additions.

# Checklist:
1. Target: Number of measles cases reported by Texas Health & Human Services on July 1, 2025
2. Base rate: 722 cases with recent addition rate of 4-8 cases/week
3. Consistency: Median ~757; mean ~780 due to right-skewed distribution
4. Key evidence: Current count (722), deceleration trend (4 new cases/week), <10 actively infectious cases, spread to 32 counties
5. Blind spot: Undetected urban cluster suddenly emerging would push numbers significantly higher

=== Forecaster 3 ===
Analysis:

1. Target variable  
Number of confirmed measles cases Texas HHS will report on July 1 2025.

2. Outside‐view base rate  
Texas cumulative cases as of May 20 are ≈722. Similar US measles outbreaks in low-vax pockets (Ohio 2014: 383; NY 2019: 900) suggest eventual plateaus around 1×–2× initial surge. Primary reference class yields a rough plateau near 800–1000 cases over ~4–6 months.

3. Source analysis  
• Texas HHS via Fox 4, Dallas News, NBC, CIDRAP (Apr–May 2025): consistent, direct case counts (Jun–Jul updates: Tues/Fri). Quality: high for raw counts; opinions from named experts secondary.  
• CDC national reports (Apr–May 2025): reliable for context but not Texas-specific.  
• Asknews articles on concert exposures, funding cuts, other states: weakly informative for Texas trajectory, anecdotal.  

4. Evidence weighing  
Strong evidence  
– Direct Texas HHS counts: 646 (Apr 25), 709 (May 9), 722 (May 20).  
– Historical measles outbreak dynamics: strong predictive power on plateauing in low-vax communities.  
Moderate evidence  
– Weekly new cases slowing: from ~4.5/day (Apr 25–May 9) to ~1.2/day (May 9–20).  
– Expert warnings of underreporting (CDC scientist), but no signs of exponential resurgence.  
Weak evidence  
– Sporadic media anecdote of concert exposures; broad federal funding debates unlikely to shift Texas totals dramatically by July.

5. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 41 days (May 21 → Jul 1).  
• If horizon halved (20 days): expect ~20-30 new cases at current pace.  
• If doubled (82 days): expect ~60-120 new cases absent new clusters.  
Outside‐view trend deceleration implies additional ~50±30 cases.

6. Justification & sub-factor breakdown  
(a) Continuation of current trend (low growth): adds ~1–2 cases/day; total ≈780.  
(b) Status quo if nothing changed: plateau near current 722, plus residual few cases → ≈740.  
(c) “No outcome” combination (decline to zero new cases) at 1% probability → ≈722.  
(d) “Yes outcome” (continued slow tail) at 60% → 750–820.  
(e) Unexpected outcome (new urban cluster) at 20% → additional 100–300 cases ⇒ 830–1020.  
(f) Low outcome drivers: accelerated vaccination uptake, strict school exclusions.  
(g) High outcome drivers: imported superspreading event, untracked undercount, vaccine backlash spikes.  

Blind-spot  
A large superspreading event in a major city (e.g., Dallas–Fort Worth school system) could add several hundred cases quickly, pushing counts well above 1000.  

Probability calibration  
Combining base‐rate plateau near 780 with tails for lower/higher surprises, I assign a median ≈780 and heavy upper tail to 1500+.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase target: Texas measles cases by Jul 1 (cases, cumulative).  
2. Outside‐view base rate: 722 current; reference class plateau ~800–1000.  
3. Implied median ≈780; mean ≈840; aligned with trend and tails.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Direct DSHS counts (Strong)  
   • Decelerating growth trend (Moderate)  
   • Historical measles plateaus (Strong)  
   • Risk of new cluster (Moderate)  
5. Blind spot: large urban superspreading event (upward risk).

=== Forecaster 4 ===
Analysis:

1. Forecast target  
  The question asks: “How many measles cases will Texas report on July 1 2025?” Resolution uses Texas HHS data accessed on or after that date. Units: cases.

2. Source analysis  
  a. Texas HHS via Fox4 (May 20): reports 722 cumulative cases, ≤10 actively infectious. High quality, direct state data.  
  b. CDC measles report (May 16): U.S. total 1024 cases, 947 outbreak‐associated. Reliable, aggregate national context.  
  c. Cidrap (May 13): Texas total 717 cases, first Dallas‐area cases. University‐based, reputable.  
  d. Houston Chronicle (Apr 23): 624 cases as of Apr 8; average ~50/week in mid-Mar to early-Apr. Good local expertise.  
  e. Texas Tribune/TPR (May 9): 709 cases in West Texas; hospitalization data. Trusted public radio.  
  – Opinions from named experts (Troisi, Pasco, Fischer) emphasize risk of plateau vs. resurgence.  

3. Evidence weighting  
  Strong evidence:  
    • Deceleration in weekly case counts (50→10 new/week) across independent state reports (Houston Chronicle, Fox4, TPR).  
    • Direct state data on active infections (<10), constraining further spread.  
  Moderate evidence:  
    • Expert judgment on difficulty of declaring end vs. endemic plateau.  
    • Historical reference: 2019 U.S. outbreak peaked then tapered after ~3 months.  
  Weak evidence:  
    • Anecdotal underreporting concerns; mass‐exposure events outside Texas (Shakira concert) unlikely to drive Texas counts materially.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
  Forecast horizon: ~41 days from May 21 to July 1.  
  – If horizon halved (~20 days remaining): expect roughly half the anticipated additional cases (≈25–30), yielding ~750.  
  – If doubled (~82 days): could accumulate ≈2× baseline growth, yielding ~820.  

5. Reference‐class (outside) view  
  • Analogous to 2019 U.S. measles surge localized in under-vaccinated pockets: curve rose rapidly, then plateaued/tapered by month 4–5.  
  • Base‐rate final Texas share of U.S. outbreak: ~2/3 of national. If U.S. ends ~1200–1500, Texas ends ~800–1000.  

6. Inside‐view adjustments  
  • Current weekly new cases ≈8–12; active infectious cases ≤10 → limited transmission potential. (Strong evidence)  
  • Public‐health measures (quarantines, school exclusions, vaccination drives) intensifying; further deceleration likely. (Moderate)  
  • Risk of small secondary clusters, but large flare‐ups unlikely given existing immunity gaps are known and targeted. (Moderate)  

7. Combined justification  
  – Status quo trend (+8 cases/week) → +48 by July 1 → 722 + 48 ≈ 770 (baseline).  
  – Downside (rapid containment) → +30 total → ~750.  
  – Upside (modest cluster elsewhere) → +100 total → ~820.  
  – Extreme tail: slow burn adding ~200 → ~920; or better control trimming to ~730.  

Probability calibration  
  I aim for a distribution centered ~770 with moderate tails to account for uncertainty and underreporting.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase target: “Texas cumulative measles cases reported on July 1 2025, units = cases.”  
2. Base rate: S-curve taper ~800 from reference‐class 2019 shape.  
3. Implied median ~770; mean ≈780. Aligns with decelerating trend.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Weekly new cases down from ~50 to ~10 (Strong).  
   • Active infectious ≤10 limiting spread (Strong).  
   • Historical taper after ~4 months in similar outbreaks (Moderate).  
   • Intensified vaccination/quarantine measures (Moderate).  
5. Blind spot: Undetected pockets of under-vaccination might trigger late surge → would push forecast upward.

=== Forecaster 5 ===
Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
• Texas HHS weekly dashboards (cited in Fox 4, Dallas Morning News and CIDRAP, latest 20 May): primary data, public-sector, very reliable, factual.  
• CDC measles “Cases and Outbreaks” update 16 May: national line list that embeds Texas numbers; excellent quality; confirms broad deceleration.  
• Houston Chronicle 23 Apr; NBC-DFW 25 Apr; Stateline 2 May: reputable outlets quoting the HHS spreadsheet; still useful for trend shape, but numbers now three-four weeks old.  
• Independent, El País, Infobae items 19-21 May: secondary repetition of CDC/HHS counts plus colour; factual element = “Texas at 722 cases”, quality acceptable, limited incremental value.  
• Expert commentary (Troisi, Pasco, Fischer) carried in Chronicle: infectious-disease faculty at accredited schools; opinions moderately weighted.  
All other articles (e.g., Shakira-concert exposure, funding cuts) contain no Texas-specific count change before 1 July; treated as low-impact speculation.

2. Evidence analysis (strength in brackets)  
• HHS total = 722 on 20 May; weekly additions now five cases, <1 % infectious (strong).  
• Post-peak measles outbreaks in US since 2000 typically add 10–25 % more cases after the apparent peak (strong).  
• Cases fell 31 → 14 → 5 per week over past three updates, suggesting approx. 50 % weekly decay (moderate).  
• Possibility of a new seed in another undervaccinated pocket (e.g., Houston, Dallas) exists but would have at most two serial-intervals (20–24 days) before the 1 July snapshot, capping extra growth at tens, not hundreds, of cases (moderate).  
• Under-reporting and data back-fills can tack on a single-digit to low-double-digit reconciliation on 1 July (weak).

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution: 41 (almost six weeks, ~3 measles serial intervals).  
If the question closed in 20 days, my median would drop about 20 cases (to 745).  
If it closed in 80 days, I would raise the median roughly 60 cases (to 825) and fatten the right tail.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate: post-peak U.S. state outbreaks add a further 15 % (mid-point of 10–25 %) after the peak week. Applying 15 % to the 709 tally of 9 May gives 815.  
Inside view: steep decay (halving of weekly incidence) since 1 May implies only 5-10 more confirmed chain-related cases (+1 %).  Add 5–25 for back-fills and a small chance of a late micro-cluster.  Resulting mean ≈ 775, median ≈ 765, mildly right-skewed.  
Structural drivers that could upend the baseline (large, unrecognized pocket with sub-80 % MMR; major super-spreader event within Texas) judged <10 % in the six-week window.

Probability calibration
Implied mean ≈ 780; median 765; 80 % range 730–870; right tail tapers to ~1150 at the 99th percentile.

Checklist:
1. Target: Cumulative measles cases reported by Texas HHS on or after 1 Jul 2025 (count of cases).  
2. Outside view base rate: add 15 % to May 9 total ⇒ 815.  
3. Consistency: median 765, mean 780; matches rationale of slow residual growth.  
4. Key evidence: (a) Official 20 May count 722; (b) Weekly additions fell 31→14→5; (c) Historical post-peak growth 10–25 %; (d) Only <10 active infectious cases; (e) Six weeks left—max two generations.  
5. Blind-spot: Silent seeding in an urban undervaccinated community erupting to 200+ cases by late June (would push outcome >900).

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth (May 20, 2025)**: Very recent, reliable reporting with specific figures - 722 total cases statewide since January, with just 4 new cases in the latest update. Details county-level breakdown, with Gaines County remaining at 406 cases (56% of total). States 95% of cases (688) were unvaccinated individuals. Attributes data to Texas Health and Human Services.

**CDC Report (May 16, 2025)**: Authoritative health agency reporting 1,024 national cases across 31 jurisdictions. Shows 13% hospitalization rate, with higher rates among children under 5. Provides valuable national context but lacks Texas-specific breakdown.

**CIDRAP (May 13, 2025)**: Highly credible infectious disease research center reporting 717 Texas cases spanning 32 counties, plus 15 cases not connected to the West Texas outbreak. Notes two counties were removed from "active transmission" list after no new cases for two incubation periods.

**Houston Chronicle (April 23, 2025)**: Older but contains valuable expert opinions from epidemiologists at UTHealth, UT Austin, and Texas A&M. Dr. Catherine Troisi estimated "at least a 50% chance" of reaching 1,000+ cases by early summer. Reports ~50 new cases weekly since mid-February, with surge in March.

**Recent Asknews Articles**: Multiple May 20-21 sources (Dallas Morning News, Independent) confirm 722 cases with minimal recent growth. May 9 Telemundo report showed 709 cases with 7 new cases that week, demonstrating consistent deceleration.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **Case count deceleration pattern** (multiple independent sources): From ~50 weekly cases in February-March to just 4 in past week.
- **Geographic concentration remains stable**: 56% of cases in Gaines County (406/722), indicating limited geographic expansion.
- **Vaccination status correlation**: 95% of cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals, creating natural firewall for spread.
- **Actively infectious cases declining**: "Fewer than 10" cases currently infectious per Texas HHS, limiting transmission potential.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Counties removed from outbreak list**: Garza, Lynn, and Dallam counties show successful containment in some areas.
- **Historical outbreak patterns**: Previous Texas outbreaks (1990-1992) show eventual containment after peaks.
- **Hospitalization data**: 92 hospitalizations in outbreak (per FOX 4), suggesting steady rather than dramatically increasing severity.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Expert opinions from April**: Predictions from experts were made when the outbreak was still accelerating.
- **Potential for underreporting**: Suggestion that some cases may not be captured in official counts.
- **International context**: Global measles resurgence continues (Vietnam, Romania noted in Taiwan news article).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is 41 days (May 21, 2025 to July 1, 2025).

If the timeframe were halved (20-21 days), we would expect fewer additional cases (~10-15) since the outbreak is decelerating. The prediction would likely be around 735-740 cases.

If the timeframe were doubled (82 days), uncertainty would increase substantially. While current trajectory suggests continued deceleration, a longer window provides more opportunity for either (a) the outbreak to be nearly contained with only occasional new cases, or (b) the virus to find new pockets of susceptible individuals, resulting in new clusters. The prediction range would widen, with the upper bound potentially reaching 900-1,000 cases.

## (d) Justification

Starting with our current count of 722 cases (May 20, 2025), I need to project forward 41 days.

**Factors supporting continued deceleration:**
1. The outbreak has shown consistent deceleration, from ~50 cases weekly in February-March to just 4 new cases in the past week.
2. Fewer than 10 active infectious cases currently exist.
3. The geographic concentration remains stable (56% in Gaines County).
4. The removal of three counties from the "active transmission" list demonstrates successful containment efforts.
5. The 95% correlation with unvaccinated status suggests limited potential to spread in vaccinated populations.

**Factors suggesting potential for continued spread:**
1. Measles is highly contagious (90% infection rate among susceptible contacts).
2. The virus has already spread to 32 counties across Texas.
3. The national measles resurgence continues (1,024+ cases in 31 states).
4. Multiple states reported funding cuts affecting vaccination campaigns (Stateline article).
5. The HHS Secretary's statement that "the spread of the virus may continue for a year" (per Telemundo).

**Synthesis:**
The evidence strongly indicates an outbreak that has peaked and is now in steady decline. At the current rate of ~4 new cases weekly, we would expect approximately 23-24 more cases by July 1, for a total of ~745-746.

However, the right tail risk remains significant due to measles' contagiousness and the possibility of finding new susceptible populations. The baseline expectation should be continued deceleration, but with allowance for potential occasional clusters that could increase the total more substantially.

## Probability Calibration

Starting with our current count of 722, I'll project forward 41 days based on the observed deceleration pattern:

At the current rate of ~4 new cases weekly, we would expect ~24 more cases by July 1, for a total of 746. This forms my median estimate.

The distribution should reflect:
- Lower percentiles: Scenarios where deceleration continues and strengthens (few new cases)
- Middle percentiles: Scenarios with continued slow spread at current reduced rates
- Upper percentiles: Scenarios where new clusters emerge in previously unaffected areas
- Extreme upper percentiles: Scenarios with significant resurgence finding new susceptible populations

The distribution is right-skewed due to the asymmetric risk - there's more potential for unexpected upside surprises than downside (cases can't go below 722).

## Checklist:
1. Target variable: Number of measles cases Texas will report on July 1, 2025, per Texas Health & Human Services.
2. Outside view: Current trend (722 cases with 4 new cases/week) suggests ~746 cases by July 1.
3. Consistency check: Implied median ~750; mean ~780 (higher due to right skew).
4. Key evidence: Strong deceleration pattern; fewer than 10 actively infectious cases; 95% correlation with unvaccinated status; stable geographic concentration; historical decline patterns.
5. Blind spot: Virus finding large new pocket of unvaccinated individuals in urban areas, causing significant resurgence (would push outcome up).

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

I'll evaluate key sources from most to least recent:

**FOX 4 Dallas-Fort Worth (May 20, 2025)**
- Very recent (1 day old)
- Reports 722 total Texas cases since January
- Only 4 new cases since previous update
- Fewer than 10 cases currently infectious
- 406 cases in Gaines County (56% of total)
- 95% of cases were unvaccinated
- 92 hospitalizations total
- Two deaths of unvaccinated children
- Factual, health department sourced statistics

**CDC Data (May 16, 2025)**
- Recent (5 days old)
- Authoritative federal agency
- 1,024 national cases across 31 jurisdictions
- 14 ongoing outbreaks (≥3 related cases)
- 13% of cases hospitalized nationally
- 3 total deaths nationally
- Two-dose MMR vaccine 97% effective
- 5% of cases are breakthrough infections

**CIDRAP (May 13, 2025)**
- Recent (8 days old)
- Respected academic research center
- 717 Texas cases spanning 32 counties
- 8 new cases since May 9
- First two cases in Dallas metro area
- 15 additional cases unconnected to main outbreak
- Measles virus RNA detected in Houston wastewater in early January

**Houston Chronicle (April 23, 2025)**
- Less recent (28 days old)
- Respected regional newspaper
- 624 cases as of April 8
- Expert opinion from Catherine Troisi (UTHealth): "50% chance" Texas exceeds 1,000 cases
- Expert opinion from Rémy Pasco (UT Austin): Steady weekly case counts make endpoint hard to predict
- Expert opinion from Rebecca Fischer (Texas A&M): Continued steady cases "not a good thing"

**Recent AskNews articles confirm:**
- 722 confirmed cases in Texas (multiple sources, May 20-21)
- Only 4 new cases since previous week (Dallas Morning News, May 20)
- Spread to 30+ states nationally (Independent, May 21)
- Less than 1% of cases currently infectious (Dallas Morning News, May 20)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Current case count (722) and recent trajectory (4 new cases/week) confirmed by multiple independent reliable sources
- Vaccination status correlation: 95% of cases in unvaccinated individuals, consistent with established measles epidemiology
- Geographic distribution: 56% of cases concentrated in Gaines County with documented spread to 32 counties
- Hospitalization rate (92/722 = 12.7%) aligns with CDC's national data (13%)
- Fewer than 10 cases currently infectious (multiple sources)

**Moderate evidence:**
- Declining weekly case additions: 8 new cases May 9-13, dropping to 4 new cases May 13-20
- Expert opinions from public health authorities suggesting cautious outlook but noting clear deceleration
- Infectious disease spread patterns from previous measles outbreaks (e.g., 2019 outbreak showing how localized outbreaks can spread)
- Historic vaccination rates in affected communities (e.g., Gaines County's 14% exemption rate)

**Weak evidence:**
- Potential underreporting (suggested but unquantified)
- Possible impact of federal funding cuts on vaccination efforts
- Seasonal effects as schools close for summer

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction targets July 1, 2025, which is 41 days from today (May 21, 2025).

If this timeframe were halved (to ~20 days):
- Based on current rate of 4 new cases/week, we'd expect only 11-12 additional cases
- Less time for unexpected clusters to develop
- Prediction would be more certain and lower: ~735-740 cases

If doubled (to ~80 days):
- Much greater uncertainty
- More time for either containment or new waves
- Back-to-school effects might become relevant
- Prediction would have wider confidence intervals and potentially higher median

The 41-day window gives enough time to see continued evolution while retaining some predictive power from current trends.

## (d) Justification

Starting from the confirmed 722 cases (May 20, 2025), I need to project 41 days forward.

**Factors supporting continued deceleration:**
1. Clear downward trend in weekly additions (8→4 cases/week)
2. Fewer than 10 actively infectious cases currently
3. Two counties recently removed from "active transmission" list
4. Concentrated nature of outbreak (56% in single county)
5. Effective vaccination campaigns likely continuing

**Factors suggesting potential higher growth:**
1. Geographic spread to 32 counties including Dallas metro area
2. Ongoing vulnerability in low-vaccination communities
3. Potential for undetected transmission chains
4. Memorial Day and summer travel increasing transmission opportunities

**Growth rate calculation:**
- Recent data shows approximately 4-8 new cases/week, trending downward
- 41 days ≈ 5.9 weeks
- Conservatively: 5.9 weeks × 8 cases/week = 47 new cases
- Optimistically: 5.9 weeks × 4 cases/week = 24 new cases
- Most likely: Decreasing trend averaging ~6 cases/week = ~35 new cases

**Potential complications:**
- New clusters in previously unaffected communities
- Retrospective addition of previously undetected cases
- Improved surveillance finding missed cases

# Probability calibration

Based on the evidence analysis, I calibrate my prediction as follows:

- **Baseline**: Current 722 cases + ~35 new cases = ~757 cases
- **Optimistic scenario**: Strong containment with only ~20-25 new cases = ~742-747 cases
- **Pessimistic scenario**: New clusters emerge with ~50-70 new cases = ~772-792 cases
- **Very pessimistic scenario**: Major urban spread with ~100+ new cases = ~822+ cases

I believe the most likely outcome is continuation of the deceleration trend with some additional cases discovered. However, I maintain a right-skewed distribution to account for the possibility of unexpected clusters or retrospective additions.

# Checklist:
1. Target: Number of measles cases reported by Texas Health & Human Services on July 1, 2025
2. Base rate: 722 cases with recent addition rate of 4-8 cases/week
3. Consistency: Median ~757; mean ~780 due to right-skewed distribution
4. Key evidence: Current count (722), deceleration trend (4 new cases/week), <10 actively infectious cases, spread to 32 counties
5. Blind spot: Undetected urban cluster suddenly emerging would push numbers significantly higher

=== Forecaster 3 ===
Analysis:

1. Target variable  
Number of confirmed measles cases Texas HHS will report on July 1 2025.

2. Outside‐view base rate  
Texas cumulative cases as of May 20 are ≈722. Similar US measles outbreaks in low-vax pockets (Ohio 2014: 383; NY 2019: 900) suggest eventual plateaus around 1×–2× initial surge. Primary reference class yields a rough plateau near 800–1000 cases over ~4–6 months.

3. Source analysis  
• Texas HHS via Fox 4, Dallas News, NBC, CIDRAP (Apr–May 2025): consistent, direct case counts (Jun–Jul updates: Tues/Fri). Quality: high for raw counts; opinions from named experts secondary.  
• CDC national reports (Apr–May 2025): reliable for context but not Texas-specific.  
• Asknews articles on concert exposures, funding cuts, other states: weakly informative for Texas trajectory, anecdotal.  

4. Evidence weighing  
Strong evidence  
– Direct Texas HHS counts: 646 (Apr 25), 709 (May 9), 722 (May 20).  
– Historical measles outbreak dynamics: strong predictive power on plateauing in low-vax communities.  
Moderate evidence  
– Weekly new cases slowing: from ~4.5/day (Apr 25–May 9) to ~1.2/day (May 9–20).  
– Expert warnings of underreporting (CDC scientist), but no signs of exponential resurgence.  
Weak evidence  
– Sporadic media anecdote of concert exposures; broad federal funding debates unlikely to shift Texas totals dramatically by July.

5. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 41 days (May 21 → Jul 1).  
• If horizon halved (20 days): expect ~20-30 new cases at current pace.  
• If doubled (82 days): expect ~60-120 new cases absent new clusters.  
Outside‐view trend deceleration implies additional ~50±30 cases.

6. Justification & sub-factor breakdown  
(a) Continuation of current trend (low growth): adds ~1–2 cases/day; total ≈780.  
(b) Status quo if nothing changed: plateau near current 722, plus residual few cases → ≈740.  
(c) “No outcome” combination (decline to zero new cases) at 1% probability → ≈722.  
(d) “Yes outcome” (continued slow tail) at 60% → 750–820.  
(e) Unexpected outcome (new urban cluster) at 20% → additional 100–300 cases ⇒ 830–1020.  
(f) Low outcome drivers: accelerated vaccination uptake, strict school exclusions.  
(g) High outcome drivers: imported superspreading event, untracked undercount, vaccine backlash spikes.  

Blind-spot  
A large superspreading event in a major city (e.g., Dallas–Fort Worth school system) could add several hundred cases quickly, pushing counts well above 1000.  

Probability calibration  
Combining base‐rate plateau near 780 with tails for lower/higher surprises, I assign a median ≈780 and heavy upper tail to 1500+.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase target: Texas measles cases by Jul 1 (cases, cumulative).  
2. Outside‐view base rate: 722 current; reference class plateau ~800–1000.  
3. Implied median ≈780; mean ≈840; aligned with trend and tails.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Direct DSHS counts (Strong)  
   • Decelerating growth trend (Moderate)  
   • Historical measles plateaus (Strong)  
   • Risk of new cluster (Moderate)  
5. Blind spot: large urban superspreading event (upward risk).

Analysis:

1. Forecast target  
  The question asks: “How many measles cases will Texas report on July 1 2025?” Resolution uses Texas HHS data accessed on or after that date. Units: cases.

2. Source analysis  
  a. Texas HHS via Fox4 (May 20): reports 722 cumulative cases, ≤10 actively infectious. High quality, direct state data.  
  b. CDC measles report (May 16): U.S. total 1024 cases, 947 outbreak‐associated. Reliable, aggregate national context.  
  c. Cidrap (May 13): Texas total 717 cases, first Dallas‐area cases. University‐based, reputable.  
  d. Houston Chronicle (Apr 23): 624 cases as of Apr 8; average ~50/week in mid-Mar to early-Apr. Good local expertise.  
  e. Texas Tribune/TPR (May 9): 709 cases in West Texas; hospitalization data. Trusted public radio.  
  – Opinions from named experts (Troisi, Pasco, Fischer) emphasize risk of plateau vs. resurgence.  

3. Evidence weighting  
  Strong evidence:  
    • Deceleration in weekly case counts (50→10 new/week) across independent state reports (Houston Chronicle, Fox4, TPR).  
    • Direct state data on active infections (<10), constraining further spread.  
  Moderate evidence:  
    • Expert judgment on difficulty of declaring end vs. endemic plateau.  
    • Historical reference: 2019 U.S. outbreak peaked then tapered after ~3 months.  
  Weak evidence:  
    • Anecdotal underreporting concerns; mass‐exposure events outside Texas (Shakira concert) unlikely to drive Texas counts materially.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
  Forecast horizon: ~41 days from May 21 to July 1.  
  – If horizon halved (~20 days remaining): expect roughly half the anticipated additional cases (≈25–30), yielding ~750.  
  – If doubled (~82 days): could accumulate ≈2× baseline growth, yielding ~820.  

5. Reference‐class (outside) view  
  • Analogous to 2019 U.S. measles surge localized in under-vaccinated pockets: curve rose rapidly, then plateaued/tapered by month 4–5.  
  • Base‐rate final Texas share of U.S. outbreak: ~2/3 of national. If U.S. ends ~1200–1500, Texas ends ~800–1000.  

6. Inside‐view adjustments  
  • Current weekly new cases ≈8–12; active infectious cases ≤10 → limited transmission potential. (Strong evidence)  
  • Public‐health measures (quarantines, school exclusions, vaccination drives) intensifying; further deceleration likely. (Moderate)  
  • Risk of small secondary clusters, but large flare‐ups unlikely given existing immunity gaps are known and targeted. (Moderate)  

7. Combined justification  
  – Status quo trend (+8 cases/week) → +48 by July 1 → 722 + 48 ≈ 770 (baseline).  
  – Downside (rapid containment) → +30 total → ~750.  
  – Upside (modest cluster elsewhere) → +100 total → ~820.  
  – Extreme tail: slow burn adding ~200 → ~920; or better control trimming to ~730.  

Probability calibration  
  I aim for a distribution centered ~770 with moderate tails to account for uncertainty and underreporting.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase target: “Texas cumulative measles cases reported on July 1 2025, units = cases.”  
2. Base rate: S-curve taper ~800 from reference‐class 2019 shape.  
3. Implied median ~770; mean ≈780. Aligns with decelerating trend.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Weekly new cases down from ~50 to ~10 (Strong).  
   • Active infectious ≤10 limiting spread (Strong).  
   • Historical taper after ~4 months in similar outbreaks (Moderate).  
   • Intensified vaccination/quarantine measures (Moderate).  
5. Blind spot: Undetected pockets of under-vaccination might trigger late surge → would push forecast upward.

Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
• Texas HHS weekly dashboards (cited in Fox 4, Dallas Morning News and CIDRAP, latest 20 May): primary data, public-sector, very reliable, factual.  
• CDC measles “Cases and Outbreaks” update 16 May: national line list that embeds Texas numbers; excellent quality; confirms broad deceleration.  
• Houston Chronicle 23 Apr; NBC-DFW 25 Apr; Stateline 2 May: reputable outlets quoting the HHS spreadsheet; still useful for trend shape, but numbers now three-four weeks old.  
• Independent, El País, Infobae items 19-21 May: secondary repetition of CDC/HHS counts plus colour; factual element = “Texas at 722 cases”, quality acceptable, limited incremental value.  
• Expert commentary (Troisi, Pasco, Fischer) carried in Chronicle: infectious-disease faculty at accredited schools; opinions moderately weighted.  
All other articles (e.g., Shakira-concert exposure, funding cuts) contain no Texas-specific count change before 1 July; treated as low-impact speculation.

2. Evidence analysis (strength in brackets)  
• HHS total = 722 on 20 May; weekly additions now five cases, <1 % infectious (strong).  
• Post-peak measles outbreaks in US since 2000 typically add 10–25 % more cases after the apparent peak (strong).  
• Cases fell 31 → 14 → 5 per week over past three updates, suggesting approx. 50 % weekly decay (moderate).  
• Possibility of a new seed in another undervaccinated pocket (e.g., Houston, Dallas) exists but would have at most two serial-intervals (20–24 days) before the 1 July snapshot, capping extra growth at tens, not hundreds, of cases (moderate).  
• Under-reporting and data back-fills can tack on a single-digit to low-double-digit reconciliation on 1 July (weak).

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution: 41 (almost six weeks, ~3 measles serial intervals).  
If the question closed in 20 days, my median would drop about 20 cases (to 745).  
If it closed in 80 days, I would raise the median roughly 60 cases (to 825) and fatten the right tail.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate: post-peak U.S. state outbreaks add a further 15 % (mid-point of 10–25 %) after the peak week. Applying 15 % to the 709 tally of 9 May gives 815.  
Inside view: steep decay (halving of weekly incidence) since 1 May implies only 5-10 more confirmed chain-related cases (+1 %).  Add 5–25 for back-fills and a small chance of a late micro-cluster.  Resulting mean ≈ 775, median ≈ 765, mildly right-skewed.  
Structural drivers that could upend the baseline (large, unrecognized pocket with sub-80 % MMR; major super-spreader event within Texas) judged <10 % in the six-week window.

Probability calibration
Implied mean ≈ 780; median 765; 80 % range 730–870; right tail tapers to ~1150 at the 99th percentile.

Checklist:
1. Target: Cumulative measles cases reported by Texas HHS on or after 1 Jul 2025 (count of cases).  
2. Outside view base rate: add 15 % to May 9 total ⇒ 815.  
3. Consistency: median 765, mean 780; matches rationale of slow residual growth.  
4. Key evidence: (a) Official 20 May count 722; (b) Weekly additions fell 31→14→5; (c) Historical post-peak growth 10–25 %; (d) Only <10 active infectious cases; (e) Six weeks left—max two generations.  
5. Blind-spot: Silent seeding in an urban undervaccinated community erupting to 200+ cases by late June (would push outcome >900).
