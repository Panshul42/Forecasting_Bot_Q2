Analysis:
The key to building an out-view baseline is understanding Republika Srpska’s prior moves toward an independence referendum and how quickly those plans moved from announcement to scheduling (or were halted). In 2016–17, RS leaders publicly discussed a referendum and even set tentative dates, only to back down under constitutional and international pressure. We need to know:
- Which RS body or leader has statutory authority to call a referendum and how they announced it in the past.
- Exact dates of past announcements and cancellations, plus Constitutional Court rulings.
- The political context (party positions, election cycles) surrounding those attempts.
Gathering this will help estimate lead times and political triggers, providing a baseline against which to measure any new signals before July 2025.

Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether Republika Srpska (RS) will officially announce an independence-referendum date by July 1, 2025, is to track RS–government actions and public statements over the next two months. We need the most recent reports on:
• Legislative steps in the RS National Assembly (e.g., referral laws, establishment of a referendum commission)  
• Public statements by President Milorad Dodik, the RS prime minister, or heads of key parliamentary committees  
• Announcements or leaks from the RS Central Election Commission about referendum scheduling  
• Reactions from Bosnia–Herzegovina’s central authorities or international actors that might prompt RS to act  
• Any court rulings or legal opinions within RS concerning the referendum’s legality  

To gather these, we require targeted queries for general web search (Google), current reporting (Google News), and a broader briefing request (Assistant).

Key facts and figures  
• Since 2015 Republika Srpska (RS) has marked its entity-day on 9 January with a parade banned by Bosnia’s Constitutional Court.  
• RS is one of two entities created by the 14 November 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement (the other is the Federation, plus the Brčko District).  
• Bosnia’s 1992–95 war left an estimated 100,000 dead. Serb forces committed widespread ethnic cleansing (particularly against Bosniaks), ran concentration camps, and in July 1995 killed more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica.  
• Bosniaks constitute over 50 percent of Bosnia’s overall population but only about 14 percent of RS’s population.

Background on Milorad Dodik  
• President of RS since the mid-2010s; began as a moderate in the early 2000s but, especially since returning as prime minister in 2006, has adopted an ultra-nationalist, Islamophobic stance akin to wartime leader Radovan Karadžić.  
• Routinely blocks Bosnia’s state institutions and international oversight, aiming to keep the country dysfunctional and create a pathway to RS secession.  
• Hosted a Trump-celebration event in Banja Luka after the 2020 US election, donning a “Make America Great Again” cap and projecting Trump’s image onto the presidential palace façade—he hopes for US backing for RS independence.

Named opinions and statements  
• US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (early 2000s): described Dodik as “a breath of fresh air” and “the darling of the international community.”  
• Serbia’s Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin and Dodik himself have publicly declared that the chief “national issue” for Serbs today is uniting all “Serbian territories” into a single state.  

Geopolitical alliances and projects  
• Dodik’s principal external supporters:  
 – Hungary under Viktor Orbán, which within the EU has blocked measures aimed at containing RS’s separatism.  
 – Russia, which pursues “opportunistic destabilization” in the Balkans; its preferred local partners are RS and Serbia under Aleksandar Vučić.  
• Dodik promotes the concept of “Srpski svet” (“Serbian world”), modeled on Putin’s “Russkiy mir,” to bind Serb-populated areas (Serbia, RS, Kosovo, Montenegro) into a shared political-cultural space. Some proponents downplay its political aims, but key figures openly frame it as an irredentist project.

Less-reliable or local viewpoints  
• Hard-line RS nationalists and organizers of the forbidden 9 January parade see Dodik’s moves (anniversary celebrations, alliance-building) as steps toward a de facto referendum and eventual secession—though no official date has yet been set (per this article).

<Summary source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_secession_of_Republika_Srpska">
Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the April 2, 2019 Wikipedia article “Proposed secession of Republika Srpska.”  

1. Context and Background  
• 1995 Dayton Agreement created Bosnia and Herzegovina as two entities:  
  – Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosniak/Croat–inhabited)  
  – Republika Srpska (Serb-inhabited)  
• Post-war Bosnian Serbs initially “anti-Dayton” but, since 2000, generally supportive of RS’s continued autonomy.  
• Bosniaks regard RS as illegitimate; various RS leaders have floated an independence referendum over the years.  
• Regional precedents—Montenegro’s 2006 referendum and Kosovo’s 2008 independence—have encouraged renewed calls in RS for a vote and possible unification with Serbia.

2. Key Proposals and Political Moves  
• 12 September 1996: RS President Biljana Plavšić called for secession and union with FR Yugoslavia; retracted under OSCE pressure.  
• 15 June 2006: Banja Luka demonstration endorsing an RS independence referendum if Kosovo became independent.  
• 21 February 2008: RS National Assembly passed a resolution to hold an independence referendum should a majority of UN (especially EU) members recognize Kosovo’s independence; the U.S. cut aid to Dodik’s SNSD party and the EU condemned the move.  
• April 2015: SNSD (Alliance of Independent Social Democrats) assembly resolution to call a 2018 referendum on breaking away from BiH if RS autonomy were not enhanced.  
• February 2016: The proposed “court and prosecution” referendum was indefinitely postponed by RS authorities.

3. Public Opinion and Expert Assessments  
• November 2010 Gallup Balkan Monitor poll: 88% of Bosnian Serbs would support an RS independence referendum. (Gallup Brussels–based study)  
• 2012–2014: Former CIA Balkans chief Steven Meyer expressed belief that RS would eventually become independent. (Named source)  
• Early 2016:  
  – BMI Research: RS unlikely to achieve formal independence in the next five years due to EU/US opposition, though a unilateral declaration could risk isolation. (Named source)  
  – “Mic” analysts (less prominent outlet) suggested RS might be independent by 2025.  
  – RS court referendum postponed; U.S. analyst Daniel Serwer argued RS would never actually break away. (Named source)  

4. International and Legal Constraints  
• Peace Implementation Council: Entities in BiH have no right to secede.  
• High Representative Miroslav Lajčák (2007): RS has “absolutely no right” to secede; would invoke Bonn Powers if peace threatened.  
• High Representative Valentin Inzko (December 2016): A separatist referendum in RS would prompt international intervention; an independent RS would lack recognition.  

5. Other Notable Statements  
• Milorad Dodik (various dates): He would only pursue a referendum if RS autonomy were imperiled or if Kosovo’s independence were widely recognized; in May 2015 warned RS was “in danger of disappearing” if BiH institutions were reformed unfavorably.  
• Serbian President Boris Tadić (2008): Serbia, as a Dayton guarantor, supported BiH’s territorial integrity and did not back RS secession.  

This article thus chronicles over two decades of episodic secessionist initiatives in Republika Srpska—ranging from leadership declarations and assembly resolutions to public‐opinion polls and expert prognoses—set against strong international and legal opposition to any formal referendum on independence.

Disclaimer: Content is based solely on the February 20, 2021 Biztonságpolitika article by Kőbányai Dénes.  

Key facts and events  
• 1996: RS leaders briefly pursued formal accession to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; shelved under intense international pressure.  
• February 2008: RS assembly passed a resolution pledging a referendum on independence if a “majority of the international community” (including the EU) recognized Kosovo’s independence. The United States and European Union strongly opposed this plan, and no referendum was held.  
• 2011: A fresh referendum initiative likewise failed amid international criticism.  
• October 2012: Milorad Dodik (by then RS president and SNSD leader) publicly declared RS would become independent and could survive as a sovereign state.  
• 2015–2017: Dodik and his party made independence a formal party program, warning that if RS autonomy was not extended by end-2017, a secession referendum would follow in 2018. In September 2017, Dodik postponed plans for a 2018 vote, though he left open future referenda.  
• February 7, 2020: The Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitutional Court struck down Article 53 of the RS Law on Agricultural Land (which had claimed former Yugoslav state lands for RS), ruling such land must be state property.  
• Since the 2020 ruling:  
  – RS Serb deputies have suspended participation in state-level decision-making bodies.  
  – RS leaders are pushing an unconstitutional reform of the national Constitutional Court, accusing it—and its three foreign judges—of bias.  
  – Two Serb judges risk being barred from the Court.  
  – The vice-president of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) warned Court decisions are “destroying the identity of Serbs.”  
• February 15, 2020: Dodik and other Bosnian Serb leaders met Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić in Belgrade. Vučić urged that RS measures “must not destabilize the region” and be carried out within legal and institutional frameworks.  
• Dodik remains publicly determined to hold an independence referendum, though significant international and internal legal pushback continues.  

Notable opinions  
• Miroslav Lajčák, former High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina: RS has no right to secede, as its territorial integrity is guaranteed by the Dayton Peace Agreement. (2008)  
• U.S. and EU officials: consistently opposed RS referendum plans as violations of the Dayton framework.  

Less-reliable or partisan claims (noted as such in the article)  
• RS leadership’s accusation that state courts and prosecutors are biased against Serbs.  
• Claims that Ottoman-era land transfers justify current RS ownership of former Yugoslav state lands.

<Summary source="https://www.newsweek.com/serbian-referendum-bosnia-war-fighting-tensions-501477">
Here’s a concise summary of the Reuters article “Planned Serb Vote Awakens Fears Of Strife In Bosnia” (Newsweek, Sept. 22, 2016):

1. Referendum plan  
  • Bosnia’s autonomous Serb entity (the Republika Srpska) scheduled a Jan. 9 referendum on marking “Statehood Day,” defying a Sarajevo-based Constitutional Court decision banning it.  
  • This would be the first Bosnian referendum since a 1992 secession plebiscite that preceded the 1992–95 war, in which about 100,000 people were killed.

2. Court ruling and political aims  
  • The Constitutional Court ruled Jan. 9 illegal because it overlaps with a Serbian Orthodox holiday, discriminating against Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic Croats.  
  • Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik appears to be using the vote to spotlight Sarajevo’s weak central authority and lay groundwork for a future secession referendum.  
  • More than 90 prior Constitutional Court rulings have been ignored by Bosnia’s autonomous entities.

3. International reactions  
  • United States: The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo warned that defying the court threatens the rule of law, stability, security and prosperity, and insisted the Dayton Peace Agreement “cannot be challenged without consequences.”  
  • European Union: The EU opposes the Serb referendum, views a strong, multiethnic Bosnia as essential for regional peace and a prerequisite for Bosnia’s eventual EU membership. (EU foreign ministers this week accepted Bosnia’s application for EU membership.)  
  • Serbia: Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić warned of renewed instability.  
  • Russia: President Vladimir Putin endorsed the referendum and invited Dodik to Moscow; Russia abstained from a joint statement by Bosnia’s international peace overseers urging cancellation.

4. Local sentiment  
  • Zeljko Kovac, an unemployed war veteran in Banja Luka, told Reuters he would vote “because I fought for the Serb Republic,” adding “We will not take orders from Muslims on what we are going to celebrate.”

<Summary source="https://www.rferl.org/a/politics-of-fear-referendum-in-republika-srpska-statehood-day-dodik/28009309.html">
Below is a concise summary of the RFE/RL article “The Politics Of Fear: Referendum In Republika Srpska,” published September 23, 2016. 

1. Referendum on January 9 Statehood Day  
   • Milorad Dodik, president of Republika Srpska (RS), called a referendum for September 25, 2016, asking whether January 9 should be celebrated as RS’s Statehood Day.  
   • The Bosnian Constitutional Court had ruled January 9 unconstitutional because it excludes non-Serbs; Dodik ignored the ruling and pressed ahead.  
   • Many observers view this vote as a “dress rehearsal” for secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina.

2. Propaganda and public messaging  
   • RFE/RL aired a video clip featuring “Stefan,” who frames January 9 as central to his identity, portraying Serb victimhood while omitting the larger wartime suffering of Bosnian Muslims and Serb-led war crimes.  
   • The article notes this is an emotionally charged narrative that distorts the 1992–95 war’s realities.

3. Reaction from Bosniak wartime general Sefer Halilović  
   • Halilović, former commander of the Bosnian Army, told Sarajevo’s TV 1 that RS’s defiance of Dayton accords and its Constitutional Court is “dangerous” and could threaten RS’s very existence.  
   • He warned Bosnia would resist any attempt to “break off a piece” peacefully.  
   • Halilović leads a fringe party with minimal parliamentary representation; even the Serbian daily Blic called him a “marginal character.”

4. Responses in Serbia  
   • Serbian Foreign Minister publicly criticized Halilović’s comments; Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić considered cutting short his U.S. visit over the dispute.  
   • In an interview with B92, Vučić said he’d been privately urged by unnamed world leaders not to react to Halilović, whom he called “a madman,” but he remained concerned about broader support for those views.  
   • Vučić affirmed Serbia “respects Bosnia-Herzegovina’s integrity” but would “not allow Republika Srpska to be destroyed.”

5. Emir Kusturica’s commentary  
   • Film director Emir Kusturica blamed Bosniak leader Bakir Izetbegović for threatening peace, likening the situation to the rejected 1992 “Cutileiro plan” (a proposed ethnic division of Bosnia).  
   • RFE/RL notes Kusturica omitted that Bosnian Serb leaders and the Yugoslav Army initiated the 1992 war and that Izetbegović was briefly detained by Serb forces at Sarajevo airport.

6. Article’s assessment  
   • The piece argues that Dodik’s real‐world referendum is a serious threat to Bosnia’s cohesion, widening divisions between Serbs and non-Serbs.  
   • It suggests politicians on all sides are stoking fear ahead of RS local elections on October 2, 2016.

<Summary source="https://www.rferl.org/a/balkan-tensions-rise-as-bosnian-serbs-push-ahead-with-banned-referendum/28010813.html">
The September 25, 2016 referendum in Republika Srpska (RS) asked voters whether to retain January 9 as “statehood day,” a Serbian Orthodox holiday marking the 1992 Bosnian Serb declaration of independence. RS authorities defied a September 17 ruling by Bosnia’s Constitutional Court—which had deemed the holiday discriminatory against Bosniaks and Croats—and went ahead with the vote.

• Turnout was reported at 56–60 percent. With 30.76 percent of ballots counted, authorities said 99.8 percent voted in favor.  
• Dragan Lukac, RS interior minister and head of its election commission, told journalists in Banja Luka that voting “went smoothly” and no incidents occurred, though more than a dozen polling stations in Bosniak-majority areas did not open.  
• Milorad Dodik, RS president, framed the referendum as defending entity rights but insisted “secession is not on our short-term agenda,” even as critics warn it fuels separatism.  

Reactions:  
• Bakir Izetbegović (Bosnia’s Muslim presidency member) warned defiance of the court could lead to an uncontrolled “adventure.”  
• EU High Representative Valentin Inzko called it “a direct attack against a constitutional court,” and the U.S. Embassy threatened unspecified “consequences” if it wasn’t canceled.  
• The Peace Implementation Council urged cancellation, asserting Bosnia’s borders are immutable.  
• Serbia’s Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić pledged Belgrade’s support for RS, while Russia’s ambassador and President Putin publicly backed the referendum.

# Republika Srpska's Attempts to Hold an Independence Referendum: A Comprehensive Timeline and Analysis  

## Summary of Key Findings  
Republika Srpska (RS), one of two entities constituting Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), has repeatedly attempted to assert greater autonomy or independence through referendums since 2011. These efforts, led by RS President Milorad Dodik and his Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), have focused on challenging the authority of BiH state institutions and international oversight. Key events include the 2011 judicial referendum proposal, the 2015–2016 State Court referendum, the 2016 National Day referendum, and ongoing secessionist rhetoric culminating in a 2024 draft law enabling future votes. Each initiative faced legal challenges from BiH Constitutional Courts, international condemnation, and eventual postponement or symbolic implementation. Comparatively, RS referendum timelines align with historic sub-national secession votes, though their legal standing remains contested under BiH’s constitutional framework[1][2][3][5][9][12].  

---

## Historical Context and Early Referendum Proposals (2011–2015)  

### 2011 Referendum on State Judicial Authority  
In April 2011, the RS National Assembly proposed a referendum to challenge the authority of BiH’s state-level judicial institutions, particularly the Court and Prosecutor’s Office[1]. RS leaders argued these bodies disproportionately targeted Serbs and violated entity sovereignty. The referendum question initially focused on rejecting the "imposed decisions" of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina (OHR), reflecting broader grievances over international oversight[1].  

The OHR, then led by Valentin Inzko, threatened to annul the referendum and dismiss Dodik if it proceeded, citing violations of the Dayton Peace Agreement[1]. The crisis de-escalated after EU High Representative Catherine Ashton brokered a compromise, replacing the referendum with a "Structured Dialogue on Justice"[1]. This episode set a precedent for RS leveraging referendums as political tools while avoiding direct confrontations with international actors[1][3].  

---

## The 2015–2016 State Court Referendum Crisis  

### Announcement and Legal Challenges  
In July 2015, the RS National Assembly voted to hold a referendum questioning the legitimacy of BiH’s State Court and Prosecutor’s Office, framed as a response to the extradition case of Bosnian Army commander Naser Oric[1][9]. The referendum question accused these institutions of enforcing "unconstitutional and illegal" laws imposed by the OHR[1]. Scheduled for November 15, 2015, the vote faced immediate legal challenges:  
- **Bosniak MPs invoked the "vital national interest" veto** in the RS Council of Peoples, but the RS Constitutional Court rejected their appeal, ruling that procedural rules required a two-thirds majority to uphold such vetos[1][9].  
- **BiH Constitutional Court interim measures**: In September 2015, the Court suspended the referendum pending a final ruling, but RS authorities ignored the order[1][3][11].  

### Postponement and Political Calculations  
Facing pressure from Serbia and the EU, Dodik indefinitely postponed the referendum in February 2016[1][7]. Analysts interpreted this move as a tactical retreat to avoid sanctions while maintaining secessionist rhetoric ahead of local elections[1][9]. Despite the postponement, the RS National Assembly never formally withdrew the referendum decision, leaving it legally dormant[3][7].  

---

## The 2016 National Day Referendum  

### Constitutional Court Ruling and RS Defiance  
On November 26, 2015, the BiH Constitutional Court ruled that RS’s National Day (January 9) was unconstitutional, as it excluded non-Serbs and commemorated the entity’s 1992 founding during the Bosnian War[1][6]. In response, the RS Assembly scheduled a referendum for September 25, 2016, asking citizens whether they supported maintaining the holiday[1][6][11].  

### International Condemnation and Implementation  
Despite a BiH Constitutional Court order on September 17, 2016, suspending the referendum, RS proceeded with the vote[3][11]. Over 99% of participants endorsed the holiday, though turnout data remains disputed[6]. The OHR and EU condemned the referendum as a violation of the Dayton Agreement, while Serbia’s leadership tacitly supported it by attending RS Day celebrations[1][3][6].  

---

## Post-2016 Escalation and the 2024 Secessionist Push  

### Legislative Preparations for Future Referendums  
In April 2024, the RS National Assembly adopted the **Law on Referendum and Citizens’ Initiative**, creating a separate legal framework to bypass BiH’s Central Election Commission[5][10]. The law lowered voter turnout thresholds, enabling referendums to pass with minimal participation—a strategic move to facilitate future independence votes[5][10].  

### Draft Agreement on "Peaceful Disassociation"  
On May 23, 2024, the RS Government approved a draft agreement proposing withdrawal from the Federation of BiH, citing "historical and civilizational maturity" for Serb self-determination[5][12]. While Dodik announced plans for an independence referendum, no specific date was set, pending "analysis and negotiations"[12].  

---

## Legal and Political Analysis of RS Referendum Attempts  

### Constitutional Violations and International Law  
Every RS referendum initiative has conflicted with BiH’s constitutional order:  
- The BiH Constitutional Court consistently ruled that entity-level referendums cannot override state institutions or international agreements[1][3][11].  
- The 2016 National Day referendum directly violated Article IX of the Dayton Agreement, which grants the Constitutional Court final authority[2][3][11].  

### Tactical Shifts in RS Strategy  
RS leadership has alternated between confrontational rhetoric and tactical delays to avoid sanctions while eroding BiH’s central authority:  
- **2011–2016**: Focused on symbolic challenges (e.g., holidays, judiciary) to test international red lines[1][6].  
- **Post-2020**: Shifted toward explicit secessionist policies, leveraging geopolitical shifts and reduced EU engagement in the Western Balkans[5][12].  

---

## Comparative Analysis: Sub-National Secession Referendum Lead Times  

### Case Study 1: Texas Secession Referendum (1861)  
The Texas secession referendum, held on February 23, 1861, was organized within three months of the state legislature’s initial vote[4]. Rapid mobilization reflected pre-existing political networks and the urgency of the U.S. Civil War context[4][8].  

### Case Study 2: Scottish Independence Referendum (2014)  
Scotland’s 2014 vote followed a seven-year process, including the 2012 Edinburgh Agreement between the UK and Scottish governments[13]. This contrasts sharply with RS’s unilateral approach, which lacks bilateral or international recognition[13].  

### Case Study 3: Catalan Independence Referendum (2017)  
Catalonia’s illegal October 1, 2017, referendum was organized in five months but lacked legal groundwork, leading to its annulment by Spain’s Constitutional Court[14]. RS’s incremental strategy mirrors Catalonia’s tactic of combining legal and extralegal measures to build political momentum[14].  

| Region           | Announcement to Vote Timeline | Legal Framework | Outcome               |  
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|  
| Republika Srpska  | 3–6 months (2016, 2024)       | Unilateral/Contested | Postponed/Non-binding |  
| Texas (1861)      | 3 months                      | State-led       | Secession ratified    |  
| Scotland (2014)   | 7 years                       | Bilateral       | Defeated (55% "No")   |  
| Catalonia (2017)  | 5 months                      | Unilateral      | Annulled              |  

---

## Conclusion: Implications for Bosnia and Regional Stability  
Republika Srpska’s referendum campaigns reflect a sustained strategy to destabilize BiH’s constitutional order and advance Serb nationalist goals. While legal challenges and international pressure have temporarily halted these efforts, the 2024 legislative changes signal preparation for a future independence vote. Historical comparisons underscore that successful secession referendums require either bilateral agreements (Scotland) or decisive military-political contexts (Texas), neither of which apply to RS. The entity’s continued defiance risks exacerbating ethnic tensions and undermining the Dayton Peace Agreement’s fragile balance.

<Summary source="https://www.nationalia.info/new/10852/over-99-of-srpska-voters-support-controversial-national-holiday-in-referendum">
Here’s a summary of the Nationalia article (Feb. 5, 2025) on the Republika Srpska holiday referendum:

• Background  
  – In 2015 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ruled the January 9 “Srpska Day” holiday illegal, on the grounds that non-religious public holidays must represent all of Bosnia’s peoples.  
  – January 9 marks both the 1992 proclamation of Republika Srpska and (on the Julian calendar) Saint Stephen’s Day, patron saint of Bosnian Serbs.  

• Referendum details  
  – President Milorad Dodik called a referendum on whether to keep January 9 as Republika Srpska’s national holiday.  
  – Held one week before local elections.  
  – Official result: 99.8% “Yes” vote to retain the holiday.  
  – Turnout was 55.8% in an entity where over 80% of residents self-identify as Serb.  

• Commentary and analysis  
  – Jasmin Mujanovic (London School of Economics): Dodik is using the holiday issue to distract from deeper problems (corruption, emigration, economic decline) and to keep political debate framed in “war-themed rhetoric.”  
  – Giovanni Vale (Balcani Caucaso): Links the referendum to Dodik’s personal political ambitions and to the influence of foreign actors in Republika Srpska.

Key facts and events

• Milorad Dodik’s referendum history  
  – 2011: First call for independence referendum, halted after EU mediation (Catherine Ashton).  
  – 2015: Republika Srpska (RS) National Assembly voted to hold an independence referendum in November; postponed amid international (EU/Dayton Agreement) and domestic opposition.

• 2016 National Day referendum  
  – Background: RS had celebrated its “National Day” on January 9 since 1992. In November 2015, Bosnia’s Constitutional Court ruled this unconstitutional (religious discrimination).  
  – Dodik’s response: appealed the ruling, then sought a referendum to reject the Court’s authority. International bodies (EU, US) warned it violated Dayton and threatened Bosnia’s cohesion.  
  – Preparations: RS police held joint exercises with Serbia; war veterans requested live ammunition drills.  
  – Referendum question (September 25, 2016): “Do you consider January 9 suitable as Statehood Day for Republika Srpska?”  
  – Result: 99.8% voted Yes. Held a week before local elections despite a temporary ban by the Constitutional Court.

• Political aftermath  
  – Local elections (early October 2016): Dodik’s SNSD won in ~30% more municipalities than in the previous cycle.  
  – Political analyst Gojko Berić (Sarajevo): “there are no real prospects of elimination of the main state disrupter…who turned out to be a radical nationalist.”  
  – Notable local results:  
     * Velika Kladuša: Fikret Abdić (convicted war criminal) elected mayor.  
     * Srebrenica: First post-war ethnic Serb mayor elected, with 51% to 48%.

Opinions and assessments

• International community (EU, US): Viewed any RS referendum—whether on National Day or independence—as a breach of the Dayton Peace Agreement, risking Bosnia and Herzegovina’s sovereignty and EU integration prospects.  
• Dodik and RS leadership: Presented referenda as asserting RS legal autonomy against allegedly biased state institutions.  
• Tabloid/media commentary: Warned of an “existential crisis” or potential return to conflict (“opening of a Pandora’s box”).  

Overall, the article portrays Dodik’s referenda—culminating in the 2016 National Day vote—as part of a broader strategy to challenge Bosnia’s post-Dayton institutional order and lay groundwork for eventual secession.

Disclaimer: The extraction below is based solely on the provided Ifimes article and may be incomplete.

1. Local elections overview
• Scheduled in all local government units except Mostar (no election there since 2008 due to unresolved SDA–HDZ BiH negotiations).  
• Republika Srpska (RS) features two main blocs:  
  – Ruling SNSD–DNS–SP coalition (Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, Democratic People’s Union, Socialist Party)  
  – “Union for Change” opposition coalition (Serb Democratic Party, Party of Democratic Progress, Democratic People’s Alliance)  
• “Union for Change” weakened by cooperation between PDP leader/Members of BiH Presidency Mladen Ivanić and SNSD leader/RS President Milorad Dodik; PDP losing voter support, Ivanić resorting to inflammatory rhetoric (“political prostitution,” per Ifimes).  

2. Federation of BiH (FBiH) and other parties  
• SDA–SBB (Party of Democratic Action–Union for a Better Future) coalition is clear favorite.  
• Social Democratic Party (SDP) on the defensive; Democratic Front (DF) positioning itself as opposition, capitalizing on government failures.  
• SBB’s future undermined by judicial prosecution of leader Fahrudin Radončić; potential leadership change could reduce SDA’s influence.  

3. Key municipalities  
• Brčko District: “training ground” for party strength in both entities; major parties staging rallies there amid reports of project delays.  
• HDZ BiH dominates Croat-majority areas.  
• Srebrenica: polls alarm due to alleged illegal addition of Serbian voters; Ifimes calls for stringent monitoring.  

4. International interference and sanctions  
• Serbia, Croatia and even Turkey actively engaged in BiH local campaigns.  
• Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković publicly backed:  
  – SNSD candidate Igor Radojičić (Banja Luka mayoral race)  
  – BDP candidate Admir Nuković in Brčko (latter described by Ifimes as “burdened with past controversies”).  
• February 2008 “tacit” U.S. sanctions: USAID, NDI and IRI suspended aid to SNSD, citing ethnic nationalism and anti–Euro-Atlantic integration stance.  
• SNSD expelled from Socialist International and Party of European Socialists; Milorad Dodik characterized as pro-Russian and corrupt by Ifimes.  
• IMF disbursed a loan tranche to FBiH and RS governments on 12 September 2016, seen as implicit support for incumbents.  
• Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić attended opening of the “9 January” motorway (named after RS National Day, ruled unconstitutional by BiH Constitutional Court). EBRD financed the €180 million project.  

5. Referendum on RS National Day  
• Republika Srpska government announced a referendum for 25 September 2016 to overturn the BiH Constitutional Court’s 9 January decision (court ruled the date unconstitutional as RS National Day).  
• Office of the High Representative Valentin Inzko and the Peace Implementation Council judge the referendum “anti-Dayton” and a threat to regional stability.  
• Milorad Dodik is pressuring the Court to reverse its ruling.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the September 25, 2016 POLITICO article “Bosnian Serbs challenge Dayton order in referendum.”

Key facts and figures
• On September 25, 2016, Republika Srpska (RS) held a non-binding referendum on whether to recognize January 9 as its official “statehood day.”  
• January 9 marks the 1992 Serb declaration of independence, which preceded the Bosnian War (100,000 killed, 1 million displaced, Srebrenica genocide).  
• Bosnia’s Constitutional Court had banned the vote on September 17 for discriminating against non-Serbs; RS authorities ignored the order— the first collective defiance of the Court.  
• RS unemployment stands at 35%, average monthly wage around €430—among Europe’s lowest.  

Statements by RS leadership  
• Milorad Dodik, RS president:  
   – Has threatened since 2006 to hold referenda on issues up to full independence (platform includes an independence vote in 2018).  
   – “If we retreat now, next year they will revoke the name of the Republika Srpska.”  
   – Urged citizens to “defend our statehood day and our freedom.”  

Domestic reactions  
• Bakir Izetbegović (Bosniak member of the tripartite presidency): calls the referendum “illegitimate and unlawful,” part of Dodik’s break-away ambitions.  
• Ramiz Salkić (Bosniak vice-president of RS): “This campaign has brought us back to the 1990s,” warning of reopened wartime wounds.  
• Reuf Bajrović (Bosniak civic-party leader in Sarajevo): describes it as a “unilateral redefinition of the Dayton Accords,” says Dodik is “banking on no reaction.”  
• Branislav Borenović (RS opposition MP): dubs the process a “useless political game,” laments neglect of economic, health-care and agricultural issues; says his party backed the vote to maintain electoral standing.  

International reactions and analysis  
• U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo: condemned the referendum, warning that Dayton “cannot be challenged without consequences,” without specifying measures.  
• Russia: Dodik met President Putin in Moscow, but the Kremlin did not mention the referendum in its statement.  
• Serbia: refrained from supporting the vote, seeking to avoid confrontation amid its EU-accession talks.  
• Miloš Solaja (political scientist, Banja Luka): argues RS’s constitution is part of an international settlement, blames the international community for failing to ensure equal treatment of Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks.  
• Stefan Blagić (political analyst, Frontal.ba): predicts the RS parliament will reclassify January 9 as a voluntary celebration rather than an obligatory holiday, in line with the Court ruling.  
• Democratization Policy Council (transatlantic think tank): calls the referendum an “election-like process … implemented and abused in a legal and procedural vacuum.”  
• Kurt Bassuener (DPC analyst): warns that the lack of enforcement by Dayton guarantors “demonstrates that this disintegration trajectory is accelerating” and will encourage other separatist agendas.  

On-the-ground atmosphere  
• Banja Luka residents largely treated it as a normal Sunday—shopping and cafés—while Bosniaks and Croats (≈20% of RS population) largely abstained.  
• The Central Election Commission in Sarajevo refused to share the voter list; no external observers monitored the vote, but a “yes” outcome was foregone.

<Summary source="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/2/18/dodiks-repeated-calls-for-republika-srpska-secession-raise-alarm">
Here is a concise summary of the Al Jazeera article “Dodik’s repeated calls for Republika Srpska secession raise alarm”:

1. Republika Srpska’s parliament has issued a 60-day deadline for reform of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Constitutional Court, demanding removal of its three foreign judges.  
2. Milorad Dodik, Serb member of Bosnia’s tripartite presidency, declared “Goodbye Bosnia, welcome RS-exit” and said Bosnian Serbs should decide their future, reiterating his ambition to organise an independence referendum within that 60-day window.  
3. Republika Srpska President Željka Cvijanović told MPs Serbs are “frustrated over constant efforts aimed at destroying their identity.”  
4. The push was sparked by a recent court ruling that unclaimed agricultural land defaults to the central state rather than Republika Srpska, in contradiction of RS law.  
5. NATO (statement to Al Jazeera) reaffirmed support for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s ongoing defence and security reforms.  
6. Valentin Inzko, the UN-mandated High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, told N1 TV he is “convinced a referendum on secession would not take place, nor would it have legal validity,” citing the Dayton Peace Agreement’s guarantee of Bosnia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  
7. Dodik denounced Western influence and said he would be “even more convinced” of Republika Srpska’s need to secede if the court issue was not resolved in 60 days.  
8. The article notes that Bosnia’s 1992–95 war claimed around 100,000 lives, and although the Dayton settlement endures, political instability and ethnic divisions persist.

Here are the relevant news articles:

**Croatia Passes Law on Cemeteries, Sparking Concerns Among Ethnic Serbs**
The Croatian parliament has passed a new law on cemeteries, which requires the removal of tombstones and plaques installed during the 1991-1995 conflict and 'not corresponding to the constitutional order'. The law bans inscriptions made during 'occupation and peaceful reintegration' and contains 'symbols that may offend the moral and feelings of citizens'. The law is aimed at tombstones made after May 30, 1990, when the first multi-party parliament was opened in the then-Socialist Republic of Croatia, marking the first step towards independence from the rest of Yugoslavia. Ethnic Serbs, supported by Belgrade and Slobodan Milosevic's nationalist regime, increasingly disagreed with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's pursuit of independence. The ethnic Serbs, who made up the largest minority in Croatia, accounting for around 12.2% of the population according to the 1991 census, soon unilaterally declared the eastern part of the country as the Republic of Serbian Krajina. By April 1991, the armed uprising had escalated into a full-scale war, with one side consisting of newly formed Croatian armed forces and the other of insurgents, paramilitary groups, and Yugoslav People's Army troops. The first clashes and sieges led to the destruction of cities such as Vukovar in northeastern Croatia and a stalemate established by the international community under the observation of UN peacekeepers. However, in 1995, the reorganized and reequipped Croatian army, as part of the 'Flash' and 'Storm' operations, ended the war, effectively expelling Serbian forces and most of the ethnic Serbian population from their territory. The new law provides for the removal of any memorials glorifying the Republic of Serbian Krajina or otherwise praising 'enemy forces', including mentioning Croatia as 'Serb land'. According to the legislation, any citizen can report a tombstone or other monument as potentially problematic. If this is established, the owners of the plots or the relatives of the deceased will be given 30 days to change the inscription. In the absence of this, they will face a fine of between 1,000 and 5,000 euros. The decision on whether a violation of the law has occurred will be made by a local commission consisting of five independent members, including a historian, art historian, and lawyer. Earlier in April, Minister of Construction, Territorial Planning, and State Property Branko Bacic stated that changes to the law were due to the fact that 'after the occupation of parts of Croatia during the war, some graves remained with monuments and memorial plaques with inappropriate inscriptions, contradicting the constitutional and legal order of the Republic of Croatia'. Representatives of the Serbian minority have condemned the new legislation, arguing that it has turned a communal issue into a political one. Deputy Milorad Pupovac from the SDSS party criticized the law, stating that it creates the impression that Croatia is 'infested with cemeteries (of Serbian nationalists)', which, in his words, does not correspond to reality. 'There are people who are bothered by symbols related to the Ustasha ideology and idea, which can be found not only on some cemeteries but also beyond them on monuments, and they offend their religious and national feelings,' he said at a parliamentary session in late April, referring to Croatian fascist collaborationist units during World War II, their tombstones, and other monuments that the law does not address. This is not the first time that Croatian authorities have tried to resolve this delicate issue. In August 2024, a judge in the city of Zadar on the Adriatic coast fined two Croatian citizens, members of a local folk group, for mentioning the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the participation of Serbs in the war. In his justification, the judge stated that 'songs of such content cause unrest among citizens, especially those who directly experienced war sufferings' and 'violate the coexistence of Croatian citizens and citizens of Serbian nationality'. Most ethnic Serbs did not return to Croatia after the 'Storm' operation, and now this minority makes up around 3.2% of Croatia's population, according to the 2021 census.

**EU Threatens Serbia Over Vucic's Planned Visit to Moscow**
The European Commission has threatened Serbia with consequences for President Alexander Vucic's planned visit to Moscow to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War II. European Commissioner for Expansion, Maros Sefcovic, stated that Vucic's participation in the Victory Day parade in Moscow would affect Serbia's efforts to join the EU. However, Vucic has stated that he will attend the event to honor the memory of the Soviet soldiers who died liberating Serbia. The EU's actions have been criticized by Russian officials, who see it as an attempt to dictate to potential member states. 'The European Commission has taken on bandit methods of doing business, blackmailing countries that want to join the EU,' said Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry. 'What will happen when a state completely submits to the will of these EU hooligans?' she asked. The EU has also threatened other countries that plan to attend the Victory Day parade in Moscow, including Slovakia and Serbia. However, some leaders have refused to back down, with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico stating that he will attend the event to honor the memory of the Soviet soldiers who died liberating Slovakia. 'I will go to Moscow to pay tribute to the thousands of Red Army soldiers who died liberating Slovakia,' he said. The situation has sparked a heated debate in Europe, with some leaders accusing the EU of trying to dictate to member states. 'The EU is trying to impose its own values and norms on us, but we will not be intimidated,' said Milorad Dodik, the president of the Republika Srpska. 'I will attend the Victory Day parade in Moscow and I will not be afraid of any sanctions from the EU,' he added.

**Kroatiens Prime Minister Plenković Supports Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU Membership**
Kroatiens Prime Minister Andrej Plenković expressed his support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership, while also expressing concern over the region's ongoing political instability. Plenković emphasized the importance of EU expansion, particularly in the Western Balkans, and highlighted Bosnia and Herzegovina's significance. 'We as Croatia would very much like to see Bosnia and Herzegovina, as our immediate neighbor, a country where Croats have the same rights as Bosniaks and Serbs, approach the dynamics that other countries in the region have. We want to help them.' However, Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership bid has been hindered by internal divisions and a complex political structure established by the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Plenković expressed particular concern over secessionist rhetoric and actions from the Republika Srpska, which he warned could lead to instability and undermine national unity. He called for a structured and dynamic EU integration process, warning that delays would allow other global powers, such as Russia and China, to exert influence in the region. Plenković hopes to put the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership on the agenda of the European Council in June.

**Croatia Supports Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU Accession Amid Regional Instability**
Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković expressed his strong support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the European Union, while expressing concern over the existing political instability in the region. Plenković emphasized that EU expansion should be a strategic priority, especially in the Western Balkans. He highlighted the importance of Bosnia and Herzegovina, saying, 'We would like to see Bosnia and Herzegovina, as our immediate neighbor, a country where Croats are constituents and people with the same rights as Bosnians and Serbs, moving towards the dynamics that other countries in the region have, which we want to help.' Bosnia and Herzegovina has been aspiring to join the EU for a long time, but its progress has been hindered by deep internal divisions and a complex political structure created by the Dayton Accords of 1995. Plenković expressed special concern over secessionist rhetoric and actions from the Republika Srpska, previously led by nationalist leader Milorad Dodik. He warned that delays in EU integration open the door for other global powers to expand their influence in the region, saying, 'The slower the process, the more influence other global actors will have in the region, whether it's Russia, China, or other countries. That's why we advocate for a structured and dynamic process.' Plenković wants the issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU accession and the broader future of the Western Balkans to be on the agenda of the June European Council meeting.

**Croatia Supports Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU Membership**
Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic expressed strong support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the European Union in an exclusive interview with Euronews, while also expressing concern about the ongoing political instability in the region. Plenkovic emphasized that EU expansion in the Western Balkans should be a strategic priority. He said, 'As Croatia, we want Bosnia and Herzegovina to have the same dynamics as other countries in the region and to help them, as a country where Croats, Bosniaks, and Serbs have equal rights.' Bosnia and Herzegovina has long sought to join the EU, but deep internal divisions and the complex political structure created by the 1995 Dayton Agreement have hindered progress. The country is divided into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBIH) and the Republika Srpska (RS), which has been led by nationalist leader Milorad Dodik. Plenkovic expressed particular concern about the separatist rhetoric and actions from the Republika Srpska. He said, 'We want Bosnia and Herzegovina to move away from potential instability. The tendencies of separation in the Republika Srpska, in the context of Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU path and the implementation of reforms that are beneficial to citizens in both economic and social terms, would lead to a more harmonious and functional situation.' Plenkovic warned that delays in the EU integration process would allow other global powers to increase their influence in the region. He said, 'The slower the process, the more influence other global actors, whether it's Russia, China, or other countries, will have in the region. That's why we are defending a structured and dynamic process.' Plenkovic hopes that the issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership and the future of the Western Balkans will be on the agenda of the European Council meeting in June.

**Kroatiens Prime Minister Plenković Supports Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU Membership**
Kroatiens Prime Minister Andrej Plenković expressed his support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership, while also expressing concern over the region's ongoing political instability. Plenković emphasized the importance of EU expansion, particularly in the Western Balkans, and highlighted Bosnia and Herzegovina's significance. 'We as Croatia would very much like to see Bosnia and Herzegovina, as our immediate neighbor, a country where Croats have the same rights as Bosniaks and Serbs, approach the dynamics that other countries in the region have. We want to help them.' However, Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership bid has been hindered by internal divisions and a complex political structure established by the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Plenković expressed particular concern over secessionist rhetoric and actions from the Republika Srpska, which he warned could lead to instability and undermine national unity. He called for a structured and dynamic EU integration process, warning that delays would allow other global powers, such as Russia and China, to exert influence in the region. Plenković hopes to put the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership on the agenda of the European Council in June.

**Croatia Supports Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU Membership**
Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic expressed strong support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the European Union in an exclusive interview with Euronews, while also expressing concern about the ongoing political instability in the region. Plenkovic emphasized that EU expansion in the Western Balkans should be a strategic priority. He said, 'As Croatia, we want Bosnia and Herzegovina to have the same dynamics as other countries in the region and to help them, as a country where Croats, Bosniaks, and Serbs have equal rights.' Bosnia and Herzegovina has long sought to join the EU, but deep internal divisions and the complex political structure created by the 1995 Dayton Agreement have hindered progress. The country is divided into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBIH) and the Republika Srpska (RS), which has been led by nationalist leader Milorad Dodik. Plenkovic expressed particular concern about the separatist rhetoric and actions from the Republika Srpska. He said, 'We want Bosnia and Herzegovina to move away from potential instability. The tendencies of separation in the Republika Srpska, in the context of Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU path and the implementation of reforms that are beneficial to citizens in both economic and social terms, would lead to a more harmonious and functional situation.' Plenkovic warned that delays in the EU integration process would allow other global powers to increase their influence in the region. He said, 'The slower the process, the more influence other global actors, whether it's Russia, China, or other countries, will have in the region. That's why we are defending a structured and dynamic process.' Plenkovic hopes that the issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership and the future of the Western Balkans will be on the agenda of the European Council meeting in June.

**New CBOS Survey: Civic Coalition and Law and Justice Tied, Confederation on Podium**
According to a new CBOS survey, if parliamentary elections were held at the end of April, the Civic Coalition and Law and Justice would have the same level of support, with 32% each. The Confederation would also be on the podium. The Civic Coalition's support has decreased by 1 percentage point since the beginning of April, while Law and Justice's support has increased by 6 percentage points. 'The end of the election campaign before the first round of presidential elections is beneficial for the current opposition, i.e. Law and Justice,' CBOS noted. The Confederation has 15% support, a decrease of 1 percentage point from the previous survey. The Third Way (PSL and Polska 2050) and the Left would also enter the Sejm with 6% and 5% support, respectively. The party Razem would be below the electoral threshold with 4% support, the same as at the beginning of April. 7% of respondents were unable to answer, a decrease from 9% at the beginning of April. 90% of respondents would go to the polls, an increase of 1 percentage point from the previous survey.

**New Survey Shows Tight Race Between Civic Coalition and Law and Justice**
According to a new CBOS survey, if parliamentary elections were held at the end of April, the Civic Coalition (KO) and Law and Justice (PiS) would likely receive a tie in voter support at 32%. However, PiS is closing the gap with the ruling party. The Confederation party is in third place with 15% support. The survey also found that 90% of respondents would vote, a 1% increase from the previous month. Rafał Trzaskowski is breathing a sigh of relief, but Karol Nawrocki is still fighting for the top spot. 'The end of the election campaign before the first round of the presidential election is beneficial for the current opposition, i.e. PiS,' noted CBOS. 'We need to put a stop to Grzegorz Braun's actions,' said Nawrocki. 'It's time to put a damper on things.'

**Republic of Srpska: Classes suspended, the 1st level of preparedness for flood protection has been declared**
Classes have been suspended in all schools in the city of Derventa in the Republika Srpska due to the increased water level of the Ukrina River. The first level of preparedness for flood protection has been declared in the area of Prijedor after the water levels of Sana and Gomjenica rose by more than two meters. The river Bosna in Doboj is rising and has flooded the coastal land, with a water level of 388 centimeters, 88 centimeters above the regular flood protection level. Several road routes are impassable, including part of the Gradiška-Banjaluka highway, according to the Automobile Association of the Republic of Srpska.

**Republic of Srpska's Independence Day Referendum Sparks Controversy**
The Republic of Srpska, one of the two federal entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is preparing for a referendum on the question of preserving its independence day, which is celebrated on January 9. The referendum is scheduled for Sunday. The head of the Republic of Srpska, Milorad Dodik, believes that any nation has the right to hold a referendum: 'It's simply incredible that someone called this a 'referendum on withdrawal' from the country. This is far from the case. It's not even about starting such a process. In this region, a referendum cannot be an instrument of decision-making. It's acceptable in some other countries, like Britain, but not here. I'm surprised that the British ambassador criticizes the idea of a referendum in our country, while in his own country there are no problems with it. So, it's okay there, but not here. Anyway, the situation has already escalated to hysteria.' The Republic of Srpska, established after the bloody war in Bosnia in 1995, based on the Dayton Agreement, maintains close ties with both Belgrade and Moscow. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić said: 'Serbia has always and will always support the Republic of Srpska. It's our right, our pride, and our duty. Anyone who wants to occupy the Republic of Srpska should know that Serbia will always stand up for it.' The idea of the referendum in the Republic of Srpska is met with outrage by the representative of the Bosnian Muslims in the highest authority of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bakir Izetbegović. He believes that this vote is a test of strength before another referendum on the withdrawal of Serbian autonomy from the country: 'There are people - like the leaders of the Republic of Srpska - who always want more than they already have. They already control part of our country, but we won't allow them to discriminate against part of the population. They must obey our constitution and laws, and be content with the level of autonomy they have. I fear that if we start talking about greater autonomy, it will be an adventure, the situation will get out of control, and those who 'stir this mess' will not be happy about it.'

**Ruling Coalition in Republic of Srpska to Hold Mayor Accountable**
The ruling coalition in the Republic of Srpska has announced plans to hold the mayor of Banja Luka, Drasko Stanivukovic, accountable for his actions. According to Goran Selak, the leader of the Socialist Party of the Republic of Srpska, the coalition will 'bring the mayor back into the legal framework' by holding him accountable. The coalition has scheduled a meeting with the leaders of the city committees of the parties that make up the coalition, where they will discuss the functioning of the city and the formation of a majority in the city assembly. Selak stated that the city has been in a state of disrepair for over 100 days, with issues such as snow, trash, and chaos plaguing the city. He emphasized that the people who want to see Banja Luka move forward will be gathering today, January 22. Selak also noted that the 'City Assembly', which has 31 advisors, received twice as many votes as the mayor in the last election, and that this is a call from the citizens for the institution to function. He added that the mayor will be required to submit reports on his work. 'The citizens must know where Stanivukovic spent the billion convertible marks in the previous term,' Selak said.

**European Countries to Hold Elections in 2025: A Year of Change for the EU**
In 2025, several European countries will hold elections that could change the European Union. The year will be marked by a series of votes in various countries, facing challenges such as the growth of the far-right, disinformation, and manipulation associated with artificial intelligence, a decline in civic rights, wars, and economic recessions. Croatia is the country that will hold elections first, with the second round of presidential elections scheduled for January 12. The current President, Zoran Milanović, is running as an independent candidate, backed by a coalition led by the Social Democratic Party. In the first round, Milanović obtained 49.20% of the votes, surpassing Dragan Primorac with 19.43%. Milanović, who describes himself as 'nationalist', opposes the Croatian government's support for Ukraine and the participation of soldiers in the NATO mission to train Ukrainian military personnel. In January 26, presidential elections will be held in Belarus, where Alexander Lukashenko is running for a seventh term as president. The elections have been marked by accusations of fraud, repression of the opposition, and massive protests, which the regime responded to with violence. In February 23, legislative elections will be held in Germany, where the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is expected to gain 20.5% of the vote, behind the CDU/CSU party led by Friedrich Merz. Merz advocates for a more liberal economic policy and conservative positions on issues such as migration. In March 4, presidential elections will be held in Kosovo, where the Vetëvendosje (Autodetermination) movement, led by Prime Minister Albin Kurti, is expected to win. The main issue will be whether the party can secure a majority or will need to negotiate coalitions, possibly with the Srpska Lista, the main party of the Serbian community. The Srpska Lista has close ties with Serbia, which does not recognize Kosovo's independence, declared in 2008 and supported by the main Western powers. In March 23, presidential elections will be held in Romania, where the country will hold new presidential elections after the first round, held on November 24, was annulled by the Constitutional Court due to allegations of Russian interference. In May 1, local elections will be held in the UK, which will serve as a test of the popularity of the Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, after their victory in the general elections on July 4, 2024. In May 11, legislative elections will be held in Albania, where the Socialist Party, in power, and the Democratic Party will be in play. In May 18, presidential elections will be held in Poland, where the first round will take place. The presidential election is a confrontation between the candidates of the two main parties: Rafał Trzaskowski, president of the Warsaw City Council for the Civic Platform (PO), and Karol Nawrocki, a historian, who will represent the PiS. Although the race is fierce, opinion polls suggest that the Civic Platform will emerge victorious. In July 11, legislative elections will be held in Moldova, where the country faces a scenario of political instability and attempts at Russian interference. The Action and Solidarity Party, led by President Maia Sandu, will try to secure a parliamentary majority, in a context of tension between pro-Europeans and pro-Russians. In September, regional elections will be held in Italy, where several regions - Apulia, Campania, Marche, Tuscany, Aosta Valley, and Veneto - will elect their regional governments. In September 8, legislative elections will be held in Norway, where the Norwegians will elect the 169 members of the Storting, the national parliament, defining who will occupy the position of prime minister. In September 14, elections will be held in Russia, where voters will participate in elections to fill places in the Duma (lower house of parliament), to elect governors in 18 regions, representatives in 11 regional parliaments, and local councils in various areas. In October, legislative elections will be held in the Czech Republic, which may consolidate a populist turn in the country. The ANO movement, led by Andrej Babiš, emerges in the polls with 34.5% of the votes, ahead of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala, with 13.7%, and the STAN party, a center-right party, with 11%. Babiš, often referred to as 'Czech Trump', is known for his anti-elite and anti-immigration rhetoric. In October, presidential elections will be held in Ireland, which will mark the end of President Michael D. Higgins' 14-year term. Although the role is largely ceremonial, the constitutional responsibilities of the President give weight to this election. Speculation suggests that well-known European politicians may run, such as former European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness and former European Parliament member Frances Fitzgerald - both from the center-right Fine Gael party. Simultaneously, the Seanad, the upper house of parliament, will be renewed through a process that combines election and appointment. In October, municipal elections will be held in Georgia, which will take place in a climate of political tension, a year after the controversial victory of the Sonho Georgiano party in the 2024 legislative elections. The government, widely accused of alignment with Russia, decided to postpone the accession process to the European Union until 2028, triggering protests in various cities. The new President, former pro-Russian footballer Mikheil Kavelashvili, took office in December 2024, after an election boycotted by the opposition. The former President, Salome Zurabishvili, a pro-European, refuses to recognize the result, maintaining a posture of resistance. With 20% of the territory occupied by Russia, Georgia continues to be divided between the influences of Moscow and the West, with the opposition facing increasing repression. Georgia is one of the nine countries currently recognized as candidates for accession to the EU, along with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.

**Republika Srpska Holds Parade To Mark Banned Independence Day**
Despite being declared unconstitutional by Bosnia's Constitutional Court three times, Republika Srpska held a parade on January 9 to mark the banned Independence Day. The event, which included former soldiers, students, and representatives of rescue services and police departments, was attended by Serbian Defense Minister Bratislav Gasic and Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin. Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik, who is recovering from surgery, was not present. The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo warned that disobeying the Constitutional Court's decision may constitute a criminal offense and called for an investigation. The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on three individuals for their role in organizing last year's parade. Republika Srpska Interior Minister Sinisa Karan said that after the end of proceedings against Dodik, 'it will be known whether the Dayton peace agreement and Bosnia will survive.'

**Republic of Srpska to Sign Long-Term Contract with Gazprom**
The Republic of Srpska is planning to sign a long-term contract with Gazprom for the supply of Russian gas. The current contract expires in 2025, and the authorities of the Republic of Srpska consider its conditions to be beneficial. The growing industry of the Republic of Srpska requires an increase in gas supplies, but Sarajevo blocks the construction of a new gas pipeline from Serbia. Belgrade, whose contract with Gazprom expires in March 2025, is also negotiating a new agreement. Experts believe that possible sanctions from the West will not affect the conclusion of contracts with Balkan republics. In fact, they have become more beneficial economically than countries that previously received Russian gas through Ukraine. The Republic of Srpska receives gas from Russia through the 'Turkish Stream' pipeline, then through Bulgaria through the gas transportation system built for the supply of gas to European consumers. In 2023, Banja Luka signed a contract with Gazprom until 2025, with payments made in rubles at a favorable price for the republic. Gazprom may conclude a long-term contract with the Republic of Srpska, believes expert Stanislav Mitrahovich. 'I don't see any obstacles here. I think our cooperation will be relevant. In the future, if Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes an EU member, such obstacles may arise,' he said. The volume of gas supplies to the Republic of Srpska may reach 1-1.5 billion cubic meters, noted Alexander Novak earlier. To increase supplies, a new gas pipeline from Serbia to the Republic of Srpska needs to be built, but Sarajevo has blocked this project for over 15 years. The Republic of Srpska needs more gas to develop its industry, which accounts for about 20% of the republic's GDP. A long-term gas contract with Gazprom can be seen as a tool for ensuring the republic's economic independence. However, the Republic of Srpska's exit from Bosnia and Herzegovina remains unlikely in the near future, said Milan Lazovich, program manager of the Russian Council on International Affairs. The scenario would lead to a violation of the Dayton Accords and destabilization of the situation in the region. If this were to happen, Serbia would be forced to increase support for Bosnian Serbs, for example, by forming a union state in the format of Russia and Belarus or by incorporating them into its own territory. The situation is complicated by the fact that the current gas contract between Gazprom and Serbia expires in March 2025, and Belgrade is already negotiating a new agreement until 2028. The overall gas consumption in Serbia in 2023 was 2.8 billion cubic meters, said Dusan Bayatovic, director of the company Srbijagas. The republic needs more blue fuel due to its growing economy: the country's GDP growth in 2023 was 3.8%, in the first and second quarters of 2024 - 4.5%. In late 2024, Serbian President Alexander Vucic announced that Serbia would introduce sanctions against the Serbian oil and gas company NIS, 56.15% of whose shares are owned by Russian Gazprom Neft and Gazprom. To avoid the introduction of restrictions, Vucic proposed buying out the shares of Gazprom and Gazprom Neft in NIS for about €600 million. However, possible sanctions will not affect the conclusion of gas contracts with Russia, as this is handled by the company Srbijagas, said Alexander Frolov. The situation is complicated by the fact that countries importing gas from Russia through the 'Turkish Stream' pipeline have become more beneficial than those that previously received fuel through Ukraine. In 2023, Ukraine refused to extend the transit agreement with Gazprom, and from January 1, Moldova and Transnistria were left without Russian pipeline gas. In the past year, the European market lost about 15 billion cubic meters of gas annually. On the background of the Ukrainian transit stop, the European gas price exceeded $500 per 1,000 cubic meters for the first time since 2023. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico earlier pointed out the possibility of increasing gas prices in Europe, which would lead to annual losses for the EU of €60-70 billion. The situation is complicated by the fact that some European countries are trying to influence Ukraine. On January 9, Robert Fico met with EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen, but Ukrainian representatives did not participate. Slovakia threatened Ukraine with retaliatory measures for stopping the transit of Russian gas. As Reuters notes, Fico said that besides reducing aid to Ukrainian refugees, Bratislava may stop emergency electricity supplies, humanitarian aid, and block necessary votes for Kiev in the EU. Ukraine's decision to stop gas transit to Europe is condemned by Hungary as well. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto earlier emphasized that it contradicts Kiev's desire to join the EU.

**Dodik: Today we celebrate our sovereignty, identity and tradition**
Republika Srpska celebrates its sovereignty, identity, and tradition on its 33rd anniversary, according to President Milorad Dodik. Dodik stated, 'Today, on the day when Republika Srpska was honourably founded and proclaimed 33 years ago, we celebrate more than one date – we celebrate our sovereignty, identity and tradition.'

**Dodik: Our Political Goal is the Independence of RS, if America is Neutral we know what we will decide**
Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik reiterated his secessionist plans, stating that the political goal of the current government is the independence and autonomy of Republika Srpska. He emphasized that the US administration's decisions have hit companies, banks, and citizens, and that there was pressure related to property, but it was also stopped. Dodik said that Republika Srpska is not naive to think that the US will stop putting pressure, but they believe that everyone has understood that they will not allow the seizure of property. He stated that the independence and autonomy of Republika Srpska is the political goal, and that they expect a better situation for RS with the new US President Donald Trump. Dodik said that Republika Srpska has some friends in the US and that they influenced Serbs in the US to vote for Trump. He stressed that Republika Srpska's goal is a neutral position for America, saying 'I expect the Americans to say that they are leaving it to the people of BiH to decide the fate of the country, and we know what we will decide.'

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Nationalia (Feb 2025)**: Recent article describing RS's banned entity-day celebrations and Milorad Dodik's nationalist stance. Notes Dodik's goal of creating a pathway to RS secession but confirms no referendum date has been set as of February 2025. Contains factual information about geopolitical alignments and named expert opinions from US Secretary Albright.

2. **Wikipedia (April 2019)**: Provides historical context on RS secession proposals from 1996-2016. Though outdated, it documents a pattern of referendum threats followed by postponements. Includes credible named expert opinions from former CIA Balkans chief Steven Meyer and High Representatives Lajčák and Inzko on RS's legal inability to secede.

3. **Biztonságpolitika (Feb 2021)**: Hungarian security policy publication chronicling RS independence movements through February 2020. Documents how RS Serb deputies suspended participation in state institutions following a Constitutional Court ruling. Contains factual timelines and named official statements.

4. **Newsweek (Sept 2016)**: Covers the 2016 "Statehood Day" referendum that defied Constitutional Court rulings. While not about independence directly, demonstrates RS's willingness to defy central authority and provides official international reactions from the US Embassy, EU, Serbia, and Russia.

5. **Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (Sept 2016)**: Two articles on the 2016 referendum, framing it as a "dress rehearsal" for secession. Includes statements from Bosnian Army commander Halilović warning against secession and Serbian leadership responses. As US government-funded media, maintains editorial independence but with a Western perspective.

6. **Perplexity report (May 2024)**: Most recent and comprehensive analysis, detailing RS referendum attempts from 2011 to May 2024. Critically notes that in April 2024, the RS National Assembly adopted a "Law on Referendum and Citizens' Initiative" creating a separate legal framework, and in May 2024 approved a draft agreement proposing withdrawal from Bosnia. States Dodik announced plans for an independence referendum but set no specific date as of May 2024.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several potential reference classes exist:

1. **Previous RS referendum announcements (2008-2024)**: Multiple instances where Dodik threatened independence referendums without setting dates. When faced with international pressure, he typically retreats or shifts to less provocative issues.

2. **Sub-national independence referendums globally**: The Perplexity report compares timelines for referendums in Texas (3 months), Scotland (7 years), and Catalonia (5 months).

3. **RS's defiance of Constitutional Court rulings**: The 2016 National Day referendum proceeded despite being ruled unconstitutional.

The most suitable reference class is **previous RS referendum announcements**, as these involve the same political entity, leadership, and constitutional constraints. This shows a pattern of threats rarely progressing to date-setting for independence votes.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is approximately 2 months (May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025).

Historical patterns show:
- The 2015 announced referendum was postponed after 7 months
- The 2016 Statehood Day referendum took about 10 months from announcement to implementation
- RS referendum timelines typically range from 3-6 months (Perplexity report)

Most critically, as of May 2024, Dodik announced plans for an independence referendum but set no date, pending "analysis and negotiations." We have a one-year information gap from May 2024 to May 2025, during which preparations may have advanced.

## (d) Justification:

Several factors inform my outside view prediction:

1. **Historical precedent suggests low probability**: Despite numerous threats since 2008, Dodik has never scheduled a date for an independence referendum. When facing international pressure, he typically retreats or pivots to less provocative issues.

2. **Recent legal preparations increase probability**: The April 2024 referendum law and May 2024 draft "peaceful disassociation" agreement represent concrete steps beyond previous rhetoric. These legal changes specifically removed procedural obstacles to holding such a vote.

3. **International context remains constraining**: Previous referendum attempts faced strong opposition from the EU, US, and even Serbia. This has been a major historical constraint, though current international positions (as of 2025) aren't detailed in our sources.

4. **New legal framework exists**: Unlike previous instances, RS now has a dedicated legal framework for referendums (established April 2024), making an announcement procedurally feasible.

5. **Unknown developments May 2024-May 2025**: A critical information gap exists in our sources. If preparations continued advancing during this period, the probability increases substantially.

## Outside view calibration:

The historical pattern of Dodik threatening independence referendums without setting dates suggests a low base rate, perhaps 10-20%. However, the 2024 legal preparations (referendum law and draft disassociation agreement) represent unprecedented concrete steps that significantly increase this probability.

The two-month window is relatively short but sufficient for an announcement if preparations have continued since May 2024.

No precise figure appears in the sources, but we can calibrate based on:
1. The complete absence of any scheduled independence referendum dates in RS's history (suggesting <20%)
2. The unprecedented legal preparations in 2024 (suggesting a substantial increase)
3. Dodik's explicit statement in 2024 that independence referendum plans were pending "analysis and negotiations"

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Nationalia (February 2025)**: Recent article discussing Republika Srpska's controversial anniversary celebrations. Details Milorad Dodik's transformation from moderate to nationalist figure who routinely blocks Bosnian state institutions with aims toward RS secession. Factually reports on RS demographics and development, but contains clear anti-Dodik editorial framing. Notably mentions no official referendum date has been set as of early 2025.

2. **Wikipedia: Proposed Secession (2019)**: Provides comprehensive historical context on secession proposals (1996-2016). Documents multiple instances where RS leaders threatened referendums that were later postponed under international pressure. Reports 2010 Gallup polling showing 88% support among Bosnian Serbs for independence. Cites named experts like Steven Meyer (former CIA) and international officials like High Representatives Lajčák and Inzko opposing secession. Generally balanced.

3. **Biztonságpolitika (February 2021)**: Chronicles Dodik's independence initiatives from 1996-2020, highlighting the pattern of referendum threats followed by postponements when faced with international opposition. Reports Dodik's 2012 public declaration that RS would become independent, and subsequent party platform making independence official policy by 2015. Factually oriented with minimal bias.

4. **Newsweek/Reuters (September 2016)**: Reports on the 2016 "Statehood Day" referendum that defied Constitutional Court rulings. Features quotes from U.S. Embassy and international stakeholders opposing the referendum, balanced by local voices supporting it. Indicates Dodik used this referendum as groundwork for potential future secession, but quoted him saying "secession is not on our short-term agenda."

5. **RFE/RL "Politics of Fear" (September 2016)**: Analysis of the 2016 Statehood Day referendum, framing it as a "dress rehearsal" for secession. More editorial than other sources, critically examining Serbian nationalistic narratives while documenting regional responses. Contains valuable quotes from Serbian PM Vučić affirming Bosnia's territorial integrity.

6. **RFE/RL "Balkan Tensions" (September 2016)**: Post-referendum coverage reporting 99.8% support with 56-60% turnout. Includes important quotes from RS officials and international responses. Factually oriented reporting with minimal bias.

7. **Perplexity Report (May 2024)**: Comprehensive analysis including recent developments not covered in other sources: April 2024 RS adoption of a new referendum law creating a separate legal framework, and May 2024 government approval of a draft "peaceful disassociation" agreement. Contextualizes RS's attempts through comparative analysis with other secession referendums worldwide. AI-generated but well-sourced.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Three potential reference classes are relevant:

1. **Previous RS referendum announcements**: Since 1996, RS has repeatedly threatened independence referendums without following through, except for the 2016 symbolic "Statehood Day" referendum. This pattern shows Dodik using referendums as political leverage rather than with immediate implementation intent.

2. **Successful secession referendums globally**: Cases like Montenegro (2006) and Scotland (2014) demonstrate that successful/legitimate secession votes typically require months/years of preparation, international engagement, and legal frameworks.

3. **Failed/blocked secession attempts**: Cases like Catalonia (2017) where unilateral approaches faced legal challenges and international opposition.

The first reference class (previous RS referendum announcements) is most appropriate given the identical political, geographical, and leadership context.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The forecasting window is May 2-July 1, 2025 (approximately 60 days). Historical patterns show:

- 2015 State Court referendum: Announced July 2015, scheduled for November 2015, postponed February 2016 (7+ month process)
- 2016 Statehood Day referendum: Court ruling November 2015, referendum held September 2016 (10-month process)
- 2018 proposed independence referendum: Announced 2015, postponed 2017 before date was ever set

The Perplexity report notes typical timelines for secession referendum announcements to votes range from 3-7 months (with exceptions). The compressed timeframe of less than 60 days would be exceptionally short for such a consequential decision, especially given the May 2024 draft agreement indicated the need for "analysis and negotiations" before setting a date.

## (d) Justification:

The evidence strongly suggests a low probability of RS announcing an independence referendum date before July 1, 2025:

1. **Consistent historical pattern**: For almost 30 years, RS leaders have threatened independence referendums but consistently backed down under international pressure.

2. **International opposition remains strong**: The US, EU, and international bodies continue to oppose RS independence and have previously successfully pressured RS to abandon referendum plans.

3. **Recent actions suggest preparation without immediacy**: The April 2024 referendum law and May 2024 draft agreement represent preparation for potential future action rather than imminent scheduling.

4. **Compressed timeframe**: With less than 60 days remaining until the deadline, the timeline would be extraordinarily compressed based on historical precedents.

5. **Tactical political use**: Dodik's documented pattern shows referendum threats used primarily as political leverage rather than with immediate implementation intent.

However, factors increasing probability include:
- More concrete preparatory steps taken in 2024 than previous cycles
- The successful precedent of the 2016 referendum despite international opposition
- Potential shifts in international attention and influence

## Outside view calibration:

Looking at the historical pattern, in approximately 30 years of RS history, there have been at least 5-6 serious proposals or threats to hold independence referendums, but none have actually resulted in an official date being set for such a vote. The only referendum that proceeded (2016 Statehood Day) was on a less contentious symbolic issue.

Given that approximately 11 months have passed since the May 2024 draft "peaceful disassociation" agreement without a date being set, and considering the typical 3-7 month timeframe for organizing such referendums, the compressed 60-day window further reduces the probability.

The base rate from the historical pattern suggests approximately 10-15% chance of moving forward with setting a date in any given referendum threat cycle. Given the specific short timeframe and other contextual factors, I believe the probability is even lower than this base rate.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Nationalia (Feb 2025): A regional outlet covering RS’s banned Statehood Day parade. Facts: NSR marks entity-day defiantly; Dodik’s nationalist turn; external backers (Hungary, Russia). Opinion: local hard-liners see these steps as “dress rehearsal” for secession. Quality: Medium—good factual detail on RS symbolism, but local analysts may overstate imminence of a referendum.  
- Wikipedia “Proposed secession of RS” (Apr 2019): Chronology of RS’s flirtations with a referendum (1996, 2006, 2008, 2015–16). Facts: assembly resolutions passed then postponed or blocked; strong legal/international opposition. Opinion sections exist but mostly attributed to named experts. Quality: Medium–High for broad chronology, but dated (no developments since 2019).  
- Biztonságpolitika (Feb 2021): Security-studies perspective on RS’s failed bids (1996, 2008, 2011, 2015–17). Facts: Dodik’s party program in 2015–17, indefinite postponement of 2018 vote; recent suspensions of RS participation in state bodies post-2020. Opinions largely expert (Lajčák, U.S./EU officials). Quality: Medium–High for the period it covers, but no coverage past early 2021.  
- Newsweek/Reuters (Sept 2016): Coverage of RS’s 2016 defiance on Statehood Day referendum (not independence). Facts: RS held a local identity vote; high turnout claims; U.S./EU condemnation; Russia’s support. Opinion: quoted local veteran, diplomats. Quality: High for event reporting, but not directly about independence referendum.  
- RFE/RL – two articles (Sept 2016): Detailed reporting on the Statehood Day vote as a litmus test for secession. Facts: turnout, court rulings defied, media narratives. Opinion: commentary by fringe Bosniak general, director Kusturica. Quality: High for 2016 events but focused on identity referendum, not a date for independence plebiscite.  
- Perplexity report: AI-generated timeline of RS referendum attempts up to 2024. Contains many invented or unverified citations (e.g., “UN Document S/2024/777”). Quality: Low to Questionable—use factual fragments with caution; synthetic conclusions should be discounted unless corroborated.

Summary of factual situation:
• RS leadership has passed multiple resolutions (2006, 2008, 2015) to hold independence votes but repeatedly postponed them under international pressure.  
• In 2016, RS held a symbolic “Statehood Day” vote—viewed as a rehearsal for secession—but did not schedule an actual independence referendum.  
• As of spring 2025, RS has drafted a new referendum law (2024) lowering turnout thresholds, and Dodik has signaled intent to hold a vote, but no official date has been announced.

2. Reference class analysis  
Potential classes:  
a. RS’s own history of referendum intentions: 0/4 attempts actually scheduled. This suggests a near-zero baseline.  
b. Subnational secession referendums in Europe in the past 25 years (Catalonia, Scotland, Veneto, Lombardy): only Scotland (bilaterally agreed) and Catalonia (unilateral, legally blocked) actually set dates. Of ~10 such movements, 2 set dates. Baseline ~20%.  
c. Global provincial secession votes under legal constraints: success rate ~10–15% of movements both announce and hold votes within 2 years.  
Most suitable: the class of European secessionist regions that lack central government consent (e.g., Catalonia, RS). Within that class, unilateral secession referendums get scheduled ~20% of the time; but RS has consistently postponed, so its personal baseline is lower, around 5–10%.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Time left: ~60 days until July 1, 2025. Historical patterns: RS announces referendums several months in advance to allow for campaigning and international posturing. The December 2023 draft law still lacked a date by March/April 2025. A 60-day window is very tight for RS’s legislative and administrative processes to fix a date, print ballots, set up commissions, and weather potential legal injunctions.

4. Justification for outside view  
- RS’s track record: Four high-profile referendum initiatives in 20 years; zero scheduled independence votes. Each bid either fizzled or was indefinitely postponed.  
- International/legal restraints: Bosnia’s Constitutional Court, the Dayton framework, and EU/U.S. opposition consistently imposed de facto moratoria on any official scheduling.  
- Domestic politics: Dodik uses referendum threats as leverage, not out-and-out commitments. RS public statements signal desire but no concrete timetable.  
- Reference-class: Among European regions that lack central approval, unilateral secession referendums are rare and face legal blocks (~20% announcement rate); RS’s personal baseline is even lower (~5–10%).  
- Time constraints: Only two months remain—too short to overcome legal challenges and bureaucratic hurdles.

Outside view calibration:  
Given RS’s zero-for-four history, the tight 60-day window, and the strong legal/international barriers, I place the baseline probability in the lower end of the reference-class range. Adjusting for some increased momentum post-2024 referendum law but no concrete follow-through by May 2025, I estimate roughly an 8% chance that RS will officially announce a referendum date before July 1, 2025.

Outside View Prediction:
There is an 8% probability that before July 1, 2025, the government of Republika Srpska will officially announce a date for an independence referendum.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
1.1 Nationalia (Feb 2025)  
  • Type: Regional opinion/analysis piece.  
  • Facts: RS marks entity day, has defied Bosnia’s Constitutional Court since 2015; Dodik is ultra-nationalist, seeking US/Hungarian/Russian support for secession.  
  • Opinions: Hard-line nationalists view these steps as de facto preparation for a referendum. Lacks named expert commentary; leans local.  
  • Reliability: Medium. Useful on RS domestic symbolism and Dodik’s posture, but partial and not focused on formal scheduling mechanics.  

1.2 Wikipedia “Proposed secession of RS” (Apr 2019)  
  • Type: Secondary summary.  
  • Facts: Chronology of assembly resolutions (1996, 2006, 2008, 2015–17), expert views (CIA, BMI Research), all independence referendums floated but never held.  
  • Opinions: Expert assessments (Steven Meyer, BMI Research) give baseline views on likelihood of formal independence within 5–10 years. Clearly labeled.  
  • Reliability: Medium–high for factual chronology; dated for current state.  

1.3 Biztonságpolitika (Feb 2021)  
  • Type: Analytical article.  
  • Facts: RS leadership’s repeated referendum initiatives in 2008, 2011, 2015–17; legal pushback in BiH courts; post-2020 constitutional-court tensions; defiance of state institutions.  
  • Opinions: Quotes Lajčák, U.S./EU officials. Reasonably balanced.  
  • Reliability: High for factual recap, though prior to 2025 developments.  

1.4 Newsweek/Reuters (Sept 2016)  
  • Type: Newswire.  
  • Facts: RS scheduled a Jan 9 “statehood day” referendum in defiance of court; turnout figures; international reactions (U.S., EU, Serbia, Russia).  
  • Opinions: Minimal; mostly attributed.  
  • Reliability: High for events, but 2016 dated.  

1.5 RFE/RL (Sept 2016, two articles)  
  • Type: Reporting/analysis.  
  • Facts: Mechanics of 2016 vote, propaganda tactics, political aftermath, actors’ statements (Halilović, Vučić, Kusturica).  
  • Opinions: Clearly attributed.  
  • Reliability: High for 2016 context; dated for 2025 forecast.  

1.6 Perplexity report (various sources, May 2024)  
  • Type: AI-generated synthesis of multiple documents, some UN, OHR, academic studies.  
  • Facts: Detailed timeline of referendum proposals (2011–2016), legal pushback, postponements, 2024 draft referendum law, “peaceful disassociation” draft.  
  • Opinions: Scattered expert quotes, but extraction may be synthetic or mis-dated.  
  • Reliability: Low–medium. Useful for chronology but must be cross-checked.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
2.1 RS’s own prior referendum initiatives (2011–2024)  
  • Track record: 3 major votes proposed (2011 judiciary referendum; Nov 2015 court-legitimacy referendum; Sept 2016 statehood day referendum).  
  • Outcome: Only the symbolic 2016 Statehood Day vote was actually held; the others were postponed/indefinitely shelved.  
  • Scheduling: Dates were announced 2–6 months in advance, but no date was set for an independence referendum.  

2.2 Sub-national secession referendums globally  
  • Catalonia 2017: unilateral vote announced ≈5 months in advance; annulled by national court.  
  • Scotland 2014: bilateral agreement, announced ≈2 years ahead.  
  • Texas 1861: announced ≈3 months ahead in a full crisis context.  

2.3 Suitability  
  The most relevant reference class is RS’s own history: repeated threats but zero scheduled independence votes in 28 years, despite incremental legal groundwork.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
  • Time to resolution: Today is May 2, 2025; question closes July 1, 2025 → ≈60 days.  
  • Historical RS pattern: When RS has scheduled a vote, announcements came 2–6 months before the vote. By 2 months out they already had a firm date.  
  • Current status: As of early May 2025 no date publicly set.  

4. Justification for outside-view prediction  
  • Base-rate: Within RS’s 28-year post-Dayton history, formal independence referendums have never been scheduled → base rate ~0/1 (0%). Even strong-separatist pushes (2015–17, 2024 law) yielded zero scheduled date.  
  • Adjustment for 2024 context: A new referendum law and a draft “peaceful disassociation” text increase structural readiness. But no date set by May 2025 suggests continued tactical delays to avoid international backlash.  
  • Time pressure: Two months is at the low end of RS’s typical pre-vote lead times; RS leadership has repeatedly preferred indefinite postponement when pressed.  
  • External constraints: EU/US still oppose; Bosnia’s Constitutional Court blocked prior moves; international community likely to threaten sanctions.  
  • Political calculus: Dodik alternates hot rhetoric with tactical retreats. A scheduling announcement now would trigger immediate pushback and possible EU/US reprisals just as Bosnia’s EU application is pending.  

Outside view calibration:  
  • Pure base-rate from RS history: 0% → strong anchor against scheduling.  
  • Factoring in renewed legal framework (2024 law) and escalating separatist rhetoric: upward adjustment to reflect non-zero chance, but constrained by time window and past behavior.  
  • Small differences matter at low end; moving from 0% to ~20% acknowledges the new push without overstating odds.  

Outside View Prediction:  
20% chance that RS will officially announce a date for an independence referendum before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Nationalia, 5 Feb 2025.  Long, magazine-style piece.  Factual core: RS continues to celebrate 9 January despite Bosnia’s court ban; Dodik’s profile, allies (Russia, Hungary), and rhetorical commitment to secession.  Opinion: author’s characterisation of Dodik as “ultra-nationalist,” description of Russia’s strategy as “opportunistic destabilisation.”  Quality: mid-tier journalism, generally reliable for basic facts, cautious weight on opinions.  
2. Wikipedia “Proposed secession of Republika Srpska” (April 2019 snapshot).  Aggregated secondary material; good chronology up to 2019 but dated.  Many statements properly sourced; still, open-edit platform⇒moderate reliability and needs cross-checking for post-2019 events.  
3. Biztonságpolitika.hu, 20 Feb 2021.  Specialist Hungarian security blog.  Supplies detailed timeline of aborted referendums 1996-2020, quotation of constitutional-court decisions, diplomatic interventions.  Mostly factual, some analytic opinion (“significant pushback continues”).  Reliability: moderate.  
4. Reuters/Newsweek, 22 Sep 2016.  International wire service; high factual reliability on 2016 holiday referendum; clearly separates facts from quoted opinions.  
5. RFE/RL pieces (23 & 25 Sep 2016).  Public-service broadcaster funded by US Congress; factual reporting on 2016 referendum turnout and reactions; some colour commentary.  Reliability: high on hard facts; moderate on analytical phrasing.  
6. Perplexity report (2024 compilation).  Synthetic secondary source drawing on UN reports, media, academic blogs.  Provides consolidated timeline (2011-2024) and notes April 2024 RS “Law on Referendum and Citizens’ Initiative” + May 2024 draft “peaceful disassociation” agreement.  Because it is an LLM aggregation, every fact needs external corroboration; treat as clue not proof.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Potential classes  
1. “RS in any given calendar year”: 0 out of ≈30 years (1995-2024) have produced an officially scheduled independence referendum ⇒ empirical base rate ≈0 / 30 ≈ 0%.  
2. “Self-declared proto-states/entities worldwide that talk about but never carry through (e.g., Catalonia 2010-2017, Iraqi Kurdistan pre-2017, Quebec post-1995)”: counting 10–12 entities over last 30 years, roughly 3 have actually scheduled a vote ⇒ ≈25% lifetime probability, but per two-month window much lower.  
3. “RS in short 2-month windows after past high-rhetoric moments” (e.g., 2008 Kosovo, 2015-16 judicial crisis, 2021 land dispute): still 0/≈15 such windows.  
Most suitable: class 1, because the political-institutional environment and actors are nearly unchanged for decades and no independence date has ever been fixed.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → 1 Jul 2025 = 60 days.  RS leadership typically gives several months lead-time when it really wants a popular vote (2016 holiday referendum announced 3 ½ months earlier; planned 2011 and 2015 judicial referendums were announced 4–5 months ahead).  No date exists as of 2 May 2025, therefore they would have to compress planning to < 2 months—unprecedented in RS practice and logistically difficult (assemble entity assembly, adopt act, publish in Official Gazette, start campaign, set up local commissions).  

(d) Justification (outside view)  
• Zero empirical instances in 30 years of Dayton Bosnia where RS actually fixed a date for an independence referendum despite dozens of threats.  
• Two-month window is far shorter than historical RS lead-times.  
• Dodik’s 2024 legislative moves lowered procedural hurdles, but by Feb 2025 (Nationalia article) and early May no follow-through.  That suggests either international deterrence is still working or Dodik prefers the threat over execution.  
• Serbia’s leadership has repeatedly signalled it will not support destabilising steps; loss of Belgrade backing historically coincides with RS shelving plans.  
• Western deterrence mechanisms (EU financial leverage, US sanctions) remain; no major new external protector has offered recognition guarantees.  
• Nothing in sources indicates a scheduled entity assembly session devoted to independence before July.  
Aggregate of reference class data and these constraints points to a very small but non-zero chance (Dodik is idiosyncratic and could call a snap referendum for domestic distraction).  I translate “very small” as low-single-digit percentage.  

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: 0 / 30-year base rate ⇒ 1–2 %.  
Adjust upward for: new 2024 referendum law (+1 pt); increasing nationalist rhetoric amid 30th Dayton anniversary year (+0.5 pt).  
Adjust downward for: extremely short logistical window (-0.5 pt); consistent international pushback (-0.5 pt).  
Net ≈ 1.5–2.5 %.  Round to nearest 0.5 % for clarity → 2 %.  

Outside View Prediction:

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

**Historical Context Sources:**
1. **Nationalia (Feb 2025)** - Recent reporting on RS's holiday referendum with 99.8% "Yes" vote. Includes expert analysis linking referendums to Dodik's political strategies. Highly relevant and current.

2. **New Eastern Europe (Oct 2016)** - Details Dodik's referendum history since 2011, including postponed independence referendum in 2015. Historical but establishes important pattern of behavior.

3. **POLITICO (Sept 2016)** - Notes Dodik has threatened independence referendums since 2006, including unfulfilled 2018 plans. Shows pattern of threats without follow-through.

4. **Al Jazeera (Feb 2020)** - Documents Dodik's "RS-exit" statements and 60-day ultimatum in 2020. Includes High Representative Inzko's statement that such a referendum would lack legal validity.

**Recent News Articles:**
5. **RT (April 30, 2025)** - Contains recent Dodik quote: "I will not be afraid of any sanctions from the EU," showing continued defiance but no referendum mention.

6. **Euronews (April 30, 2025)** - Croatian PM expressing concern about "secessionist rhetoric and actions from Republika Srpska." Shows continued international opposition.

7. **Sarajevo Times (Jan 7, 2025)** - MOST CRITICAL SOURCE - Directly quotes Dodik stating "our political goal is the independence of RS" and "if America is neutral we know what we will decide," explicitly tying plans to Trump presidency.

8. **Izvestia (Jan 9, 2025)** - Includes expert Milan Lazovich's assessment that "RS's exit from Bosnia remains unlikely in the near future" as it would violate Dayton Accords.

9. **RFERL (Jan 9, 2025)** - Reports RS's continued defiance of Constitutional Court by celebrating banned independence day. Shows willingness to defy central authority.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- Historical pattern spanning 15+ years: Dodik has repeatedly threatened independence referendums without scheduling them (from POLITICO, New Eastern Europe sources)
- Structural constraints: Dayton Agreement legally prevents RS secession (High Representative Inzko, Al Jazeera 2020)
- Continued international opposition: Recent Croatian PM statements (April 30, 2025) show persistent concerns about RS separatism

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Explicit independence goal: January 2025 Dodik statement directly identifying independence as "political goal" tied to Trump presidency (Sarajevo Times)
- Proven defiance: RS has previously held referendums despite Constitutional Court rulings (RFERL, January 2025)
- Expert assessment: Recent (January 2025) opinion that RS secession "remains unlikely in the near future" (Izvestia)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Antagonistic stance: Dodik's continued defiance of Western institutions (RT, April 2025)
- Absence of preparation news: No recent reports of referendum committees, question drafting, or budget allocation

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is very short - less than 2 months from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025.

Historical precedent suggests longer timelines:
- 2016 National Day referendum: ~10 months from announcement to implementation
- 2020 threat included a 60-day deadline before even considering a referendum

If the timeframe were doubled (4 months), probability would increase significantly as it would allow time for necessary procedural steps. If halved (1 month), probability would decrease dramatically as insufficient time would remain for even minimal preparations.

## (d) Justification:

Factors against a referendum date announcement:
1. **Established behavioral pattern**: Over 15+ years, Dodik has repeatedly threatened independence referendums without following through, including specific unfulfilled promises (e.g., 2018 referendum mentioned in 2016).

2. **Compressed timeframe**: Less than 2 months remains before July 1 deadline. Historically, even simpler referendums required longer preparation periods.

3. **International constraints**: Recent statements from Croatian PM (April 30, 2025) indicate continued Western opposition, which has historically deterred Dodik from concrete steps.

4. **Absence of preparations**: No reports through April 30, 2025 of necessary prerequisite steps (committee formation, question drafting, budget allocation).

Factors supporting a referendum date announcement:
1. **Explicit goal statement**: Dodik's January 2025 declaration that "independence and autonomy of RS is the political goal" represents one of his clearest statements of intent.

2. **Trump presidency context**: Dodik specifically tied independence plans to expectations of U.S. neutrality under Trump, a condition now present for several months.

3. **Proven defiance capability**: RS has demonstrated willingness to hold referendums despite Constitutional Court rulings (2016 National Day referendum, continued banned celebrations).

The balance of evidence favors "No," but Dodik's explicit January statements tied to Trump's presidency and RS's established pattern of defiance create a non-negligible probability of "Yes."

## Probability calibration

Starting with historical base rate of ~10% (given Dodik's pattern of unfulfilled referendum threats over 15+ years), I adjust:

+10% for Dodik's explicit January 2025 statement identifying independence as "political goal"
+5% for the Trump context he specifically mentioned having materialized
+5% for RS's demonstrated pattern of defying Constitutional Court with previous referendums
-8% for the compressed timeframe and absence of reported preparatory steps

This yields approximately 22% probability.

Consistency check: "22 out of 100 identical situations, RS would announce an independence referendum date before July 1, 2025." This seems reasonable given the evidence.

## Checklist:
1. Will RS officially announce a date for an independence referendum from Bosnia before July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate ~10% from historical unfulfilled referendum threats pattern
3. 22/100 similar situations would see RS announce referendum date - aligns with evidence
4. Key evidence: 15-year pattern of threats without action; explicit January goal statement tied to Trump; no reported preparations; compressed timeframe
5. Blind spot: Undisclosed preparations could be underway or Dodik could make surprise announcement without extensive preparation
6. Status quo favors no announcement within compressed timeframe

Probability: 22%
Predicted Probability: 22.0%

   - Factual: Dodik stated "independence is our political goal" (January 7, 2025)
   - Factual: Dodik plans to attend Moscow Victory Day parade despite EU warnings (April 30, 2025)
   - Quality: High; very recent and directly relevant

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Historical pattern: Dodik has threatened independence referendums multiple times (2011, 2015, 2020) but never scheduled one [supports "No"]
- Institutional: The Dayton Agreement and Constitutional Court remain significant legal barriers [supports "No"]
- Multiple sources confirm Dodik's January 2025 statement that "independence is our political goal" [supports potential "Yes"]

**Moderate evidence:**
- Croatian PM's April 2025 statements expressing specific concern about separatist actions [supports "Yes"]
- Dodik's defiant stance toward EU regarding Moscow visit shows willingness to challenge Western pressure [supports "Yes"]
- Dodik's statement that if "America is neutral we know what we will decide" suggests conditional action [mixed]

**Weak evidence:**
- Limited timeframe (~60 days) to organize referendum announcement [supports "No"]
- Potential connection between Dodik's Moscow visit and referendum announcement [speculative]
- Trump's presidency potentially creating perception of reduced US opposition [speculative]

## Timeframe Analysis

With only 60 days remaining (May 2 - July 1, 2025), there is limited time for the political and administrative processes needed to officially announce a referendum date. If the timeframe were halved (30 days), the probability would decrease significantly due to practical constraints. If doubled (120 days), the probability would increase moderately, allowing more time for political maneuvering and preparation.

## Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 8%, I must adjust based on current evidence:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. Dodik's explicit January 2025 statement that independence is their "political goal"
2. Croatian PM's April 2025 concerns about concrete separatist actions
3. Dodik's increased defiance toward Western pressure (Moscow parade attendance)
4. Trump's presidency potentially creating perceived international openings

**Factors maintaining/decreasing probability:**
1. Dodik's consistent pattern of threatening but never scheduling independence referendums
2. Significant Dayton Agreement and Constitutional Court barriers remain
3. Limited timeframe (60 days) for such a major political announcement
4. No specific mention in recent news of concrete referendum preparations
5. International sanctions risk remains despite changing political landscape

The historical pattern of unfulfilled referendum threats and institutional barriers strongly suggest adhering close to the base rate, while recent statements and evolving international context warrant a moderate upward adjustment.

## Probability calibration

The outside view base rate of 8% should be adjusted upward based on recent developments, particularly Dodik's January 2025 explicit independence statement and his increasing defiance of Western pressure. However, the compelling historical pattern of unfulfilled referendum threats and the short timeframe remain significant constraining factors.

I assess the probability at 15% - a moderate increase from the 8% base rate that acknowledges recent developments while still recognizing the strong historical pattern of threats without follow-through.

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will RS government officially announce an independence referendum date before July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 8% based on RS's unfulfilled referendum history and institutional constraints
3. Consistency: 15/100 times, RS announces independence referendum date before July 1, 2025
4. Key evidence: Dodik's January statement on independence goals; historical pattern of unfulfilled referendum threats; Croatian PM's recent concerns; limited 60-day timeframe
5. Blind spot: Undisclosed agreement with Serbia/Russia providing support could lead to surprise announcement
6. Status quo: RS typically threatens but doesn't schedule referendums; short timeframe reinforces this outcome

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will Republika Srpska’s government officially announce—by July 1, 2025—a date for a referendum on RS independence? Outcome resolves Yes if an authority in RS schedules a date; otherwise No.

2. Source analysis  
• Nationalia (Feb 2025): Reliable regional outlet on RS holiday referendum; confirms Dodik’s pattern of referendums as political tools, no independence date announced.  
• New Eastern Europe/Politico/RFE RL (2016): Detailed, credible accounts of RS referenda history; show referendums repeatedly threatened and delayed under international pressure.  
• Ifimes (2016), AL Jazeera (2020): Reliable background on Dodik’s secession rhetoric and legal moves; highlight persistent international opposition.  
• Perplexity report (May 2024): Aggregates April 2024 RS referendum law and May 2024 “peaceful disassociation” draft; credible but AI‐generated—treat legislative facts as moderate evidence.  
• Asknews Russia/Euronews (2025): Various political and regional news; most are unrelated except RT report of Dodik’s pro-Moscow stance, indicating nationalist signaling but no scheduling.  

3. Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong evidence:  
– Historical pattern: 5+ independence-referendum threats since 1996; none led to a scheduled date (Strong).  
– International pressure: US, EU, Bosnia authorities have repeatedly blocked RS referendum planning (Strong).  
Moderate evidence:  
– April 2024 referendum law and May 2024 disassociation agreement draft indicate preparation for referendum at some point (Moderate).  
– RS leadership rhetoric (Dodik’s public statements in Jan 2025) reaffirms independence goal but gives no timeline (Moderate).  
Weak evidence:  
– RS election dynamics (May 2025 presidency vote): may distract attention but no direct link to scheduling (Weak).  
– External events (Croatia law, Serbia–EU tensions): little bearing on RS referendum scheduling (Weak).

4. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window ≈60 days (May 2–July 1). Historical precedents typically required 6–12 months from announcement to vote. A scheduling announcement within two months is unusually compressed.  
If timeframe halved (30 days), probability would fall to ~5%; if doubled (120 days), rise modestly toward base ~12–15%.

5. Justification  
Base rate: In 30 years RS has threatened secession referendums ~6 times but never scheduled one. That implies a historical base rate of ~10–15%.  
Adjustment factors:  
– No actual scheduling steps by May 2025 despite draft laws in 2024 (downward).  
– Continued strong international opposition and likely sanctions risk (downward).  
– Persistent Dodik rhetoric but no immediate triggering event (neutral).  
– Short window post-election decreases administrative feasibility (downward).  
Net inside-view: shift base 10–15% → 8% probability.

Probability calibration  
I estimate there is an 8% chance that RS will officially announce a referendum date by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: ✔️  
2. Base rate: 10–15% threats without follow-through; inside-view ~8% ✔️  
3. Consistency: “In 8 out of 100 worlds, RS schedules a referendum date by July 1, 2025”—reflects rare, rapid scheduling. ✔️  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Historical non-follow-through (Strong)  
   b) International pressure (Strong)  
   c) 2024 law but no action (Moderate)  
   d) Compressed timeframe (Moderate) ✔️  
5. Blind spot: A sudden collapse in Bosnia’s central institutions could trigger emergency scheduling; remain vigilant but unlikely within 60 days.  
6. Status quo: RS continues rhetorical secessionism without formal scheduling—high inertia.

Probability: 8%
Predicted Probability: 8.0%

Output:
Analysis:

1. Question restated  
Will the Republika Srpska government officially announce, by July 1 2025, a date for an independence referendum (i.e., a public announcement from an RS authority scheduling such a vote)?

2. Outside view base‐rate  
Since Dayton (1995), RS leaders have repeatedly threatened secession votes (2011, 2015, 2016, 2024 draft law) but have never officially set a date for an independence referendum → raw base-rate ≈ 0%.

3. Source analysis  
• Nationalia (Feb 2025) on RS holiday referendum: Medium reliability. Factual on holiday vote but no mention of scheduling an independence vote.  
• New Eastern Europe (2016), Newsweek/Reuters (2016), RFE/RL (2016): High reliability. Document RS pattern of symbolic referenda on National Day, never on independence.  
• Al Jazeera (2020): High reliability. Confirms Dodik’s repeated public secession deadlines but no date ever fixed.  
• Perplexity “2024 draft referendum law”: Low–medium reliability. Suggests legal groundwork for “peaceful disassociation” but no date yet.  
• Asknews articles (Apr–May 2025): None report any RS legislation, commission action, or PPK (People’s Power for Change) statements scheduling an independence referendum.

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence (large downward shift)  
– Historical pattern: Four prior referendum threats, zero scheduling → very strong indication against near-term scheduling.  
Moderate evidence (small upward shift)  
– 2024 draft referendum law & renewed secession rhetoric by Dodik/Cvijanović signal high intent; structural groundwork exists.  
– Two-month window roughly matches lower bound of RS’s prior pre-vote lead (2–6 months), so theoretically feasible.  
Weak evidence  
– Current EU/US warnings and Bosnia Constitutional Court rulings raise immediate political cost, suggesting tactical delay.  
– No leaks or preliminary committee meetings reported in late April/early May 2025 → anecdotal versus systemic.

5. Timeframe considerations  
• Resolution closes in ~60 days. RS typically announces dates ≥ 2 months before a planned referendum.  
• If timeframe halved (30 days left) → probability would drop toward zero (too little lead time). If doubled (120 days) → somewhat higher (but still low given past behavior).

6. Inside-view adjustments  
Start at 0% (never done before).  
+10% for new 2024 draft law and heightened secession rhetoric (structural readiness).  
–5% for zero public scheduling movement by early May, strong past pattern of postponement under pressure.  
–5% for international/legal pushback risk at this juncture.  
→ Adjusted probability ≈ 10%.

7. Final inside-view forecast  
Given the strong historical inertia against formally scheduling an independence vote, the lack of any visible preparatory steps by May 2025, and significant external/legal obstacles, I assess the likelihood at roughly 10%.

Probability calibration  
I predict that about 10 out of 100 similar situations would yield an official referendum date announcement by July 1 2025. This reflects the near-zero history but acknowledges the new legal groundwork and rhetoric.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase (<30 words): See point 1 above.  
2. Base‐rate: 0% historically.  
3. Consistency: “10/100 times, RS officially schedules an independence referendum.”  
4. Top evidence (<20 words each):  
   – Zero past scheduling across four referendum threats.  
   – 2024 draft law creates legal pathway.  
   – Two months lead time typical lower bound.  
   – No public preparatory signals by May 2025.  
   – High international/legal cost deters announcement.  
5. Blind-spot: A clandestine last-minute decree in late June could slip under radar, raising odds slightly.  
6. Status quo bias: RS tends to threaten secession but avoid formal steps, favoring 10% tilt to “No.”

Predicted Probability: 10.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first – only those that bear on the referendum issue)
• RT (30 Apr 2025, Russian-language).  Direct quote of Milorad Dodik reacting to EU pressure over Serbia/Moscow visit.  Factual element: Dodik will travel to Moscow despite EU objections.  Opinion: RT frames EU as “bandit methods.”  Quality: partisan (Kremlin-funded) but quotations of Dodik are usually accurate.  Relevance: shows continued defiance of the West, but no concrete referendum step.  Weight: weak-to-moderate.
• Euronews/DE/ES/TR articles (30 Apr 2025).  Quotes Croatian PM Plenković warning about “secessionist rhetoric from RS.”  Quality: mainstream European broadcaster, high factual reliability.  Relevance: signals ongoing EU concern but again no hard scheduling.  Weight: weak.
• Nationalia (5 Feb 2025).  Long feature on January-9 holiday referendum.  Provides hard facts on a recent (symbolic) referendum organised in three months, demonstrating RS can move fast if it wants.  Quality: niche but professional; facts match other outlets.  Weight: moderate (procedural precedent).
• Sarajevo Times (7 Jan 2025).  Quotes Dodik: “Our political goal is independence… if America is neutral we know what we will decide.”  Quality: Bosnian outlet, generally factual.  Shows ambition, not action.  Weight: weak-to-moderate.
• RFE/RL (9 Jan 2025).  Reports annual parade held despite court bans; US Embassy warning.  High factual reliability.  Illustrates continuing legal defiance yet absence of referendum scheduling.  Weight: weak.
• Al-Jazeera (18 Feb 2020) + historical pieces (2016–2021).  Document repeated threats going back 15 years, none realised.  High factual reliability.  Weight: strong (historical pattern).

No AskNews dispatch between February and 2 May 2025 contains even a draft bill, parliamentary agenda item or government communiqué setting a DATE for an independence referendum.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence
• 0/30-year history of actually fixing a referendum date on independence despite dozens of threats (structural, multi-source).  ↓ probability sharply.
Moderate evidence
• New 2024 “Law on Referendum & Citizens’ Initiative” removed some procedural hurdles (single source but plausible).  ↑ a little.
• Holiday referendum (September 2016; January-9 referendum repeated 2025) shows entity can call a vote inside ≈90 days if leadership decides (multiple sources).  ↑ slightly.
• Two-month remaining window is unprecedentedly short for RS to finish legislative passage AND publish in Official Gazette, but only the date must be announced – execution can be later.  Neutral to slight ↑.
Weak evidence
• Dodik’s latest rhetoric + Moscow visit (April 2025) shows confrontational mood but is consistent with long-standing pattern of bluffing.  Minor ↑.  
• International pressure (EU, US sanctions) continues with no new escalatory measures.  Slight ↓ (maintains deterrent).

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time left: 60 days (2 May → 1 Jul 2025).
If the window were doubled (120 days) I would raise the probability to ~7 %.  If halved (30 days) I would cut to ~1.5 %.  Hence timing is a meaningful but not dominant driver.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view anchor: 2 % (0/30-year base rate).
Adjustments
+1 pt  New referendum law lowering hurdles.
+0.5 pt  Demonstrated ability to schedule other referenda quickly.
–0.5 pt  Only 60 days left; needs Assembly majority, Official Gazette publication.
–0.5 pt  Unchanged pattern of threats-without-follow-through; Serbia & EU still signal opposition.
Net: ~2.5 %.

I round to a clean 3 % to account for asymmetric risk of a “bolt-from-the-blue” political stunt (e.g., Dodik convenes emergency session and proclaims a September 2025 referendum).

Probability calibration
I expect that in 3 out of 100 similar 60-day periods, Republika Srpska leadership would formally set a date for an independence referendum before the deadline.  97 times they would not.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will RS announce a date for an independence referendum before 1 July 2025?” ✔
2. Outside view 2 % → inside view 3 %, rooted in same reference class. ✔
3. Consistency line – “3 out of 100 times, a date gets scheduled.” ✔
4. Key evidence: (i) 30-year zero-event record; (ii) new 2024 referendum law; (iii) holiday referendum shows fast logistics; (iv) only 60 days left; (v) continuing EU/US deterrence. ✔
5. Blind-spot: sudden internal crisis (property law clash) prompts Assembly to set a symbolic date (e.g., 9 Jan 2026) within a single sitting. Would raise odds to ~15 %. ✔
6. Status-quo pull favours “No”. My estimate already leans heavily that way. ✔

Probability: 3%
Predicted Probability: 3.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

**Historical Context Sources:**
1. **Nationalia (Feb 2025)** - Recent reporting on RS's holiday referendum with 99.8% "Yes" vote. Includes expert analysis linking referendums to Dodik's political strategies. Highly relevant and current.

2. **New Eastern Europe (Oct 2016)** - Details Dodik's referendum history since 2011, including postponed independence referendum in 2015. Historical but establishes important pattern of behavior.

3. **POLITICO (Sept 2016)** - Notes Dodik has threatened independence referendums since 2006, including unfulfilled 2018 plans. Shows pattern of threats without follow-through.

4. **Al Jazeera (Feb 2020)** - Documents Dodik's "RS-exit" statements and 60-day ultimatum in 2020. Includes High Representative Inzko's statement that such a referendum would lack legal validity.

**Recent News Articles:**
5. **RT (April 30, 2025)** - Contains recent Dodik quote: "I will not be afraid of any sanctions from the EU," showing continued defiance but no referendum mention.

6. **Euronews (April 30, 2025)** - Croatian PM expressing concern about "secessionist rhetoric and actions from Republika Srpska." Shows continued international opposition.

7. **Sarajevo Times (Jan 7, 2025)** - MOST CRITICAL SOURCE - Directly quotes Dodik stating "our political goal is the independence of RS" and "if America is neutral we know what we will decide," explicitly tying plans to Trump presidency.

8. **Izvestia (Jan 9, 2025)** - Includes expert Milan Lazovich's assessment that "RS's exit from Bosnia remains unlikely in the near future" as it would violate Dayton Accords.

9. **RFERL (Jan 9, 2025)** - Reports RS's continued defiance of Constitutional Court by celebrating banned independence day. Shows willingness to defy central authority.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- Historical pattern spanning 15+ years: Dodik has repeatedly threatened independence referendums without scheduling them (from POLITICO, New Eastern Europe sources)
- Structural constraints: Dayton Agreement legally prevents RS secession (High Representative Inzko, Al Jazeera 2020)
- Continued international opposition: Recent Croatian PM statements (April 30, 2025) show persistent concerns about RS separatism

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Explicit independence goal: January 2025 Dodik statement directly identifying independence as "political goal" tied to Trump presidency (Sarajevo Times)
- Proven defiance: RS has previously held referendums despite Constitutional Court rulings (RFERL, January 2025)
- Expert assessment: Recent (January 2025) opinion that RS secession "remains unlikely in the near future" (Izvestia)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Antagonistic stance: Dodik's continued defiance of Western institutions (RT, April 2025)
- Absence of preparation news: No recent reports of referendum committees, question drafting, or budget allocation

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is very short - less than 2 months from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025.

Historical precedent suggests longer timelines:
- 2016 National Day referendum: ~10 months from announcement to implementation
- 2020 threat included a 60-day deadline before even considering a referendum

If the timeframe were doubled (4 months), probability would increase significantly as it would allow time for necessary procedural steps. If halved (1 month), probability would decrease dramatically as insufficient time would remain for even minimal preparations.

## (d) Justification:

Factors against a referendum date announcement:
1. **Established behavioral pattern**: Over 15+ years, Dodik has repeatedly threatened independence referendums without following through, including specific unfulfilled promises (e.g., 2018 referendum mentioned in 2016).

2. **Compressed timeframe**: Less than 2 months remains before July 1 deadline. Historically, even simpler referendums required longer preparation periods.

3. **International constraints**: Recent statements from Croatian PM (April 30, 2025) indicate continued Western opposition, which has historically deterred Dodik from concrete steps.

4. **Absence of preparations**: No reports through April 30, 2025 of necessary prerequisite steps (committee formation, question drafting, budget allocation).

Factors supporting a referendum date announcement:
1. **Explicit goal statement**: Dodik's January 2025 declaration that "independence and autonomy of RS is the political goal" represents one of his clearest statements of intent.

2. **Trump presidency context**: Dodik specifically tied independence plans to expectations of U.S. neutrality under Trump, a condition now present for several months.

3. **Proven defiance capability**: RS has demonstrated willingness to hold referendums despite Constitutional Court rulings (2016 National Day referendum, continued banned celebrations).

The balance of evidence favors "No," but Dodik's explicit January statements tied to Trump's presidency and RS's established pattern of defiance create a non-negligible probability of "Yes."

## Probability calibration

Starting with historical base rate of ~10% (given Dodik's pattern of unfulfilled referendum threats over 15+ years), I adjust:

+10% for Dodik's explicit January 2025 statement identifying independence as "political goal"
+5% for the Trump context he specifically mentioned having materialized
+5% for RS's demonstrated pattern of defying Constitutional Court with previous referendums
-8% for the compressed timeframe and absence of reported preparatory steps

This yields approximately 22% probability.

Consistency check: "22 out of 100 identical situations, RS would announce an independence referendum date before July 1, 2025." This seems reasonable given the evidence.

## Checklist:
1. Will RS officially announce a date for an independence referendum from Bosnia before July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate ~10% from historical unfulfilled referendum threats pattern
3. 22/100 similar situations would see RS announce referendum date - aligns with evidence
4. Key evidence: 15-year pattern of threats without action; explicit January goal statement tied to Trump; no reported preparations; compressed timeframe
5. Blind spot: Undisclosed preparations could be underway or Dodik could make surprise announcement without extensive preparation
6. Status quo favors no announcement within compressed timeframe

Probability: 22%
Predicted Probability: 22.0%

   - Factual: Dodik plans to attend Moscow Victory Day parade despite EU warnings (April 30, 2025)
   - Quality: High; very recent and directly relevant

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Historical pattern: Dodik has threatened independence referendums multiple times (2011, 2015, 2020) but never scheduled one [supports "No"]
- Institutional: The Dayton Agreement and Constitutional Court remain significant legal barriers [supports "No"]
- Multiple sources confirm Dodik's January 2025 statement that "independence is our political goal" [supports potential "Yes"]

**Moderate evidence:**
- Croatian PM's April 2025 statements expressing specific concern about separatist actions [supports "Yes"]
- Dodik's defiant stance toward EU regarding Moscow visit shows willingness to challenge Western pressure [supports "Yes"]
- Dodik's statement that if "America is neutral we know what we will decide" suggests conditional action [mixed]

**Weak evidence:**
- Limited timeframe (~60 days) to organize referendum announcement [supports "No"]
- Potential connection between Dodik's Moscow visit and referendum announcement [speculative]
- Trump's presidency potentially creating perception of reduced US opposition [speculative]

## Timeframe Analysis

With only 60 days remaining (May 2 - July 1, 2025), there is limited time for the political and administrative processes needed to officially announce a referendum date. If the timeframe were halved (30 days), the probability would decrease significantly due to practical constraints. If doubled (120 days), the probability would increase moderately, allowing more time for political maneuvering and preparation.

## Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 8%, I must adjust based on current evidence:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. Dodik's explicit January 2025 statement that independence is their "political goal"
2. Croatian PM's April 2025 concerns about concrete separatist actions
3. Dodik's increased defiance toward Western pressure (Moscow parade attendance)
4. Trump's presidency potentially creating perceived international openings

**Factors maintaining/decreasing probability:**
1. Dodik's consistent pattern of threatening but never scheduling independence referendums
2. Significant Dayton Agreement and Constitutional Court barriers remain
3. Limited timeframe (60 days) for such a major political announcement
4. No specific mention in recent news of concrete referendum preparations
5. International sanctions risk remains despite changing political landscape

The historical pattern of unfulfilled referendum threats and institutional barriers strongly suggest adhering close to the base rate, while recent statements and evolving international context warrant a moderate upward adjustment.

## Probability calibration

The outside view base rate of 8% should be adjusted upward based on recent developments, particularly Dodik's January 2025 explicit independence statement and his increasing defiance of Western pressure. However, the compelling historical pattern of unfulfilled referendum threats and the short timeframe remain significant constraining factors.

I assess the probability at 15% - a moderate increase from the 8% base rate that acknowledges recent developments while still recognizing the strong historical pattern of threats without follow-through.

1. Paraphrase: Will RS government officially announce an independence referendum date before July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 8% based on RS's unfulfilled referendum history and institutional constraints
3. Consistency: 15/100 times, RS announces independence referendum date before July 1, 2025

• Ifimes (2016), AL Jazeera (2020): Reliable background on Dodik’s secession rhetoric and legal moves; highlight persistent international opposition.  
• Perplexity report (May 2024): Aggregates April 2024 RS referendum law and May 2024 “peaceful disassociation” draft; credible but AI‐generated—treat legislative facts as moderate evidence.  
• Asknews Russia/Euronews (2025): Various political and regional news; most are unrelated except RT report of Dodik’s pro-Moscow stance, indicating nationalist signaling but no scheduling.  

3. Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong evidence:  
– Historical pattern: 5+ independence-referendum threats since 1996; none led to a scheduled date (Strong).  
– International pressure: US, EU, Bosnia authorities have repeatedly blocked RS referendum planning (Strong).  
Moderate evidence:  
– April 2024 referendum law and May 2024 disassociation agreement draft indicate preparation for referendum at some point (Moderate).  
– RS leadership rhetoric (Dodik’s public statements in Jan 2025) reaffirms independence goal but gives no timeline (Moderate).  
Weak evidence:  
– RS election dynamics (May 2025 presidency vote): may distract attention but no direct link to scheduling (Weak).  
– External events (Croatia law, Serbia–EU tensions): little bearing on RS referendum scheduling (Weak).

4. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window ≈60 days (May 2–July 1). Historical precedents typically required 6–12 months from announcement to vote. A scheduling announcement within two months is unusually compressed.  
If timeframe halved (30 days), probability would fall to ~5%; if doubled (120 days), rise modestly toward base ~12–15%.

5. Justification  
Base rate: In 30 years RS has threatened secession referendums ~6 times but never scheduled one. That implies a historical base rate of ~10–15%.  
Adjustment factors:  
– No actual scheduling steps by May 2025 despite draft laws in 2024 (downward).  
– Continued strong international opposition and likely sanctions risk (downward).  
– Persistent Dodik rhetoric but no immediate triggering event (neutral).  
– Short window post-election decreases administrative feasibility (downward).  
Net inside-view: shift base 10–15% → 8% probability.

Probability calibration  
I estimate there is an 8% chance that RS will officially announce a referendum date by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: ✔️  
2. Base rate: 10–15% threats without follow-through; inside-view ~8% ✔️  
3. Consistency: “In 8 out of 100 worlds, RS schedules a referendum date by July 1, 2025”—reflects rare, rapid scheduling. ✔️  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Historical non-follow-through (Strong)  
   b) International pressure (Strong)  
   c) 2024 law but no action (Moderate)  
   d) Compressed timeframe (Moderate) ✔️  
5. Blind spot: A sudden collapse in Bosnia’s central institutions could trigger emergency scheduling; remain vigilant but unlikely within 60 days.  
6. Status quo: RS continues rhetorical secessionism without formal scheduling—high inertia.

Probability: 8%
Predicted Probability: 8.0%

Analysis:

1. Question restated  
Will the Republika Srpska government officially announce, by July 1 2025, a date for an independence referendum (i.e., a public announcement from an RS authority scheduling such a vote)?

2. Outside view base‐rate  
Since Dayton (1995), RS leaders have repeatedly threatened secession votes (2011, 2015, 2016, 2024 draft law) but have never officially set a date for an independence referendum → raw base-rate ≈ 0%.

3. Source analysis  
• Nationalia (Feb 2025) on RS holiday referendum: Medium reliability. Factual on holiday vote but no mention of scheduling an independence vote.  
• New Eastern Europe (2016), Newsweek/Reuters (2016), RFE/RL (2016): High reliability. Document RS pattern of symbolic referenda on National Day, never on independence.  
• Al Jazeera (2020): High reliability. Confirms Dodik’s repeated public secession deadlines but no date ever fixed.  
• Perplexity “2024 draft referendum law”: Low–medium reliability. Suggests legal groundwork for “peaceful disassociation” but no date yet.  
• Asknews articles (Apr–May 2025): None report any RS legislation, commission action, or PPK (People’s Power for Change) statements scheduling an independence referendum.

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence (large downward shift)  
– Historical pattern: Four prior referendum threats, zero scheduling → very strong indication against near-term scheduling.  
Moderate evidence (small upward shift)  
– 2024 draft referendum law & renewed secession rhetoric by Dodik/Cvijanović signal high intent; structural groundwork exists.  
– Two-month window roughly matches lower bound of RS’s prior pre-vote lead (2–6 months), so theoretically feasible.  
Weak evidence  
– Current EU/US warnings and Bosnia Constitutional Court rulings raise immediate political cost, suggesting tactical delay.  
– No leaks or preliminary committee meetings reported in late April/early May 2025 → anecdotal versus systemic.

5. Timeframe considerations  
• Resolution closes in ~60 days. RS typically announces dates ≥ 2 months before a planned referendum.  
• If timeframe halved (30 days left) → probability would drop toward zero (too little lead time). If doubled (120 days) → somewhat higher (but still low given past behavior).

6. Inside-view adjustments  
Start at 0% (never done before).  
+10% for new 2024 draft law and heightened secession rhetoric (structural readiness).  
–5% for zero public scheduling movement by early May, strong past pattern of postponement under pressure.  
–5% for international/legal pushback risk at this juncture.  
→ Adjusted probability ≈ 10%.

7. Final inside-view forecast  
Given the strong historical inertia against formally scheduling an independence vote, the lack of any visible preparatory steps by May 2025, and significant external/legal obstacles, I assess the likelihood at roughly 10%.

Probability calibration  
I predict that about 10 out of 100 similar situations would yield an official referendum date announcement by July 1 2025. This reflects the near-zero history but acknowledges the new legal groundwork and rhetoric.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase (<30 words): See point 1 above.  
2. Base‐rate: 0% historically.  
3. Consistency: “10/100 times, RS officially schedules an independence referendum.”  
4. Top evidence (<20 words each):  
   – Zero past scheduling across four referendum threats.  
   – 2024 draft law creates legal pathway.  
   – Two months lead time typical lower bound.  
   – No public preparatory signals by May 2025.  
   – High international/legal cost deters announcement.  
5. Blind-spot: A clandestine last-minute decree in late June could slip under radar, raising odds slightly.  
6. Status quo bias: RS tends to threaten secession but avoid formal steps, favoring 10% tilt to “No.”

Probability: 10%
Predicted Probability: 10.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first – only those that bear on the referendum issue)
• RT (30 Apr 2025, Russian-language).  Direct quote of Milorad Dodik reacting to EU pressure over Serbia/Moscow visit.  Factual element: Dodik will travel to Moscow despite EU objections.  Opinion: RT frames EU as “bandit methods.”  Quality: partisan (Kremlin-funded) but quotations of Dodik are usually accurate.  Relevance: shows continued defiance of the West, but no concrete referendum step.  Weight: weak-to-moderate.
• Euronews/DE/ES/TR articles (30 Apr 2025).  Quotes Croatian PM Plenković warning about “secessionist rhetoric from RS.”  Quality: mainstream European broadcaster, high factual reliability.  Relevance: signals ongoing EU concern but again no hard scheduling.  Weight: weak.
• Nationalia (5 Feb 2025).  Long feature on January-9 holiday referendum.  Provides hard facts on a recent (symbolic) referendum organised in three months, demonstrating RS can move fast if it wants.  Quality: niche but professional; facts match other outlets.  Weight: moderate (procedural precedent).
• Sarajevo Times (7 Jan 2025).  Quotes Dodik: “Our political goal is independence… if America is neutral we know what we will decide.”  Quality: Bosnian outlet, generally factual.  Shows ambition, not action.  Weight: weak-to-moderate.
• RFE/RL (9 Jan 2025).  Reports annual parade held despite court bans; US Embassy warning.  High factual reliability.  Illustrates continuing legal defiance yet absence of referendum scheduling.  Weight: weak.
• Al-Jazeera (18 Feb 2020) + historical pieces (2016–2021).  Document repeated threats going back 15 years, none realised.  High factual reliability.  Weight: strong (historical pattern).

No AskNews dispatch between February and 2 May 2025 contains even a draft bill, parliamentary agenda item or government communiqué setting a DATE for an independence referendum.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence
• 0/30-year history of actually fixing a referendum date on independence despite dozens of threats (structural, multi-source).  ↓ probability sharply.
Moderate evidence
• New 2024 “Law on Referendum & Citizens’ Initiative” removed some procedural hurdles (single source but plausible).  ↑ a little.
• Holiday referendum (September 2016; January-9 referendum repeated 2025) shows entity can call a vote inside ≈90 days if leadership decides (multiple sources).  ↑ slightly.
• Two-month remaining window is unprecedentedly short for RS to finish legislative passage AND publish in Official Gazette, but only the date must be announced – execution can be later.  Neutral to slight ↑.
Weak evidence
• Dodik’s latest rhetoric + Moscow visit (April 2025) shows confrontational mood but is consistent with long-standing pattern of bluffing.  Minor ↑.  
• International pressure (EU, US sanctions) continues with no new escalatory measures.  Slight ↓ (maintains deterrent).

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time left: 60 days (2 May → 1 Jul 2025).
If the window were doubled (120 days) I would raise the probability to ~7 %.  If halved (30 days) I would cut to ~1.5 %.  Hence timing is a meaningful but not dominant driver.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view anchor: 2 % (0/30-year base rate).
Adjustments
+1 pt  New referendum law lowering hurdles.
+0.5 pt  Demonstrated ability to schedule other referenda quickly.
–0.5 pt  Only 60 days left; needs Assembly majority, Official Gazette publication.
–0.5 pt  Unchanged pattern of threats-without-follow-through; Serbia & EU still signal opposition.
Net: ~2.5 %.

I round to a clean 3 % to account for asymmetric risk of a “bolt-from-the-blue” political stunt (e.g., Dodik convenes emergency session and proclaims a September 2025 referendum).

Probability calibration
I expect that in 3 out of 100 similar 60-day periods, Republika Srpska leadership would formally set a date for an independence referendum before the deadline.  97 times they would not.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will RS announce a date for an independence referendum before 1 July 2025?” ✔
2. Outside view 2 % → inside view 3 %, rooted in same reference class. ✔
3. Consistency line – “3 out of 100 times, a date gets scheduled.” ✔
4. Key evidence: (i) 30-year zero-event record; (ii) new 2024 referendum law; (iii) holiday referendum shows fast logistics; (iv) only 60 days left; (v) continuing EU/US deterrence. ✔
5. Blind-spot: sudden internal crisis (property law clash) prompts Assembly to set a symbolic date (e.g., 9 Jan 2026) within a single sitting. Would raise odds to ~15 %. ✔
6. Status-quo pull favours “No”. My estimate already leans heavily that way. ✔

Probability: 3%
Predicted Probability: 3.0%...
