Analysis:
We need a solid outside‐view on the historical pace and pattern of countries joining the Artemis Accords since launch in 2020. Key data include the dates and frequency of past signings (monthly, quarterly, yearly), any clustering by region or alliance, and typical delays between initial agreement announcements and formal signings. We then want recent news on potential new signatories and statements by holdout states to gauge likelihood of at least one more accession by July 1, 2025.

Analysis:
As of May 16, 2025, the Artemis Accords count 54 signatories—Bangladesh being the most recent on April 8. Historically, new accessions have trickled in roughly one per 1–3 months; with ~45 days until July 1, adding one more is plausible but not guaranteed. To build an inside view, I need:
• Any recent government or space agency statements (e.g., DOS, NASA) indicating active outreach or pending accessions  
• News of non-signatory states expressing formal interest or signing MoUs  
• Expert commentary from space policy forums (IAC, COSPAR) on likely next signatories  
• Market or expert expectations (e.g., space policy analysts’ forecasts)

Search queries:
1. Artemis Accords next signatory country news (Google)  
2. latest Artemis Accords signatories prospects update (Google News)  
3. Please gather recent news and official statements on countries in talks to join the Artemis Accords, including any MoUs or announcements indicating imminent accession. I’m interested in space policy expert analyses and government reports that shed light on whether the Accord will reach 55 signatories by July 1, 2025. [Assistant]

Here’s a concise summary of the January 22, 2023 “Artemis Accords: What are they & which countries are involved?” article by Robert Lea (Science journalist; BSc in physics & astronomy):

1. Purpose and Scope  
 • The Artemis Accords are a set of voluntary, nationally-signed principles, guidelines and best practices for the safe, peaceful, and responsible exploration of the Moon—and eventually Mars, comets, asteroids, Lagrange points, and transit between these bodies.  
 • Led by NASA’s Artemis program (aiming to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon in 2024) and co-sponsored by the U.S. State Department, the Accords seek a “singular global coalition” for space exploration.

2. Legal and Policy Foundations  
 • Reaffirm compliance with:  
   – 1967 Outer Space Treaty  
   – 1968 Rescue and Return Agreement  
   – 1972 Liability Convention  
   – 1975 Registration Convention  
 • Emphasize safety, transparency (e.g., sharing scientific data), interoperability of systems, deconfliction of activities, and preservation of heritage sites.

3. History and Signatories  
 • First signed by eight nations in October 2020.  
 • First in-person meeting of signatory representatives held September 19, 2022 at the International Astronautical Congress in Paris.  
 • Quotation (reliable source): NASA Admin. Jim Bridenstine (2020): “Artemis will be the broadest and most diverse international human space exploration program in history… establishing vital principles… for all humanity to enjoy.”

4. Status (as of article)  
 • “At the time of writing, 55 countries have signed,” including the U.S., U.K., Japan, Italy, Canada, and Brazil.  
 • (The article indicates an alphabetical list “as of May 15, 2025,” but that list was not fully extracted.)

<Summary source="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/signatories-of-the-usled-artemis-accords-meet-in-person-for-the-first-time/9637F1D9B1F81BCF5AA4AC659DA316AE">
Below is a summary of the Cambridge Core article “Signatories of the U.S.–Led Artemis Accords Meet in Person for the First Time” (American Journal of International Law):

1. First in-Person Meeting  
  • On September 19, 2022, representatives of 21 Artemis Accords signatories met at the International Astronautical Congress in Paris— the first in-person gathering since the Accords’ launch on October 13, 2020.  
  • Jennifer Littlejohn (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs) described the meeting as “just the start of the conversation.”

2. Purpose and Scope of the Accords  
  • Drafted by the United States, the Accords set out ten non-binding “political commitments” (beyond restating existing law) to govern civil exploration and use of outer space in support of NASA’s Artemis Program.  
  • Scope covers civil space activities by signatory agencies on the Moon, Mars, comets, asteroids (surfaces/subsurfaces), in lunar/Martian orbit, at Earth–Moon Lagrange points, and in transit.  
  • Accords affirm compliance with four of the five UN space treaties (Outer Space Treaty, Rescue and Return Agreement, Liability Convention, Registration Convention) but omit the Moon Agreement.

3. Ten Principles  
  Signatories agree to principles intended to boost safety, predictability, and sustainability:  
   1) Peaceful purposes  
   2) Transparency  
   3) Interoperability  
   4) Emergency assistance  
   5) Registration of space objects  
   6) Release of scientific data  
   7) Preserving space heritage  
   8) Space resources  
   9) Deconfliction of space activities  
  10) Orbital debris

4. Benefits and U.S. Policy Context  
  • Accords membership grants access to Artemis Program partnerships (aiming to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, and prepare for Mars).  
  • Reflects long-standing U.S. policy:  
    – 2015 SPACE Act (granting U.S. citizens rights to recovered space resources)  
    – April 2020 Trump executive order (rejecting “global commons” notion, urging sustainable resource use)  
    – Trump National Space Policy (deep-space economic activity, lunar presence, infrastructure for Mars)  
    – Biden Space Priorities Framework (reaffirming these goals)

5. Innovations and Legal Debates  
  • Substantive innovation: the Accords assert that commercial extraction of space resources “does not inherently constitute national appropriation” under Article II of the Outer Space Treaty.  
  • Procedural innovation: they introduce “deconfliction” (coordination to prevent harmful interference) and “safety zones” (defined areas requiring notification/coordination).  
  • Critics (notably China, Russia, some space law scholars) argue the Accords:  
    – Impose a U.S.-friendly reading of international space law, favoring commercial interests  
    – Bypass traditional UN lawmaking via COPUOS

6. Significance  
  Though the Paris meeting yielded no major announcements, the gathering underscored the Accords’ growing role in shaping a parallel, U.S.-led framework for space resource governance outside established multilateral channels.

<Summary source="https://spacenews.com/finland-signs-artemis-accords/">
Here are the key points from Jeff Foust’s “Finland signs Artemis Accords” (SpaceNews, Jan. 22, 2025):

1. Finland’s Accession  
   • On Jan. 21, 2025, Finland became the 53rd signatory to the Artemis Accords— and the first to join in 2025—by signing during the Winter Satellite Workshop at Aalto University in Espoo.  
   • Signing on Finland’s behalf was Wille Rydman, minister of economic affairs.

2. Official Statements  
   • NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free: “Today, Finland is joining a community of nations that want to share scientific data freely, operate safely and preserve the space environment for the Artemis Generation.”  
   • Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs emphasized that the Accords are non-binding, affirmed the UN as the primary forum for space law, and pledged compliance with UN space law.

3. Context and Momentum  
   • In 2024, 19 countries signed the Accords—the highest annual total to date—reflecting “growing appreciation for the value of the Accords as a forum for discussing issues like space safety and sustainability” (officials at NASA and the U.S. State Department).  
   • The Artemis Accords were launched in 2020 under the first Trump administration with eight founding nations.

4. Questions About Continuity Under the New Administration  
   • Jan. 20 executive order by President Trump (to incoming Secretary of State Marco Rubio) calls for an “America First” foreign policy that “champion[s] core American interests and always put[s] America and American citizens first.”  
   • Lori Garver (former NASA deputy administrator, Obama administration) expressed skepticism about the pace and priority of diplomacy under this philosophy, wondering if the administration “will feel like they want to do things that are maybe a little different.”  
   • Scott Pace (executive secretary, National Space Council, first Trump administration) argued that international cooperation on space norms, economic predictability, and security “is going to be an important part of the Trump administration,” albeit perhaps with different emphases or styles.

# Comprehensive Analysis of Artemis Accords Signatories: Timeline, Patterns, and Future Prospects  

The Artemis Accords, established in October 2020 under NASA leadership, have rapidly evolved into a cornerstone of international space governance. As of May 2025, 55 nations have joined this framework, which promotes peaceful, transparent, and sustainable space exploration. This report traces the chronological expansion of signatories, analyzes regional and political dynamics influencing participation, and examines announced commitments through mid-2025.  

---

## Timeline of Signatories (2020–2025)  

### Founding Phase (2020)  
The Artemis Accords launched on **October 13, 2020**, with eight founding members: Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (U.S.)[3]. These nations emphasized adherence to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and principles like interoperability and emergency assistance. Ukraine became the ninth signatory on **November 13, 2020**, signaling early interest from non-Western states[3].  

### Accelerated Adoption (2021–2023)  
In **2021**, membership expanded to 18 countries. South Korea joined on **May 24**, followed by New Zealand (June 1), Brazil (June 15), Poland (October 26), and Mexico (December 9)[3]. This period marked growing engagement from Asia-Pacific and Latin American nations.  

The **2022** surge saw 12 new signatories, including Israel (March 3), Romania (March 11), Bahrain (March 18), Singapore (March 28), Colombia (May 10), France (June 7), Saudi Arabia (July 14), Rwanda (December 13), and Nigeria (December 14)[3]. France’s participation, finalized during President Emmanuel Macron’s discussions with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, underscored transatlantic collaboration[3].  

**2023** additions totaled 11 countries, beginning with the Czech Republic (January 30) and Spain (February 14). Ecuador (March 7) and India (June 21) joined mid-year, with India’s signing during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s U.S. state visit highlighting strategic alignment[4]. Germany (September 22), Iceland (October 12), the Netherlands (October 27), Bulgaria (November 8), and Angola (December 11) rounded out the year[3].  

### Peak Expansion (2024)  
The most rapid growth occurred in **2024**, with **19 nations** joining. European states dominated: Belgium (January 8), Greece (February 14), Sweden (May 3), Slovenia (April 19)[12], Lithuania (May 10), Estonia (October 13)[7], Cyprus (November 8), and Liechtenstein (December 22)[3]. Latin American participation grew via Uruguay (March 4), Peru (June 18), Chile (November 20), and Panama (December 11)[1][5]. Asian representation included Thailand (December 16), the first nation also involved in China’s International Lunar Research Station[3].  

### Continued Momentum (2025)

### Balancing Global Rivalries  
Thailand’s dual membership in the Artemis Accords and China’s lunar project illustrates attempts to balance U.S. and Chinese influence[3]. Similarly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE used signatory status to diversify international alliances beyond hydrocarbon economies[3].  

---

## Announced Commitments Through Mid-2025  
As of May 2025, no additional countries beyond the 55 signatories have publicly announced plans to join. However, NASA and the U.S. State Department anticipate continued expansion, particularly among African and Southeast Asian nations[13]. The February 2025 UNOOSA workshop highlighted ongoing dialogues with non-signatory ESA associate members (e.g., Latvia, Malta)[9][13].  

---

## Conclusion  
The Artemis Accords have transitioned from a U.S.-centric initiative to a global coalition spanning six continents. Membership trends reveal strategic partnerships, technological aspirations, and geopolitical balancing. While no new countries are confirmed for mid-2025, the framework’s emphasis on open data sharing and sustainable exploration ensures its relevance in an increasingly multipolar space era.

<Summary source="https://spacenews.com/artemis-accords-reach-50-signatories-with-panama-and-austria/">
Here’s a concise summary of Jeff Foust’s December 12, 2024 SpaceNews article:

• Panama and Austria signed the Artemis Accords on December 11, 2024, at NASA Headquarters, bringing the total to 50 signatories.  
• The Accords—first signed in 2020 by the United States and seven partners—establish best practices in space exploration (e.g., data sharing, resource utilization).  
• NASA Administrator Bill Nelson celebrated reaching “almost a quarter of all the nations of the world,” likening Accords growth to a relay race: Trump-era negotiators secured the first eight signatories, the current administration added 42, and “we will hand the baton off” to the next administration.  
• Jennifer Littlejohn (Acting Assistant Secretary, State Dept. Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs) highlighted the Accords’ role at the center of U.S. civil space diplomacy and noted they span from major spacefaring powers to emerging participants.  
• Austria—an EU and ESA member hosting the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs—views the Accords as complementary to UN COPUOS work (Ambassador Petra Schneebauer).  
• Panama, which joined UN COPUOS in 2021, sees its signature as “a bold commitment to peaceful exploration, scientific discovery and international collaboration” (Ambassador José Miguel Alemán Healy).  
• Mike Gold (Redwire chief growth officer, former NASA official) said 50 signatories set a precedent that can influence even “irresponsible” space actors. He and Nelson both anticipate reaching 52 signatories soon, at which point a majority of COPUOS members will be on board.  
• State Dept. Office of Space Affairs Director Valda Vikmanis noted 17 countries joined the Accords in 2024 (one-third of all signatories) and expects the pace to continue through the upcoming U.S. administration transition.

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Space.com article (January 22, 2023)** - This article provides background on the Artemis Accords but contains a puzzling temporal inconsistency, claiming "55 countries have signed" while referencing "May 15, 2025" - a future date relative to the article's publication. This inconsistency undermines the reliability of this specific claim, though the general background information seems credible.

2. **Space.com article (December 12, 2024)** - Reports Panama and Austria becoming the 49th and 50th signatories on December 11, 2024. Contains factual reporting with direct quotes from NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Austria's ambassador. High credibility from a reputable space news outlet.

3. **Cambridge Core article (about September 2022 meeting)** - Academic source describing the first in-person meeting of Artemis Accords signatories and explaining the ten principles. Provides reliable historical context and policy background rather than current signatory numbers.

4. **SpaceNews article (January 22, 2025)** - Reports Finland becoming the 53rd signatory on January 21, 2025, and notes 19 countries signed in 2024. Includes quotes from officials and provides context about potential policy changes under the Trump administration. Reliable industry reporting.

5. **SpaceNews article (May 15, 2025)** - The most recent source, reporting Norway becoming the 55th signatory on May 15, 2025. Mentions Finland (January) and Bangladesh (April 8) as previous 2025 signatories. Discusses budget proposals affecting Artemis partnerships. High credibility and recency.

6. **Perplexity report** - Comprehensive analysis of signatory timeline from 2020-2025, confirming Norway as the 55th signatory (May 15, 2025), Bangladesh as 54th (April 8, 2025), and Finland as 53rd (January 21, 2025). While AI-generated, it corroborates information from other sources and provides additional context on signing patterns.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Most suitable reference classes:

1. **Historical Artemis Accords signing rate** - The sources provide detailed data on signatory growth since October 2020, making this the most directly relevant reference class.

2. **Recent signing pace (2025)** - The signing rate has apparently slowed in 2025 compared to 2024, with 3 countries joining in approximately 4.5 months.

3. **Rate under current administration** - SpaceNews mentions Norway as "the third country to join under the new Trump administration," suggesting potential policy shifts.

The first reference class is most appropriate for this forecast given the complete historical data available and direct relevance to the question.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The forecast window is 46 days (May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025).

Analyzing historical patterns:
- 2020: 9 signatories (8 founding + Ukraine)
- 2021: 9 new signatories
- 2022: 12 new signatories
- 2023: 11 new signatories
- 2024: 19 new signatories (highest annual total)
- 2025 (through May 15): 3 signatories (Finland, Bangladesh, Norway)

The 2025 signing rate is approximately 0.67 countries per month, slower than 2024's rate of 1.6 per month. At the current 2025 pace, we might expect 1 additional country to join before July 1.

## (d) Justification

The key facts supporting my outside view:

1. **Current status threshold already achieved**: As of May 15, 2025 (yesterday), the Artemis Accords already have exactly 55 signatories, with Norway being the most recent addition.

2. **Continued interest despite slower pace**: While the 2025 signing rate has slowed compared to 2024, countries continue to join (3 already this year), demonstrating ongoing international interest.

3. **No indications of withdrawals**: None of the sources mention any countries considering withdrawal from the Accords. As voluntary principles reaffirming existing space treaties, there appears to be little incentive to withdraw.

4. **Short timeframe**: With only 46 days until the resolution date, and given the diplomatic processes involved in joining international agreements, major changes to the signatory count are unlikely.

5. **Potential for additional signatories**: The Perplexity report notes NASA and the State Department anticipate continued expansion, particularly among African and Southeast Asian nations, with ongoing dialogues with potential ESA associate members.

6. **Criterion requires ≥55 signatories**: The question resolves as "Yes" if the Accords have 55 OR MORE signatories on July 1, 2025. Since they already have exactly 55, the only path to a "No" outcome would be if one or more countries withdrew.

## Outside view calibration:

I need to calibrate my prediction based on the current reality that the Artemis Accords already have exactly 55 signatories. For the question to resolve as "No," at least one country would need to withdraw from the Accords before July 1, 2025.

Historical evidence suggests no precedent for withdrawals since the Accords' inception in 2020. The voluntary, non-binding nature of the Accords (as emphasized by Finland's Ministry when they joined) means there's minimal legal or political pressure that might prompt withdrawal.

While the SpaceNews article mentions budget proposals affecting Artemis partnerships, these appear to be about implementation rather than participation in the Accords framework itself.

Given the short timeframe (46 days), existing signatory count exactly at the threshold, continued international interest, and absence of any withdrawal indications, I assess a very high probability that the Artemis Accords will have at least 55 signatories on July 1, 2025.

The only significant uncertainty is whether any unpredictable geopolitical events might trigger a withdrawal in this short window, which seems highly unlikely but not impossible.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Space.com ("Artemis Accords: What are they & which countries are involved?")** - January 2023 article providing background on the Accords' purpose and legal foundations. Contains an apparent error claiming 55 signatories "as of May 15, 2025" (a future date from publication), making this specific claim unreliable.

2. **Space.com ("Panama, Austria sign Artemis Accords")** - December 12, 2024 article reporting that Panama and Austria became the 49th and 50th signatories on December 11, 2024. Contains factual information and direct quotes from officials. Reliable source for the milestone of reaching 50 signatories.

3. **Cambridge Core article** - Academic source about the first in-person meeting of signatories (September 2022). Provides valuable background on the Accords' principles and legal framework but no recent signatory counts. High-quality source for understanding the Accords' structure and purpose.

4. **SpaceNews ("Finland signs Artemis Accords")** - January 22, 2025 article reporting Finland as the 53rd signatory. Notes 19 countries signed in 2024, the highest annual total. Mentions potential policy shifts under the new Trump administration. Reliable industry news source with expert quotes.

5. **SpaceNews ("Norway signs Artemis Accords")** - May 15, 2025 article confirming Norway as the 55th signatory. Notes Finland (January) and Bangladesh (April 8) as the other 2025 additions. Raises concerns about potential budget cuts affecting Artemis partnerships. Very recent and directly relevant to our question.

6. **Perplexity Report** - Comprehensive timeline of Artemis Accords signatories (2020-2025). Corroborates the progression from 8 founding members to 55 current signatories. Notes that no additional countries have publicly announced plans to join by mid-2025. Well-structured synthesis with multiple citations.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several reference classes could apply:

1. **Historical signatory rate** - The most relevant reference class shows:
   - 2020: 9 total signatories (+9)
   - 2021: 18 total signatories (+9)
   - 2022: 30 total signatories (+12)
   - 2023: 41 total signatories (+11)
   - 2024: 50 total by December (+9 in 11 months), 19 total for the year
   - 2025: 55 total by May 15 (+5 in 4.5 months)

2. **Signatory additions under different US administrations**:
   - First Trump administration (2020): 9 countries
   - Biden administration (2021-2024): ~41 countries
   - Second Trump administration (2025): 3 countries in 4.5 months

The historical signatory rate provides the most direct insight, particularly the recent patterns of 2024-2025.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

- Today: May 16, 2025
- Target date: July 1, 2025
- Window: 46 days
- Current status: 55 signatories (as of May 15, 2025)

In 2025 so far, the rate of new signatories has been approximately 0.67 per month (3 in 4.5 months), or roughly one new country every 45 days. This timeframe aligns almost exactly with our prediction window of 46 days.

## (d) Justification:

The question resolves as "Yes" if there are 55 or more signatories on July 1, 2025. We already have exactly 55 signatories as of May 15, 2025. For the question to resolve as "No," at least one country would need to withdraw from the Accords with no new additions.

Key considerations:
1. There is no historical precedent for countries withdrawing from the Artemis Accords.
2. Norway's signing on May 15 (just one day before "today") suggests the diplomatic momentum continues, albeit possibly at a slower pace than 2024.
3. The recent signing rate (3 countries in 4.5 months) suggests we might see another country join during our 46-day forecast window.
4. The new Trump administration has not halted new signatories (3 have joined since January 2025).
5. Budget concerns mentioned in the most recent article could potentially affect enthusiasm, but haven't prevented recent additions.
6. No countries have publicly announced plans to join by mid-2025, reducing (but not eliminating) the likelihood of immediate new signatories.

## Outside view calibration:

For a "No" outcome, we would need at least one withdrawal from the Accords with no offsetting additions. Based on:
- Zero historical withdrawals since the Accords' inception in 2020
- Continued additions even during US administration changes
- No reports of signatory countries expressing dissatisfaction

The probability of withdrawal appears extremely low, perhaps 1-2%.

For additions, the current rate (1 country every ~45 days) suggests approximately one new country might join during our forecast window. While no countries have publicly announced plans to join, diplomatic efforts likely continue behind the scenes. I estimate a 30-40% chance of at least one more addition before July 1.

The status quo (55 signatories) already meets the threshold for a "Yes" outcome. The combined probability of the status quo persisting OR of additional countries joining (which would also result in a "Yes") is very high.

## Outside View Prediction:
98% probability of the Artemis Accords having 55 or more signatories on July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. SpaceNews, May 15, 2025 (“Norway signs Artemis Accords,” Jeff Foust)  
      • Facts: Norway became the 55th signatory on May 15, 2025, signing at the Norwegian Space Agency HQ.  
      • Quality: SpaceNews is a specialty publication focused on space policy and business, with a reputation for accurate reporting. Jeff Foust is a veteran space journalist. Opinions are minimal; factual count of signatories is well within their beat.  
   b. Space.com, Jan. 22, 2025 (“Finland signs Artemis Accords”)  
      • Facts: Finland became the 53rd signatory on Jan. 21, 2025.  
      • Quality: Space.com is reputable for space news; the article clearly identifies accession order and source quotes from NASA officials; factual data are reliable.  
   c. Space.com, Dec. 12, 2024 (“Panama, Austria sign, bringing tally to 50”)  
      • Facts: Panama (49th) and Austria (50th) signed Dec. 11, 2024.  
      • Quality: Also high; uses direct NASA statements.  
   d. Cambridge Core article (“Signatories meet in person, Sept. 19, 2022”)  
      • Facts on initial signings and principles; no incremental count beyond early signatories.  
      • Quality: Peer‐reviewed scholarly article; excellent for context but not updated counts.  
   e. Perplexity report  
      • A composite, partly AI‐sourced summary with a detailed timeline.  
      • Quality: Mixed; while it largely mirrors publicly available data, it cites Wikipedia and unverified sources. Use for broad patterns only, not precise counts.

2. Reference-class analysis  
   • Possible classes:  
     1. Growth of voluntary multilateral space agreements (e.g., ISS Intergovernmental Agreement).  
     2. Accumulation of signatories to the Artemis Accords itself (most direct).  
     3. Signatory counts for non-binding international treaties over a fixed horizon.  
   • Suitability: Class 2 is ideal because it directly tracks the same agreement. Historical pattern: 8 founding in Oct 2020; 50 by Dec 2024; 53 by Jan 2025; 55 by mid-May 2025. This gives us a clear, high-resolution trajectory.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Today’s date: May 16, 2025. Resolution date: July 1, 2025. ~45 days out.  
   • Historical pace:  
       – Jan 21 → Finland (#53)  
       – Apr 8 → Bangladesh (#54) (≈2.5 months later)  
       – May 15 → Norway (#55) (≈1.25 months later)  
     Pattern: ~1 country per 1–2 months in early 2025.  
   • Status quo: As of May 15, 2025, the tally stands at 55 signatories. No credible source suggests withdrawals or disputes that would erase existing signatories.

4. Justification  
   • The key determinant is whether the count will hold at ≥ 55 on July 1. Since Norway’s accession on May 15 pushed the count to exactly 55, the question is already settled unless a country formally withdraws (unprecedented in Artemis Accords history) or a reporting error emerges.  
   • Historical pattern strongly favors retention—no withdrawals have ever occurred.  
   • The only plausible risk is source error. But SpaceNews and Space.com corroborate the 55 count independently, and NASA press releases would likely note any correction.  
   • Thus, outside-view base rate for retaining ≥ 55 by July 1, 2025 is extremely high.

Outside view calibration:

• Base rate: Given that the milestone of 55 has already been achieved as of May 15, and no withdrawals have ever happened in the Artemis Accords’ history, the probability of maintaining ≥ 55 through July 1 is essentially the probability that the reporting is correct and no extraordinary political reversal occurs.  
• Up‐ or downward adjustments:  
   – Upward: The fact that signings are deliberate and permanent pushes the probability toward certainty.  
   – Downward: Tiny risk (< 1%) of reporting error or a country doing an unprecedented withdrawal.  

Outside View Prediction:

I assign a 99% probability that the Artemis Accords will have 55 or more signatories on July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Space.com (Dec. 12 2024, Samantha Mathewson): Reports that Panama and Austria became the 49th and 50th signatories on Dec. 11, 2024. Reputable space‐news outlet, draws on NASA press releases and named quotes (e.g., Bill Nelson); factual on the count and dates, minimal opinion.  
2. SpaceNews (Jan. 22 2025, Jeff Foust): Reports Finland as the 53rd signatory on Jan. 21 2025. Highly regarded trade journal; facts are sourced to NASA and official Finnish statements.  
3. SpaceNews (May 15 2025, Jeff Foust): Reports Norway signing as the 55th agreement on May 15 2025. Same outlet, detailed, sourced to Norwegian Space Agency and U.S. embassy; factual.  
4. Cambridge Core (American Journal of International Law): Background on the Accords’ principles and meetings. Authoritative academic source; mostly context, not timeline.  
5. Perplexity report: Aggregated timeline of signings up to May 2025. Useful cross‐check; may contain minor errors but aligns with primary sources on Norway’s accession.  

All primary counts and dates (50 on Dec 2024, 53 in Jan 2025, 55 in May 2025) are corroborated by NASA statements and reputable outlets. No source reports any withdrawals or suspensions.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
• Growth and retention of voluntary international treaties / accords.  
• Month‐to‐resolution forecasts of threshold‐meeting events already achieved.  
• Historical rate of additions to the Artemis Accords.  

Most suitable: “Month‐to‐resolution forecasts of threshold‐meeting events already achieved,” because as of today (May 16 2025) the threshold (55 signatories) is already met. In analogous questions—once a countable threshold is exceeded well in advance, non‐reversal is highly likely.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
– Today: May 16 2025.  
– Resolution date: July 1 2025 (47 days away).  
– Historical pattern: No signatory has ever withdrawn; additions occur irregularly but never negative. Once a country signs a non‐binding voluntary diplomatic accord, it has always remained a party.  

(d) Justification  
• The question asks whether there will be ≥55 signatories on July 1 2025. As of May 15 2025, there are already exactly 55.  
• No historical precedent for withdrawal from the Artemis Accords or for signatory counts to drop.  
• With 47 days to go, the only way to fail is if a signatory formally withdraws or NASA/state publication fails to record an existing signatory, both extremely unlikely given the political and symbolic value of membership.  
• Reference‐class reasoning: events already achieved and recorded so far ahead of the deadline almost always remain in place.  

Outside view calibration:

Given that the threshold is already met and there is near‐zero historical probability of reversal or reporting failure, the outside view probability that the Accords will still list at least 55 signatories on July 1 2025 is extremely high. However, allow a small margin (<1%) for political oddities or reporting lags.

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Space.com (Jan 22 2023, “Artemis Accords: What are they & which countries are involved?”)  
   – Facts: explains purpose, legal basis, early history; claims “55 countries have signed … as of May 15 2025.”  
   – Quality: generally reliable for space news, but the 2025-dated tally embedded in a 2023 article signals a rolling update, so treat numbers as descriptive, not predictive. Almost entirely factual; minimal opinion.  

2. Space.com (Dec 12 2024, Panama & Austria bring total to 50)  
   – Facts: signing dates, dignitaries, running total.  
   – Opinions: positive quotes from NASA leadership; clearly attributable; little analytic weight for forecasting.  
   – Quality: good; corroborated in other outlets.  

3. Cambridge Core / AJIL note (Sept 2022 first in-person meeting)  
   – Facts: describes structure and ten principles, notes 21 signatories at the time.  
   – Opinions: critiques from scholars and mention of Chinese/Russian objections. High-quality peer-review context; historical only.  

4. SpaceNews (Jan 22 2025, Finland #53)  
   – Facts: date, sequence number, comments on 2024 pace (19 additions).  
   – Opinions: Garver & Pace speculate on Trump-era diplomacy; expert but speculative, used only to gauge downside risk.  
   – Quality: SpaceNews is a trade publication with good factual accuracy.  

5. SpaceNews (May 15 2025, Norway #55)  
   – Facts: Norway signing, #55, context on current U.S. budget debate.  
   – Opinions: Alex MacDonald warns of possible partner unease if Gateway cancelled; expert but not directly about withdrawals.  
   – Quality: fresh, specific, strongly corroborated (NASA press release).  

6. Perplexity summary of signatory timeline (May 2025)  
   – Synthesises public sources; useful for counts & dates but second-hand. Cross-checked with primary articles where possible.  
   – Opinions are minimal; treat as convenient compilation, not authoritative.  

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Growth curves of recent multilateral, non-binding space or tech agreements (e.g., Paris Call on Cybersecurity).  
• Year-to-year expansion rates of the Artemis Accords themselves (direct historical series).  
• Withdrawal frequency from lightweight political pledges within five-year windows.  

Suitability: The most relevant reference class is the agreement’s own five-year growth record because it captures unique incentives (access to NASA partnerships, low legal cost, U.S. diplomatic push). No withdrawals have occurred. Hence I adopt: “Monthly net change in Artemis Accords signatories.”  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time until resolution: 46 days (16 May → 1 Jul 2025).  
Historical pattern:  
• 2020: +9 in 2.5 months ≈ 3.6/mo  
• 2021: +9 in 12 months ≈ 0.75/mo  
• 2022: +12 in 12 months ≈ 1.0/mo  
• 2023: +11 in 12 months ≈ 0.9/mo  
• 2024: +19 in 12 months ≈ 1.6/mo  
• 2025 YTD: +3 in 4.5 months ≈ 0.7/mo  

Base-rate expectation for the next 1.5 months ≈ 0.7 × 1.5 ≈ 1 new signatory (Poisson λ≈1).  

Withdrawal base-rate: zero observed in 55 cases over 55 × (average tenure 2 yrs) ≈ 110 signatory-years → empirical rate <0.01/yr. Probability that at least one withdraws in 46 days ≈ <0.1%. (Outside view rounded up to 1% to acknowledge model uncertainty.)  

(d) Justification  
• Threshold of 55 has already been reached with Norway’s accession on 15 May 2025.  
• To resolve “No,” at least one withdrawal must occur *and* no additional country may sign before 1 Jul 2025.  
• Political or budget frictions (e.g., Trump administration signalling reduced Artemis funding) could slow new accessions but would have to trigger an unprecedented withdrawal inside seven weeks—unlikely given the low-stakes, non-binding nature and reputational cost of backing out.  
• Base-rate of gaining ≈1 more signatory by 1 Jul boosts the margin further.  
• Expert sentiment (NASA, State Dept., space-policy analysts) continues to frame the Accords positively; no signatory has publicly signalled regret.  

Outside view calibration:

Anchor 1 – Current status: already at 55 → starting point 95%.  
Anchor 2 – Withdrawal risk (estimate 1%) → 95 × 0.99 ≈ 94%.  
Anchor 3 – Probability of at least one *additional* signing (Poisson λ≈1) → P(≥0) = 1, so cancellation risk diluted further; add ~4 pp.  
Rounded outside-view probability ≈ 98%.  

Outside View Prediction:

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Space.com article (Dec 12, 2024)** - Reports Panama and Austria becoming the 49th and 50th signatories on December 11, 2024. Includes quotes from NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and provides background on the Accords. Highly reliable space news source with concrete details from official statements.

2. **OpenTools.ai news article (undated but recent)** - Reports Norway becoming the 55th signatory to the Artemis Accords. The article describes a signing ceremony in Oslo with NASA and Norwegian Space Agency representatives. While the exact date isn't specified, the context suggests this is recent—likely May 2025. Moderate reliability as it cites an "Official announcement" on Morningstar.

3. **SpaceNews article (Dec 12, 2024)** - Corroborates information about Panama and Austria becoming the 49th and 50th signatories. Provides additional context about the growth rate (17 countries joined in 2024) and includes quotes from NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, State Department officials, and former NASA official Mike Gold. High reliability with specific details and multiple expert sources.

4. **News.satnews article (Dec 11, 2024)** - Another source confirming Panama and Austria as the 49th and 50th signatories. Contains quotes from officials and specific information about the December 11, 2024 signing ceremonies. Good reliability with named sources.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current signatory count has reached 55**: The OpenTools.ai article explicitly states Norway is the 55th signatory, indicating the threshold for the question has already been met. This is the most directly relevant fact to the forecast question.
- **Historical growth pattern**: SpaceNews notes 17 countries joined in 2024 alone (one-third of all signatories at that point), demonstrating strong momentum and international interest in the Accords.
- **Absence of withdrawal indicators**: None of the sources mention any countries considering withdrawal from the Accords, which would be the only way for the count to drop below 55 by July 1.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Timing of Norway's signing**: While Norway is confirmed as the 55th signatory, the exact date isn't specified. However, its inclusion as current information for a May 16, 2025 forecast suggests this is a recent development.
- **Diplomatic stability of space agreements**: The Artemis Accords are described as voluntary principles building on existing space treaties, suggesting limited incentive for withdrawal, especially in a short timeframe.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Identity of signatories #51-54**: The sources don't specify which countries became the 51st through 54th signatories or when they joined, creating some information gaps in the growth timeline between December 2024 and May 2025.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

From May 16, 2025 (today) to July 1, 2025 (resolution date) is 46 days.

If the timeframe were halved (~23 days), my prediction would remain virtually unchanged because:
- The threshold of 55 signatories appears to have already been met
- Diplomatic processes for formal withdrawal typically take longer than a few weeks
- There's no indication of any pending withdrawals

If the timeframe were doubled (~92 days), the probability might shift slightly:
- More time would increase the small possibility of a geopolitical event triggering a withdrawal
- Conversely, it would also increase the likelihood of additional signatories joining, which would only further support a "Yes" outcome

## (d) Justification

The most compelling factors in this forecast are:

1. **Threshold already achieved**: Based on the OpenTools.ai article, Norway has become the 55th signatory, meaning the current count already satisfies the resolution criteria of "55 (or more) signatories."

2. **Strong historical growth trend**: The Accords have shown consistent growth since inception in 2020, with acceleration in 2024 (17 new signatories), demonstrating robust international interest.

3. **Short timeframe until resolution**: With only 46 days until July 1, and no indication of any pending withdrawals, there's limited opportunity for the signatory count to drop below 55.

4. **Nature of the agreement**: The Artemis Accords are described as voluntary principles building on existing treaties, providing countries limited incentive to withdraw, especially in such a short timeframe.

5. **Additional growth potential**: State Department officials noted in December 2024 that they expected the pace of new signatories to continue despite the US administration transition. This suggests the possibility of the count increasing beyond 55 by July 1, further supporting a "Yes" outcome.

# Probability calibration

Given that the current signatory count already appears to meet the threshold (55) and there is no indication of any country considering withdrawal, I assess a very high probability that the Artemis Accords will have at least 55 signatories on July 1, 2025.

The primary uncertainties are:
1. The exact timing of Norway's signing (though it appears to be recent)
2. The possibility of unexpected diplomatic developments leading to withdrawal
3. Potential geopolitical events that could impact space cooperation

Given the voluntary nature of the Accords, the historical pattern of steady growth, and the short timeframe until resolution, I believe the chance of dropping below 55 signatories is very small but not impossible. A severe geopolitical crisis involving space-related tensions could potentially trigger a withdrawal, but even this would likely take longer than the available 46 days to formally process.

Considering these factors, I calibrate my forecast at 98%.

# Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Artemis Accords have at least 55 signatories on July 1, 2025? (Threshold appears already met with Norway as 55th)
2. Base rate: Historical growth consistent, accelerated in 2024 (17 new signatories). Current count: 55.
3. Consistency: 98/100 times, the Accords will have ≥55 signatories on July 1, 2025, given current count and unlikely withdrawals.
4. Key evidence: Norway is 55th signatory; No withdrawal indications; Strong historical growth; Short timeframe limits diplomatic reversals.
5. Blind-spot: Major space-related geopolitical crisis could prompt withdrawals, though unlikely to complete within 46 days.
6. Status quo: Currently at 55 signatories, which satisfies resolution criteria; formal diplomatic processes change slowly.

Probability: 98%
Predicted Probability: 98.0%

   - Bangladesh (54th) on April 8, 2025
   - Norway (55th) on May 15, 2025 (from SpaceNews, by Jeff Foust)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current count at threshold**: Norway became the 55th signatory on May 15, 2025, exactly meeting the resolution criteria with 45 days to spare.
- **No historical withdrawals**: Since inception in 2020, no country has ever withdrawn from the Artemis Accords.
- **Consistent growth trajectory**: The Accords grew from 8 founding signatories (Oct. 2020) to 50 (Dec. 2024) to 55 (May 2025), demonstrating sustained diplomatic momentum.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Accelerating adoption rate**: 17 countries joined in 2024 alone, and 5 more in the first 4.5 months of 2025.
- **Expert expectations**: State Department space official Valda Vikmanis predicted continued signing pace through the U.S. administration transition.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Absence of reported controversies**: No sources mention potential withdrawals or disputes, though absence of evidence isn't necessarily evidence of absence.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis
- Resolution date is July 1, 2025, which is 45 days from today (May 16, 2025).
- If timeframe were halved (~22 days), my prediction would remain identical since the threshold has already been reached and withdrawals are unprecedented.
- If timeframe were doubled (~90 days), confidence might slightly increase as additional countries could join (based on the recent pace of ~1 country every 1-2 months), providing buffer against any unexpected withdrawals.

## (d) Justification
The most compelling factors supporting a very high probability:

1. **Threshold already achieved**: With Norway's signature on May 15, 2025, the Artemis Accords have precisely 55 signatories, already satisfying the resolution criteria.

2. **Institutional stability**: In nearly 5 years since the Accords' inception, no country has withdrawn its signature, suggesting strong diplomatic commitment once countries join.

3. **Continuous growth pattern**: The Accords have demonstrated consistent growth across different U.S. administrations and global political environments, with acceleration rather than deceleration in recent periods.

4. **Formal, transparent process**: The signing ceremonies are public diplomatic events with witnesses, formal documentation, and official announcements, making the count reliable.

The only scenarios where the criteria wouldn't be met would involve either an unprecedented withdrawal (which has never occurred) or a major reporting error across multiple sources (unlikely given the formal nature of these diplomatic events).

# Probability calibration

The outside view established a 99% probability that the Artemis Accords will have ≥55 signatories on July 1, 2025.

After analyzing the current evidence:
- The key threshold of 55 has already been achieved as of May 15, 2025
- There is zero historical precedent for withdrawals
- The formal nature of diplomatic accessions makes the count reliable
- Multiple reputable sources confirm the current count

I see no compelling reason to adjust the outside view probability. The 99% figure accurately reflects that only extremely unlikely scenarios (unprecedented withdrawals or major reporting errors) would prevent the criteria from being met.

If I were to make any adjustment, I might marginally decrease confidence to 98% to account for remote geopolitical risks, but this would be overly cautious given the evidence.

# Checklist:
1. Will the Artemis Accords have 55+ signatories on July 1, 2025? Resolution based on official count on that specific date.
2. Outside view: 99% based on historical signing patterns, current count, and absence of withdrawals.
3. Consistency: 99 out of 100 times, the Accords will have ≥55 signatories on July 1, as threshold is already met with no withdrawal precedent.
4. Key evidence: (1) Norway became 55th signatory on May 15; (2) No country has ever withdrawn since 2020; (3) Consistent growth pattern; (4) Multiple sources confirm current count.
5. Blind spot: A major geopolitical crisis causing withdrawal(s) before July 1.
6. Status quo: Current count is exactly 55; natural trajectory suggests potential additions rather than losses.

Probability: 99%
Predicted Probability: 99%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase and resolution criteria  
   The question asks: “Will the Artemis Accords have at least 55 signatories on July 1, 2025?” The outcome is Yes if signatories ≥ 55 on that date; No otherwise. Today is May 16, 2025, so we have a 46-day window.

2. Source analysis  
   a. Space.com (Dec 12, 2024): Reports Panama (49th) and Austria (50th) signed on Dec 11, 2024. Well-sourced (NASA, ambassadors), high reliability for the 50-country milestone.  
   b. SpaceNews (Jan 22, 2025): Finland became 53rd signatory. Industry‐standard publication, directly citing NASA and State Dept officials—reliable.  
   c. SpaceNews (May 15, 2025): Norway signed, becoming 55th signatory (with Bangladesh having joined in April as 54th). Quotes NASA, Norwegian Space Agency; timely and reliable.  
   d. Perplexity timeline (2020–mid-2025): Synthesizes signatory progression; corroborates counts and dates. Secondary but high confidence.

3. Evidence analysis  
   • Strong evidence:  
     – Historical absence of withdrawals from the Accords since 2020 (structural/institutional stability).  
     – Reliable, up-to-date counts from SpaceNews confirming 55 signatories as of May 15, 2025.  
   • Moderate evidence:  
     – Ongoing diplomatic momentum: 17 countries in 2024, plus three in early 2025 (Finland, Bangladesh, Norway).  
     – Reference‐class expansion rates: roughly one new signatory every 45 days so far in 2025.  
   • Weak evidence:  
     – Budgetary concerns under the new U.S. administration could slow future signings but have not yet halted them.  
     – No public announcements of additional imminent signings.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   • Forecast window: 46 days (May 16–July 1, 2025).  
   • Recent rate: ~1 signatory per 45 days in 2025 suggests ~1 additional signing is possible but not necessary for a Yes.  
   • If the window were halved (23 days), the chance of a new signing falls to ~50% of the 46-day rate, but status quo (55) still meets the threshold.  
   • If doubled (92 days), a new signatory is very likely—strengthening the Yes case further.

5. Justification and inside‐view adjustment  
   Base‐rate (outside view) of crossing the 55 threshold by mid-2025 was already high because signatory growth has been steady and no withdrawals have occurred historically. Today’s status quo is already 55, so “Yes” merely requires no withdrawals, or any new additions—both highly likely.  
   Key factors:  
   – Institutional stickiness: No precedent for withdrawal (strong evidence) → very low downside risk.  
   – Current signatory count equals the threshold (strong evidence) → status quo suffices.  
   – Continued albeit slower additions under a new U.S. administration (moderate evidence) → slight upside.  
   – No credible withdrawal threats; budget concerns so far have not deterred signings (weak evidence) → minimal downside.  

   These factors all push the probability toward the near‐ceiling.

Probability calibration  
I estimate ~1–2% chance of an unexpected withdrawal or technical disqualification of a signatory, with near‐zero chance the count will fall below 55. There is also a 30–40% chance of at least one additional country joining by July 1, which would only solidify the Yes outcome. Balancing these gives a final probability of 98%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast if Artemis Accords have ≥ 55 signatories by July 1, 2025 (46-day window).  
2. Base‐rate distribution: Historically steady signatory growth, no withdrawals—baseline Yes probability ~90–95%.  
3. Consistency check: “In 98 out of 100 scenarios, signatories ≥ 55 by July 1, 2025.” This aligns: status quo = 55, no withdrawals = very high.  
4. Top evidence:  
   a. SpaceNews May 15: 55 signatories confirmed (strong).  
   b. Historical zero withdrawals (strong).  
   c. Ongoing additions under admin change (moderate).  
   d. Rate of ~1 new signatory/45 days (moderate).  
5. Blind‐spot: An unlikely mass withdrawal or re-interpretation of criteria (e.g., deeming a signatory non-compliant). This remains highly improbable.  
6. Status quo: The count already meets the threshold, and the situation is stable.

Probability: 98%
Predicted Probability: 98.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Space.com (Dec. 12, 2024): Samantha Mathewson reports Panama and Austria became the 49th and 50th signatories on Dec. 11, 2024. High-quality, draws on NASA press releases and direct quotes from Bill Nelson; factual reporting.  
• SpaceNews (Jan. 22, 2025): Jeff Foust reports Finland as the 53rd signatory on Jan. 21, 2025, sourcing NASA and Finnish space authority statements. Reputable industry journal, clear sourcing.  
• OpenTools.ai article (May 15, 2025): “Welcome, Norway!” reports Norway’s signing as the 55th on May 15, 2025, citing NASA and Norwegian Space Agency. Credible, though secondary aggregator.  
• Cambridge Core (American Journal of International Law): Background on the Accords’ legal principles and diplomatic context. Authoritative academic source but no new count data.  
• Perplexity summary (May 2025): Aggregates timeline of signings up to 55. Useful corroboration but treated as tertiary.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts)  
  • Direct count data: 55 signatories already recorded as of May 15, 2025 (SpaceNews/OpenTools).  
  • No historical withdrawals from the Artemis Accords or analogous non-binding space treaties.  
  • Institutional inertia: once countries publicly commit, reversals are extremely rare.  
Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)  
  • Ongoing geopolitical tensions (e.g., U.S.–China) could theoretically prompt withdrawal, but China never joined, and major space rivals have remained observers.  
  • NASA/state-department emphasis on stability and diplomacy through the next administration.  
Weak evidence (small shifts)  
  • Reporting lags: if a package of signatures were mis-recorded—but counts are cross-checked by multiple outlets.  
  • Domestic political shifts in a single member state unlikely to trigger withdrawal given reputational costs.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
  • Today is May 16, 2025; resolution on July 1, 2025 (47 days away).  
  • With 47 days left, reversals would require formal notification by a signatory of its withdrawal or a clerical de-listing. Both are unprecedented and need diplomatic processes ≥ months.  
  • If timeframe were halved (≈23 days), probability of reversal remains effectively unchanged (still near zero). If doubled (≈94 days), same reasoning applies—no precedent for reversal in that span.  

(d) Justification  
1. Baseline (“outside view”): Once a countable threshold of signatories is met well before deadline, analogous treaties do not lose members. Base-rate probability of retention ≈ 99.9%.  
2. Current factors (inside view):  
   – Threshold already met (55 on May 15, 2025).  
   – Zero historical withdrawals.  
   – Cross-verified by multiple reliable sources.  
   – Political incentives strongly favor maintaining or increasing membership, not withdrawal.  
3. Risks:  
   – Extremely unlikely diplomatic spats could prompt a withdrawal by a minor participant, but the process requires formal steps and public notice, which would be reported widely.  
4. Adjustment:  
   – Trim base-rate slightly (from 99.9% to 99%) to allow for unprecedented events (e.g., a sudden policy reversal in one signatory).  

Probability calibration  
My inside-view probability reflects near certainty, with a small (<1%) allowance for unprecedented diplomatic reversal or reporting error.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will there be at least 55 Artemis Accords signatories on July 1, 2025?” (Threshold already met on May 15, 2025).  
2. Outside view base rate: Threshold-exceeded outcomes very rarely reverse (≈0%).  
3. Consistency: “99 out of 100 times, once a voluntary international agreement reaches a recorded threshold well before deadline, it remains at or above that level.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 55 signatories recorded (May 15, 2025).  
   • No historical withdrawals.  
   • Multiple independent, reliable sources confirming count.  
5. Blind spot: A surprise mass-withdrawal from an emerging power triggered by political crisis; still needs formal process and would be reported.  
6. Status quo: Membership counts in voluntary space treaties are stable; status quo strongly favors “Yes.”

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Space.com 12 Dec 2024 – reports Panama (#49) and Austria (#50) signings. Straight factual event coverage, corroborated elsewhere; high reliability; no material opinion except celebratory quotes.  
2. SpaceNews 12 Dec 2024 – identical facts plus context, quotes from NASA/State Dept.; trade publication with strong record; high reliability.  
3. Space.com living article (rolling update, consulted 16 May 2025) – states “55 nations as of 15 May 2025.” Factual tally, but single-author maintained page; treat as moderately reliable.  
4. SpaceNews 15 May 2025 – reports Norway signing, explicitly calling it the 55th accession. Includes NASA press-release reference; high reliability; key datum.  
5. “OpenTools.ai” blog post on Norway (#55) – repeats NASA information; unknown outlet, use only as secondary corroboration; moderate reliability.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Independent confirmation (SpaceNews + NASA press release) that Norway became signatory #55 on 15 May 2025.  
• Four-year historical record: 0 withdrawals from any of the now-55 signatories.  
• Institutional incentive: Accords are non-binding, reputationally positive; withdrawal would carry diplomatic cost, providing structural stickiness.  

Moderate evidence  
• Growth momentum: 3 new accessions in first 4.5 months of 2025 → ~0.7 mo⁻¹; Poisson expectation ≈1 additional accession before 1 Jul.  
• Statements from State Dept. officials (Littlejohn, Vikmanis) expecting continued sign-ups through Administration change.  

Weak evidence  
• Speculation that an incoming U.S. administration might scale back Artemis and dampen enthusiasm (mentioned by a single analyst).  
• Chinese/Russian diplomatic pressure against the Accords (periodic commentary) – no sign it has induced any withdrawal to date.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until resolution: 46.  
If timeframe were halved (23 d): withdrawal probability slightly lower still; probability of additional sign-ups also lower but irrelevant—count already ≥55. Net probability would rise about +1 pp.  
If timeframe doubled (92 d): small increase in chance of an unprecedented withdrawal and larger chance of additional accessions. Net probability would fall perhaps −1 pp. Overall sensitivity low.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base (current count ≥55 → 95%).  
− Withdrawal risk: Empirical frequency <0.01/yr · 55 states · 0.125 yr ≈0.07% → round to 1 % to acknowledge model & reporting uncertainties → 94%.  
+ Chance of clerical mis-count corrected downward to 54 judged <1% (all signings announced by NASA and deposited with U.S. State Dept.).  
+ Probability of new signatories before 1 Jul (≈60%) cannot hurt the “Yes” outcome, adds small cushion (+2 pp).  

Resulting inside view ≈97%.  
No single presently visible factor plausibly knocks two or more countries out within six weeks; even one withdrawal is historically unprecedented.  

Probability calibration
Range of reasonable beliefs among informed watchers: 92–99%. My median: 97 %.  A ±10 pp shift would imply believing either multiple imminent withdrawals (dropping to 87 %) or perfect certainty in bureaucratic counts (up to 107 % impossible). Hence 97 % reflects remaining tail-risks without overconfidence.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will there be at least 55 Artemis-Accords signatories on 1 Jul 2025?”  
2. Base rate: after Norway, status quo already satisfies criterion → 95 %.  
3. Consistency: “In 97 of 100 comparable worlds, the tally is ≥55 on 1 Jul 2025.”  
4. Key evidence  
   • Norway became #55 on 15 May 2025 (NASA/SpaceNews).  
   • Zero withdrawals since launch.  
   • Only 46 days left.  
   • Accords are non-binding & reputationally valuable.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden geopolitical incident (e.g., U.S. cancels Artemis, triggering coordinated protest withdrawals). Probability judged <3 %.  
6. Status-quo: Already met; inertia favours “Yes”.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Space.com article (Dec 12, 2024)** - Reports Panama and Austria becoming the 49th and 50th signatories on December 11, 2024. Includes quotes from NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and provides background on the Accords. Highly reliable space news source with concrete details from official statements.

2. **OpenTools.ai news article (undated but recent)** - Reports Norway becoming the 55th signatory to the Artemis Accords. The article describes a signing ceremony in Oslo with NASA and Norwegian Space Agency representatives. While the exact date isn't specified, the context suggests this is recent—likely May 2025. Moderate reliability as it cites an "Official announcement" on Morningstar.

3. **SpaceNews article (Dec 12, 2024)** - Corroborates information about Panama and Austria becoming the 49th and 50th signatories. Provides additional context about the growth rate (17 countries joined in 2024) and includes quotes from NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, State Department officials, and former NASA official Mike Gold. High reliability with specific details and multiple expert sources.

4. **News.satnews article (Dec 11, 2024)** - Another source confirming Panama and Austria as the 49th and 50th signatories. Contains quotes from officials and specific information about the December 11, 2024 signing ceremonies. Good reliability with named sources.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current signatory count has reached 55**: The OpenTools.ai article explicitly states Norway is the 55th signatory, indicating the threshold for the question has already been met. This is the most directly relevant fact to the forecast question.
- **Historical growth pattern**: SpaceNews notes 17 countries joined in 2024 alone (one-third of all signatories at that point), demonstrating strong momentum and international interest in the Accords.
- **Absence of withdrawal indicators**: None of the sources mention any countries considering withdrawal from the Accords, which would be the only way for the count to drop below 55 by July 1.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Timing of Norway's signing**: While Norway is confirmed as the 55th signatory, the exact date isn't specified. However, its inclusion as current information for a May 16, 2025 forecast suggests this is a recent development.
- **Diplomatic stability of space agreements**: The Artemis Accords are described as voluntary principles building on existing space treaties, suggesting limited incentive for withdrawal, especially in a short timeframe.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Identity of signatories #51-54**: The sources don't specify which countries became the 51st through 54th signatories or when they joined, creating some information gaps in the growth timeline between December 2024 and May 2025.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

From May 16, 2025 (today) to July 1, 2025 (resolution date) is 46 days.

If the timeframe were halved (~23 days), my prediction would remain virtually unchanged because:
- The threshold of 55 signatories appears to have already been met
- Diplomatic processes for formal withdrawal typically take longer than a few weeks
- There's no indication of any pending withdrawals

If the timeframe were doubled (~92 days), the probability might shift slightly:
- More time would increase the small possibility of a geopolitical event triggering a withdrawal
- Conversely, it would also increase the likelihood of additional signatories joining, which would only further support a "Yes" outcome

## (d) Justification

The most compelling factors in this forecast are:

1. **Threshold already achieved**: Based on the OpenTools.ai article, Norway has become the 55th signatory, meaning the current count already satisfies the resolution criteria of "55 (or more) signatories."

2. **Strong historical growth trend**: The Accords have shown consistent growth since inception in 2020, with acceleration in 2024 (17 new signatories), demonstrating robust international interest.

3. **Short timeframe until resolution**: With only 46 days until July 1, and no indication of any pending withdrawals, there's limited opportunity for the signatory count to drop below 55.

4. **Nature of the agreement**: The Artemis Accords are described as voluntary principles building on existing treaties, providing countries limited incentive to withdraw, especially in such a short timeframe.

5. **Additional growth potential**: State Department officials noted in December 2024 that they expected the pace of new signatories to continue despite the US administration transition. This suggests the possibility of the count increasing beyond 55 by July 1, further supporting a "Yes" outcome.

# Probability calibration

Given that the current signatory count already appears to meet the threshold (55) and there is no indication of any country considering withdrawal, I assess a very high probability that the Artemis Accords will have at least 55 signatories on July 1, 2025.

The primary uncertainties are:
1. The exact timing of Norway's signing (though it appears to be recent)
2. The possibility of unexpected diplomatic developments leading to withdrawal
3. Potential geopolitical events that could impact space cooperation

Given the voluntary nature of the Accords, the historical pattern of steady growth, and the short timeframe until resolution, I believe the chance of dropping below 55 signatories is very small but not impossible. A severe geopolitical crisis involving space-related tensions could potentially trigger a withdrawal, but even this would likely take longer than the available 46 days to formally process.

Considering these factors, I calibrate my forecast at 98%.

# Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Artemis Accords have at least 55 signatories on July 1, 2025? (Threshold appears already met with Norway as 55th)
2. Base rate: Historical growth consistent, accelerated in 2024 (17 new signatories). Current count: 55.
3. Consistency: 98/100 times, the Accords will have ≥55 signatories on July 1, 2025, given current count and unlikely withdrawals.
4. Key evidence: Norway is 55th signatory; No withdrawal indications; Strong historical growth; Short timeframe limits diplomatic reversals.
5. Blind-spot: Major space-related geopolitical crisis could prompt withdrawals, though unlikely to complete within 46 days.
6. Status quo: Currently at 55 signatories, which satisfies resolution criteria; formal diplomatic processes change slowly.

Probability: 98%
Predicted Probability: 98.0%

   - Bangladesh (54th) on April 8, 2025
   - Norway (55th) on May 15, 2025 (from SpaceNews, by Jeff Foust)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current count at threshold**: Norway became the 55th signatory on May 15, 2025, exactly meeting the resolution criteria with 45 days to spare.
- **No historical withdrawals**: Since inception in 2020, no country has ever withdrawn from the Artemis Accords.
- **Consistent growth trajectory**: The Accords grew from 8 founding signatories (Oct. 2020) to 50 (Dec. 2024) to 55 (May 2025), demonstrating sustained diplomatic momentum.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Accelerating adoption rate**: 17 countries joined in 2024 alone, and 5 more in the first 4.5 months of 2025.
- **Expert expectations**: State Department space official Valda Vikmanis predicted continued signing pace through the U.S. administration transition.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Absence of reported controversies**: No sources mention potential withdrawals or disputes, though absence of evidence isn't necessarily evidence of absence.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis
- Resolution date is July 1, 2025, which is 45 days from today (May 16, 2025).
- If timeframe were halved (~22 days), my prediction would remain identical since the threshold has already been reached and withdrawals are unprecedented.
- If timeframe were doubled (~90 days), confidence might slightly increase as additional countries could join (based on the recent pace of ~1 country every 1-2 months), providing buffer against any unexpected withdrawals.

## (d) Justification
The most compelling factors supporting a very high probability:

1. **Threshold already achieved**: With Norway's signature on May 15, 2025, the Artemis Accords have precisely 55 signatories, already satisfying the resolution criteria.

2. **Institutional stability**: In nearly 5 years since the Accords' inception, no country has withdrawn its signature, suggesting strong diplomatic commitment once countries join.

3. **Continuous growth pattern**: The Accords have demonstrated consistent growth across different U.S. administrations and global political environments, with acceleration rather than deceleration in recent periods.

4. **Formal, transparent process**: The signing ceremonies are public diplomatic events with witnesses, formal documentation, and official announcements, making the count reliable.

The only scenarios where the criteria wouldn't be met would involve either an unprecedented withdrawal (which has never occurred) or a major reporting error across multiple sources (unlikely given the formal nature of these diplomatic events).

# Probability calibration

The outside view established a 99% probability that the Artemis Accords will have ≥55 signatories on July 1, 2025.

After analyzing the current evidence:
- The key threshold of 55 has already been achieved as of May 15, 2025
- There is zero historical precedent for withdrawals
- The formal nature of diplomatic accessions makes the count reliable
- Multiple reputable sources confirm the current count

I see no compelling reason to adjust the outside view probability. The 99% figure accurately reflects that only extremely unlikely scenarios (unprecedented withdrawals or major reporting errors) would prevent the criteria from being met.

If I were to make any adjustment, I might marginally decrease confidence to 98% to account for remote geopolitical risks, but this would be overly cautious given the evidence.

# Checklist:
1. Will the Artemis Accords have 55+ signatories on July 1, 2025? Resolution based on official count on that specific date.
2. Outside view: 99% based on historical signing patterns, current count, and absence of withdrawals.
3. Consistency: 99 out of 100 times, the Accords will have ≥55 signatories on July 1, as threshold is already met with no withdrawal precedent.
4. Key evidence: (1) Norway became 55th signatory on May 15; (2) No country has ever withdrawn since 2020; (3) Consistent growth pattern; (4) Multiple sources confirm current count.
5. Blind spot: A major geopolitical crisis causing withdrawal(s) before July 1.
6. Status quo: Current count is exactly 55; natural trajectory suggests potential additions rather than losses.

Probability: 99%
Predicted Probability: 99%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase and resolution criteria  
   The question asks: “Will the Artemis Accords have at least 55 signatories on July 1, 2025?” The outcome is Yes if signatories ≥ 55 on that date; No otherwise. Today is May 16, 2025, so we have a 46-day window.

2. Source analysis  
   a. Space.com (Dec 12, 2024): Reports Panama (49th) and Austria (50th) signed on Dec 11, 2024. Well-sourced (NASA, ambassadors), high reliability for the 50-country milestone.  
   b. SpaceNews (Jan 22, 2025): Finland became 53rd signatory. Industry‐standard publication, directly citing NASA and State Dept officials—reliable.  
   c. SpaceNews (May 15, 2025): Norway signed, becoming 55th signatory (with Bangladesh having joined in April as 54th). Quotes NASA, Norwegian Space Agency; timely and reliable.  
   d. Perplexity timeline (2020–mid-2025): Synthesizes signatory progression; corroborates counts and dates. Secondary but high confidence.

3. Evidence analysis  
   • Strong evidence:  
     – Historical absence of withdrawals from the Accords since 2020 (structural/institutional stability).  
     – Reliable, up-to-date counts from SpaceNews confirming 55 signatories as of May 15, 2025.  
   • Moderate evidence:  
     – Ongoing diplomatic momentum: 17 countries in 2024, plus three in early 2025 (Finland, Bangladesh, Norway).  
     – Reference‐class expansion rates: roughly one new signatory every 45 days so far in 2025.  
   • Weak evidence:  
     – Budgetary concerns under the new U.S. administration could slow future signings but have not yet halted them.  
     – No public announcements of additional imminent signings.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   • Forecast window: 46 days (May 16–July 1, 2025).  
   • Recent rate: ~1 signatory per 45 days in 2025 suggests ~1 additional signing is possible but not necessary for a Yes.  
   • If the window were halved (23 days), the chance of a new signing falls to ~50% of the 46-day rate, but status quo (55) still meets the threshold.  
   • If doubled (92 days), a new signatory is very likely—strengthening the Yes case further.

5. Justification and inside‐view adjustment  
   Base‐rate (outside view) of crossing the 55 threshold by mid-2025 was already high because signatory growth has been steady and no withdrawals have occurred historically. Today’s status quo is already 55, so “Yes” merely requires no withdrawals, or any new additions—both highly likely.  
   Key factors:  
   – Institutional stickiness: No precedent for withdrawal (strong evidence) → very low downside risk.  
   – Current signatory count equals the threshold (strong evidence) → status quo suffices.  
   – Continued albeit slower additions under a new U.S. administration (moderate evidence) → slight upside.  
   – No credible withdrawal threats; budget concerns so far have not deterred signings (weak evidence) → minimal downside.  

   These factors all push the probability toward the near‐ceiling.

Probability calibration  
I estimate ~1–2% chance of an unexpected withdrawal or technical disqualification of a signatory, with near‐zero chance the count will fall below 55. There is also a 30–40% chance of at least one additional country joining by July 1, which would only solidify the Yes outcome. Balancing these gives a final probability of 98%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast if Artemis Accords have ≥ 55 signatories by July 1, 2025 (46-day window).  
2. Base‐rate distribution: Historically steady signatory growth, no withdrawals—baseline Yes probability ~90–95%.  
3. Consistency check: “In 98 out of 100 scenarios, signatories ≥ 55 by July 1, 2025.” This aligns: status quo = 55, no withdrawals = very high.  
4. Top evidence:  
   a. SpaceNews May 15: 55 signatories confirmed (strong).  
   b. Historical zero withdrawals (strong).  
   c. Ongoing additions under admin change (moderate).  
   d. Rate of ~1 new signatory/45 days (moderate).  
5. Blind‐spot: An unlikely mass withdrawal or re-interpretation of criteria (e.g., deeming a signatory non-compliant). This remains highly improbable.  
6. Status quo: The count already meets the threshold, and the situation is stable.

Probability: 98%
Predicted Probability: 98.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Space.com (Dec. 12, 2024): Samantha Mathewson reports Panama and Austria became the 49th and 50th signatories on Dec. 11, 2024. High-quality, draws on NASA press releases and direct quotes from Bill Nelson; factual reporting.  
• SpaceNews (Jan. 22, 2025): Jeff Foust reports Finland as the 53rd signatory on Jan. 21, 2025, sourcing NASA and Finnish space authority statements. Reputable industry journal, clear sourcing.  
• OpenTools.ai article (May 15, 2025): “Welcome, Norway!” reports Norway’s signing as the 55th on May 15, 2025, citing NASA and Norwegian Space Agency. Credible, though secondary aggregator.  
• Cambridge Core (American Journal of International Law): Background on the Accords’ legal principles and diplomatic context. Authoritative academic source but no new count data.  
• Perplexity summary (May 2025): Aggregates timeline of signings up to 55. Useful corroboration but treated as tertiary.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts)  
  • Direct count data: 55 signatories already recorded as of May 15, 2025 (SpaceNews/OpenTools).  
  • No historical withdrawals from the Artemis Accords or analogous non-binding space treaties.  
  • Institutional inertia: once countries publicly commit, reversals are extremely rare.  
Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)  
  • Ongoing geopolitical tensions (e.g., U.S.–China) could theoretically prompt withdrawal, but China never joined, and major space rivals have remained observers.  
  • NASA/state-department emphasis on stability and diplomacy through the next administration.  
Weak evidence (small shifts)  
  • Reporting lags: if a package of signatures were mis-recorded—but counts are cross-checked by multiple outlets.  
  • Domestic political shifts in a single member state unlikely to trigger withdrawal given reputational costs.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
  • Today is May 16, 2025; resolution on July 1, 2025 (47 days away).  
  • With 47 days left, reversals would require formal notification by a signatory of its withdrawal or a clerical de-listing. Both are unprecedented and need diplomatic processes ≥ months.  
  • If timeframe were halved (≈23 days), probability of reversal remains effectively unchanged (still near zero). If doubled (≈94 days), same reasoning applies—no precedent for reversal in that span.  

(d) Justification  
1. Baseline (“outside view”): Once a countable threshold of signatories is met well before deadline, analogous treaties do not lose members. Base-rate probability of retention ≈ 99.9%.  
2. Current factors (inside view):  
   – Threshold already met (55 on May 15, 2025).  
   – Zero historical withdrawals.  
   – Cross-verified by multiple reliable sources.  
   – Political incentives strongly favor maintaining or increasing membership, not withdrawal.  
3. Risks:  
   – Extremely unlikely diplomatic spats could prompt a withdrawal by a minor participant, but the process requires formal steps and public notice, which would be reported widely.  
4. Adjustment:  
   – Trim base-rate slightly (from 99.9% to 99%) to allow for unprecedented events (e.g., a sudden policy reversal in one signatory).  

Probability calibration  
My inside-view probability reflects near certainty, with a small (<1%) allowance for unprecedented diplomatic reversal or reporting error.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will there be at least 55 Artemis Accords signatories on July 1, 2025?” (Threshold already met on May 15, 2025).  
2. Outside view base rate: Threshold-exceeded outcomes very rarely reverse (≈0%).  
3. Consistency: “99 out of 100 times, once a voluntary international agreement reaches a recorded threshold well before deadline, it remains at or above that level.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 55 signatories recorded (May 15, 2025).  
   • No historical withdrawals.  
   • Multiple independent, reliable sources confirming count.  
5. Blind spot: A surprise mass-withdrawal from an emerging power triggered by political crisis; still needs formal process and would be reported.  
6. Status quo: Membership counts in voluntary space treaties are stable; status quo strongly favors “Yes.”

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Space.com 12 Dec 2024 – reports Panama (#49) and Austria (#50) signings. Straight factual event coverage, corroborated elsewhere; high reliability; no material opinion except celebratory quotes.  
2. SpaceNews 12 Dec 2024 – identical facts plus context, quotes from NASA/State Dept.; trade publication with strong record; high reliability.  
3. Space.com living article (rolling update, consulted 16 May 2025) – states “55 nations as of 15 May 2025.” Factual tally, but single-author maintained page; treat as moderately reliable.  
4. SpaceNews 15 May 2025 – reports Norway signing, explicitly calling it the 55th accession. Includes NASA press-release reference; high reliability; key datum.  
5. “OpenTools.ai” blog post on Norway (#55) – repeats NASA information; unknown outlet, use only as secondary corroboration; moderate reliability.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Independent confirmation (SpaceNews + NASA press release) that Norway became signatory #55 on 15 May 2025.  
• Four-year historical record: 0 withdrawals from any of the now-55 signatories.  
• Institutional incentive: Accords are non-binding, reputationally positive; withdrawal would carry diplomatic cost, providing structural stickiness.  

Moderate evidence  
• Growth momentum: 3 new accessions in first 4.5 months of 2025 → ~0.7 mo⁻¹; Poisson expectation ≈1 additional accession before 1 Jul.  
• Statements from State Dept. officials (Littlejohn, Vikmanis) expecting continued sign-ups through Administration change.  

Weak evidence  
• Speculation that an incoming U.S. administration might scale back Artemis and dampen enthusiasm (mentioned by a single analyst).  
• Chinese/Russian diplomatic pressure against the Accords (periodic commentary) – no sign it has induced any withdrawal to date.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until resolution: 46.  
If timeframe were halved (23 d): withdrawal probability slightly lower still; probability of additional sign-ups also lower but irrelevant—count already ≥55. Net probability would rise about +1 pp.  
If timeframe doubled (92 d): small increase in chance of an unprecedented withdrawal and larger chance of additional accessions. Net probability would fall perhaps −1 pp. Overall sensitivity low.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base (current count ≥55 → 95%).  
− Withdrawal risk: Empirical frequency <0.01/yr · 55 states · 0.125 yr ≈0.07% → round to 1 % to acknowledge model & reporting uncertainties → 94%.  
+ Chance of clerical mis-count corrected downward to 54 judged <1% (all signings announced by NASA and deposited with U.S. State Dept.).  
+ Probability of new signatories before 1 Jul (≈60%) cannot hurt the “Yes” outcome, adds small cushion (+2 pp).  

Resulting inside view ≈97%.  
No single presently visible factor plausibly knocks two or more countries out within six weeks; even one withdrawal is historically unprecedented.  

Probability calibration
Range of reasonable beliefs among informed watchers: 92–99%. My median: 97 %.  A ±10 pp shift would imply believing either multiple imminent withdrawals (dropping to 87 %) or perfect certainty in bureaucratic counts (up to 107 % impossible). Hence 97 % reflects remaining tail-risks without overconfidence.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will there be at least 55 Artemis-Accords signatories on 1 Jul 2025?”  
2. Base rate: after Norway, status quo already satisfies criterion → 95 %.  
3. Consistency: “In 97 of 100 comparable worlds, the tally is ≥55 on 1 Jul 2025.”  
4. Key evidence  
   • Norway became #55 on 15 May 2025 (NASA/SpaceNews).  
   • Zero withdrawals since launch.  
   • Only 46 days left.  
   • Accords are non-binding & reputationally valuable.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden geopolitical incident (e.g., U.S. cancels Artemis, triggering coordinated protest withdrawals). Probability judged <3 %.  
6. Status-quo: Already met; inertia favours “Yes”.

Probability: 97%
Predicted Probability: 97.0%...
