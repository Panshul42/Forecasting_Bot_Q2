Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether the US will lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2 by July 1, 2025 is understanding precedents for both imposing and rescinding Russian energy–related sanctions, the legislative authorities (e.g., CAATSA, executive orders), and the geopolitical and domestic political pressures that have driven previous adjustments. Relevant history includes U.S. sanctions on pipelines and energy firms post-2014, the use of waivers or exceptions under CAATSA, and debates over sanction relief for energy projects (e.g., TurkStream, Iran’s pipelines). We also need to track evolving EU reliance on Russian gas and bipartisan attitudes in Congress toward sanctions relief. This background provides a base-rate view of how often—and under what conditions—sanctions on Russian energy assets have been lifted.

Analysis:
The key question is whether the US removes Nord Stream 2 AG from the OFAC SDN list by July 1, 2025. Historically, US sanctions on Russian energy projects have been persistent absent major shifts in Russia–Ukraine dynamics or a strong Europe‐US compromise. The recent Politico report (April 23, 2025) indicates internal White House debate, but congressional resistance—especially among Republicans demanding tougher stances on Russia—and allied energy security concerns could block any delisting. To form an inside view, we need the latest on:  
• White House and Treasury deliberations on lifting or modifying sanctions  
• Statements from Biden administration officials (State, Treasury, Energy)  
• Congressional actions or pressures (bills, hearings, floor speeches)  
• European partners’ diplomatic pushes or objections  
• Russian reactions or offers tied to pipeline operation

Disclaimer: Content extraction appears incomplete beyond the description of NS-MBS List designations. Summary reflects available text only.

1. Context and Scope  
- Since July 2014, the U.S., EU, and like-minded partners have imposed sanctions, export controls, and price caps on Russian energy (oil, gas, minerals/mining, nuclear) to curtail Kremlin revenue while avoiding major global price shocks.  
- U.S. measures have steadily escalated over nine years; the EU imposed minimal 2014 sanctions, then expanded them sharply after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

2. 2014–2022 U.S. and EU Measures  
- July 2014: U.S. and EU banned exports of critical technologies/equipment for Russian deepwater, Arctic, and shale oil projects; U.S. later extended this ban to any venture (inside or outside Russia) with ≥33% participation by a sanctioned entity.  
- These measures targeted future production capabilities, not existing onshore oil wells.  
- U.S. and EU remained divided on sanctions against Russian gas pipelines supplying Europe:  
   • Nord Stream 1 (NS1) had operated since 2010; EU approval for Nord Stream 2 (NS2) came in 2011, officially launched in 2015, but construction stalled until 2018 amid legal objections and unclear U.S. policy.

3. Mixed U.S. Policy on Nord Stream 2  
- U.S. enacted CAATSA and PEESA sanctions but repeatedly issued waivers and amendments, at times halting and at times permitting NS2 construction.  
- February 2021: Russia resumed pipe-laying. The U.S. responded by sanctioning several laying vessels yet granted waivers to Nord Stream 2 AG (the project’s parent company) and CEO Matthias Warnig—reflecting the tension between condemning Russia and maintaining transatlantic ties.  
- Germany, a strong NS2 backer, criticized U.S. overreach but shifted stance in November 2021 when its regulator suspended NS2 certification, citing lack of an “independent transmission operator,” and halted operations pending corporate restructuring.

4. Post-February 2022 Invasion Measures  
- The U.S. joined 45 allies in deploying sanctions, tariffs, export controls, and price caps targeting Russian natural gas, crude/refined oil, nuclear materials, metals/mining, and related financial services.  
- Objectives: degrade Russia’s ability to fund aggression while preserving global energy availability.  
- Policy constraints:  
   • Further sanctions risk global energy shocks and burdens on U.S. consumers and allies.  
   • After 2014, major Russian energy designations tapered off by 2017, suggesting reluctance to fully isolate key suppliers.

5. Sanction Designations to Date  
- Since 2022, only Gazprom has been elevated from a 2014 Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) listing to the Non-SDN Menu-Based Sanctions (NS-MBS) List—entailing non-blocking prohibitions on certain goods/services.  
- Other 2014-listed entities remain at the SSI threshold.

6. Implications and Outlook  
- U.S. policy toward Nord Stream 2 has oscillated between sanctioning entities and granting waivers to maintain alliance cohesion.  
- EU internal divisions (e.g., Germany’s initial NS2 support vs. later suspension) have gradually aligned more with U.S. positions, particularly after the 2022 invasion.  
- Future shifts in U.S./EU energy sanctions will balance pressure on Russian revenues against risks of global market disruption.

<Summary source="https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2022/09/shock-and-awe-who-attacked-the-nord-stream-pipelines">
Here is a concise summary of the Carnegie Endowment article “Shock and Awe: Who Attacked the Nord Stream Pipelines?” focusing on facts, data, and sourced opinions:

1. Incident overview  
• On September 26, 2022, three leaks appeared on Nord Stream 1 (both lines) and Nord Stream 2 (one line) beneath the Baltic Sea, off Denmark and Sweden.  
• Seismologists in Denmark and Sweden estimate explosions equivalent to ~100 kg of TNT at each site.  

2. Environmental and economic impact  
• An estimated 500 million m³ of natural gas was released—roughly 8 million t of CO₂ equivalent, or 1/5000 of annual global CO₂ emissions.  
• Gas leakage poses little local hazard but raises methane-climate concerns.  
• Repairs (pumping out water, clearing debris, restoring internal coatings) could take under a year and cost “hundreds of millions, maybe billions”—a small share of Gazprom’s annual budget.  

3. Sanctions and repair logistics  
• Nord Stream AG (a Swiss firm) is not under U.S. sanctions and can draw on Norway’s Equinor-led Pool for repair equipment.  
• Nord Stream 2 is under U.S. sanctions; its pipelaying used only Russian vessels. Germany halted its commissioning in February 2022.  
• Any subsea work in Danish waters requires a Danish permit; although the sanctions regime allows environmental-safety waivers, these are deemed unlikely while the Ukraine war continues.  

4. Attribution and possible culprits  
• No formal Western finding of responsibility yet; evidence may be declassified.  
• International Energy Agency director Fatih Birol: “It is very obvious (…) who was behind this issue.” (September 29, 2022)  
• NATO and the EU have also hinted at state-level sabotage.  
• Given the scale and simultaneity of three blasts, sabotage is regarded as certain; non-state actors are considered highly unlikely.  
• Hypothesized delivery methods include depth charges from ship/aircraft, delayed-charge explosives placed by divers or submarine, or a modified pipeline-inspection “pig.”  

5. Political reactions and signaling  
• Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova (state source) blamed “countries … completely controlled by U.S. intelligence services.”  
• Fox News’s Tucker Carlson (less reliable/unofficial source) suggested a U.S. role: “If you are Vladimir Putin, you would have to be a suicidal moron to blow up your own energy pipeline.”  
• Western governments—already on edge after Putin’s September 21 nuclear-threat address—are treating the blasts as a strategic warning.  
• Europe’s immediate gas supplies weren’t affected: Nord Stream 1 had paused in early September; Nord Stream 2 was never commissioned and was losing commercial value as Europe sought non-Russian gas.  

6. Strategic and commercial implications  
• If Russia were responsible, the attack could signal a threat to other offshore energy infrastructure (e.g., Norway-to-Europe pipelines), especially as it coincided with the Baltic Pipe inauguration.  
• Gazprom may gain: with Nord Stream 1 physically disabled, it can claim force majeure to limit compensation for undelivered gas.  

No definitive public attribution has been made; formal responsibility and motives remain under investigation.

<Summary source="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57180674">
Here’s a concise extraction of the key points from the BBC’s May 20, 2021 report on the Biden administration’s waiver of sanctions related to Nord Stream 2:

1. Facts and figures  
- Nord Stream 2 is a roughly $11 billion (£7.8 billion) gas pipeline running from the Russian Arctic under the Baltic Sea to Germany.  
- Construction was reported to be “more than 95% complete.”  
- The U.S. Department of State delivered a report to Congress noting that Nord Stream 2 AG and its CEO, Matthias Warnig, had engaged in sanctionable activity but recommending a waiver as “in the U.S. national interest.”  
- Sanctions were also imposed on four Russian-flagged ships involved in laying the pipeline.

2. U.S. executive-branch positions  
- President Joe Biden has publicly opposed the project.  
- Secretary of State Antony Blinken (during his confirmation hearing) said he was “determined to do whatever we can to prevent” the pipeline’s completion.  

3. International reactions from named, reliable sources  
- Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov: While noting “serious differences,” said U.S. and Russia should still cooperate where interests align.  
- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov: Called the waiver reports “a positive signal.”  
- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov (via state-run TASS): Welcomed “a chance for a gradual transition toward the normalization of our bilateral ties.”  
- German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas: Described the waiver as “a constructive step,” underscoring Germany’s importance as a U.S. partner.  
- Yuriy Vitrenko, CEO of Ukraine’s state energy firm Naftogaz: Called Nord Stream 2 Russia’s most “dangerous geopolitical project” and said Kyiv would lobby for sanctions to halt it.

4. U.S. Congressional reactions from named, reliable sources  
- Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: Criticized the waiver, urged the administration to impose “congressionally mandated sanctions.”  
- Senator Jim Risch (R-ID), ranking Republican on that committee: Called the waiver “a gift to Putin” that undermines U.S. leverage ahead of a possible Biden-Putin summit.  
- Representative Michael McCaul (R-TX), top House Republican on foreign affairs: Warned that finishing the pipeline would deepen Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, leave Ukraine more vulnerable, and enrich the Kremlin.

5. Political and strategic context  
- Biden campaigned on not “rolling over” to Russia, yet analysts suggested he was willing to risk domestic criticism to avoid a rupture with Germany.  
- The waiver follows recent U.S.-Russia tensions over a major pipeline cyber-attack and contrasts with Biden’s earlier cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline in the name of climate policy.

Here’s a summary of the AA.com.tr article:

• Marco Rubio’s denial (reliable, named source)  
  – On X, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called a Politico report that the Trump administration is weighing lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2 “unequivocally false.”  
  – He stated that neither he nor special envoy Steve Witkoff have had any conversations about lifting those sanctions as part of a Ukraine peace deal.  
  – Rubio described the story as “journalistic malpractice” and demanded a full retraction.

• Politico’s claims (based on unnamed sources; less reliable)  
  – Reported that the White House was debating lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and other Russian energy assets in Europe.  
  – Alleged that Steve Witkoff was the main proponent and had instructed his team to compile a list of all energy sanctions on Russia.  
  – Quoted unnamed insiders saying the idea “has not found much traction” in the White House and that Rubio actively opposed it.

• Pipeline background (objective facts)  
  – Nord Stream is a network of offshore natural-gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea, running from Russia to Germany.  
  – Nord Stream 1 has operated since 2011. Nord Stream 2 was completed in 2021 but never went into service due to U.S. sanctions first imposed in 2019 (Trump) and maintained after the 2022 Ukraine invasion (Biden).

• Context  
  – The denial comes amid broader discussions about a potential normalization of U.S.-Russia relations.

<Summary source="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486">
Below is a summary of the April 23, 2025 POLITICO article “White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream,” with key facts and attributions.  

• Debate context  
  – The White House is weighing lifting U.S. sanctions on Nord Stream 2 (and possibly other Russian energy assets in Europe) as part of peace‐talk discussions to end the Russia–Ukraine war (five people familiar with the discussions).  
  – Sanctions on Nord Stream 2 were first imposed under Trump, waived by Biden in 2021, then reimposed after Russia’s 2022 invasion.  

• Strategic and economic considerations  
  – Restarting Nord Stream 2 would only financially benefit Moscow if the EU agreed to resume purchases—unlikely given EU efforts to reduce reliance on Russian energy.  
  – Lifting sanctions would be a “diplomatic coup for Russia and a major concession from Trump” (POLITICO).  
  – U.S. LNG exporters (e.g., Cheniere Energy) fear renewed Russian supply would depress global gas prices and undercut U.S. sales (Laurent Ruseckas, S&P Global Commodity Insights).  
  – Restored Russian gas exports into Europe would “reduce the appetite of potential buyers of U.S. LNG” (Ruseckas).  

• Key players  
  – Steve Witkoff (White House special envoy): leading proponent of easing energy sanctions; has a personal rapport with Putin; tasked his team with cataloging U.S. energy‐related sanctions on Russia.  
  – Marco Rubio (Secretary of State) and Witkoff jointly issued a statement calling the Politico report “false” and “totally fictitious and irresponsible,” demanding retraction.  
  – Interior Secretary Doug Burgum (chair of the White House Energy Dominance Council): opposed; aligned with U.S. energy export interests.  
  – Opponents argue Witkoff has been misled about U.S. economic upside by Russia, and that restoring Russian exports would be “a bloodbath for American [oil and gas] producers” (unnamed U.S. official).  

• Recent developments & related projects  
  – Nord Stream 2 status: one of two pipelines still intact after a September 2022 explosion (linked in reports to Ukrainian nationals); investigations ongoing.  
  – Arctic 2 LNG project: U.S. sanctions currently block up to 13.2 million tons/year of potential Russian LNG exports.  
  – Peace‐talk package (London): reportedly included U.S. recognition of Russia’s 2014 Crimea annexation and sanctions relief—terms Ukraine rejected.  
  – European Commission considering a ban on new Russian oil and gas contracts.  

• External lobbying efforts (less–documented)  
  – Stephen Lynch (Monte Valley Partners): seeking a U.S. Treasury license to acquire Nord Stream 2; purchased other former Russian energy assets.  
  – Matthias Warnig (under U.S. sanctions, former spy and Putin associate): pursuing a separate pipeline‐restart deal with U.S. investors and outreach to the Trump circle.  

• Business climate notes  
  – U.S. oil & gas firms have gained European market share post‐2022 but face headwinds from U.S. trade/tariff policies (e.g., steel tariffs) and opaque administration trade strategy.

<Summary source="https://www.kyivpost.com/post/51418">
Here’s a summary of the Kyiv Post article as reported by Politico (April 25, 2025):

• Politico report, citing five unnamed White House insiders, says the Trump administration is considering lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and other Russian energy assets as part of peace‐talks with Ukraine.  
• According to those sources, Trump’s special envoy to Russia, Steve Witkoff, is spearheading the effort and has ordered a complete inventory of U.S. energy sanctions on Russia.  
• In an official White House press release, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff both “vehemently deny” any such discussions happened. They label the Politico story “false” and call Politico “a fifth-rate publication,” demanding a full retraction.  
• One source told Politico the idea lacks broad White House support: Rubio has actively blocked it, and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum (who chairs the White House Energy Dominance Council) also opposes easing energy sanctions.  
• Internal debate framed as “energy dominance” (Burgum, favoring U.S. LNG markets) versus rapprochement with Russia (Witkoff). Critics note that restarting Nord Stream 2 would only benefit Moscow if the EU resumes buying Russian gas—unlikely given the EU’s push to reduce Russian imports—but would nonetheless be a major diplomatic win for Russia.  
• Earlier in April, Trump extended existing Russia-related energy sanctions for another year by executive order—a policy originally put in place by President Biden.  

Source notes: Politico’s account rests on anonymous insiders; the denials come from a joint Rubio–Witkoff press statement.

# US Sanctions on Russian Energy Infrastructure: Imposition, Lifting, and Policy Debates  

The United States has employed sanctions as a key tool to counter Russian energy projects deemed detrimental to geopolitical stability, with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline serving as a focal point for legislative action, diplomatic tensions, and shifts in presidential administrations. This report examines the historical application and removal of sanctions on Russian energy infrastructure, emphasizing legal frameworks, political dynamics, and outcomes.  

## Early Sanctions and the Nord Stream 2 Debate (2017–2020)  

### Legislative Foundations: CAATSA and NDAA  
The **Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)**, enacted in 2017 under President Donald Trump, mandated sanctions on entities investing in Russian energy export pipelines[5][15]. This law targeted projects like Nord Stream 2, a $11 billion natural gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, which bypassed Ukraine[9][12]. CAATSA required congressional notification for sanctions relief, constraining executive flexibility[5][15].  

In December 2020, Congress passed the **National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)**, expanding sanctions to include vessels and insurers involved in Nord Stream 2’s construction[12]. Despite bipartisan support, President Trump vetoed the bill, citing economic concerns, but Congress overrode the veto in January 2021[12].  

### Political Tensions: US-Europe Divergence  
Germany defended Nord Stream 2 as a commercial project, while the US and Eastern European allies argued it would deepen Europe’s energy dependence on Russia and undermine Ukraine’s transit role[3][9]. The Trump administration framed sanctions as a measure to protect European security, but Germany accused the US of undermining its sovereignty[9][13].  

## Biden Administration: Sanctions Waiver and Reimposition (2021–2024)  

### May 2021 Sanctions Waiver  
In May 2021, President Joe Biden waived sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG (the pipeline operator) and its CEO Matthias Warnig, a Putin ally, despite their designation under CAATSA[2][9]. The State Department justified the move by noting the pipeline was 95% complete and arguing that sanctions would strain US-German relations[9][13]. Biden stated, “Imposing sanctions did not seem to make any sense” given the project’s advanced stage[9][13].  

The waiver faced bipartisan criticism. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) called it a “gift to Putin,” while Republicans accused Biden of undermining Ukraine[2][9]. Ukraine’s Naftogaz CEO Yuriy Vitrenko labeled the pipeline a “dangerous geopolitical project”[2][9].  

### February 2022 Sanctions Reimposition  
Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden reversed course, imposing blocking sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers on February 23, 2022[3][9]. Germany concurrently halted certification, effectively killing the project[3][13]. State Department spokesman Ned Price declared the pipeline “a hunk of steel at the bottom of the sea”[3]. These measures were paired with sanctions on Russian banks, oligarchs, and energy firms like Gazprom and Rosneft[3][7].  

## Trump Administration’s 2025 Sanctions and Reversal Debates  

### January 2025 Escalation  
In January 2025, the outgoing Biden administration imposed its most stringent sanctions yet, targeting:  
- **Gazprom Neft** and **Surgutneftegas**, Russia’s third- and fourth-largest oil producers[1][4].  
- A “shadow fleet” of 183 oil tankers evading the G7 price cap[1][16].  
- Russian maritime insurers and LNG projects like Arctic LNG 2[1][7].  
- A Chinese oil terminal facilitating sanctioned vessels[1].  

These measures revoked **General License 8**, which had permitted energy-related transactions through March 12, 2025[4][16]. The sanctions aimed to reduce Russia’s oil exports by 0.5–1 million barrels per day[1].  

### March 2025: Trump’s Potential Reversal  
Upon taking office, the Trump administration debated lifting sanctions to expedite a Ukraine peace deal. Key figures included:  
- **Steve Witkoff**, Trump’s envoy to Moscow, who advocated lifting Nord Stream 2 sanctions to restart gas flows[10][11][18].  
- Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who opposed concessions, fearing economic losses for US LNG exporters[11][18].  

In April 2025, Trump lifted sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and Arctic LNG 2, arguing it would incentivize Russian cooperation[18]. Critics warned this would restore Russia’s energy leverage over Europe[11][14].  

## Legal and Political Constraints on Sanctions Relief  

### CAATSA’s Congressional Review Mechanism  
CAATSA required presidents to submit reports to Congress before easing sanctions, subject to a 30-day review period[5][15]. Joint resolutions of disapproval could block relief, though Trump’s 2025 actions relied on executive authority, bypassing CAATSA by citing national security interests[5][15].  

### Energy Market Considerations  
Sanctions waivers often reflected concerns over global oil prices. The Biden administration initially exempted energy transactions with Sberbank and VTB Bank to stabilize markets[16]. Trump’s 2025 reversal risked undercutting the G7 price cap, which had limited Russian oil revenues to $60/barrel[14][16].  

## Case Study: Nord Stream 2’s Geopolitical Impact  

### US-German Negotiations (2021)  
In July 2021, the US and Germany agreed to complete Nord Stream 2 in exchange for a $1 billion Green Fund for Ukraine and German commitments to counteract Russian coercion[9][13]. The deal failed to address Eastern European concerns, with Poland and Ukraine calling it a “defeat”[9].  

### Post-2022 Sabotage and Aftermath  
In September 2022, explosions damaged three of Nord Stream 2’s four pipelines, halting operations indefinitely[9]. Investigations implicated pro-Ukrainian actors, but the incident solidified the pipeline’s non-operational status[11][18].  

## Conclusion: Patterns in US Sanctions Policy  

US sanctions on Russian energy infrastructure have oscillated between containment and pragmatism, shaped by:  
1. **Transatlantic Relations**: Waivers often aimed to preserve alliances (e.g., Biden’s 2021 waiver for Germany)[9][13].  
2. **Domestic Politics**: Bipartisan pressure forced tougher measures (e.g., NDAA 2021 override)[12].  
3. **Energy Security**: Exemptions for oil/gas transactions sought to balance market stability and punitive goals[16].  
4. **Strategic Flexibility**: Executive actions, particularly under Trump, prioritized deal-making over legislative constraints[5][18].  

The Nord Stream 2 saga underscores the tension between economic statecraft and geopolitical realities, with sanctions remaining a double-edged sword in US-Russia relations.

Here are the key points from the New York Times article “New U.S. Sanctions Target Russian Company Behind Lucrative Pipeline” (Feb. 24, 2022):

1. Context & Action  
  • President Biden announced sanctions on the company building Nord Stream 2—the undersea gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany—hours before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began.  
  • This reversed his earlier waiver of pipeline sanctions.  

2. Targets & Scale  
  • Sanctions hit a Gazprom subsidiary responsible for Nord Stream 2.  
  • Administration officials call the project an “$11 billion prize investment” now “a hunk of steel sitting at the bottom of the sea.” (State Department spokesman Ned Price)  

3. Triggering Event  
  • German Chancellor Olaf Scholz suspended the pipeline’s certification after Russia sent troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. (Officials cite Scholz’s move as the opening to impose U.S. pipeline sanctions.)  

4. Broader Sanctions Framework  
  • Part of a coordinated NATO/EU package: U.S. also sanctioned two Russian banks and elites; the EU sanctioned Russia’s defense minister, Putin’s chief of staff, and prominent media figures.  
  • The White House warned further measures would follow if Russia escalated. (Jen Psaki, White House press secretary)  

5. U.S. Political Reactions  
  • Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) lifted holds on 17 Biden nominees once sanctions were announced—he’d blocked them until pipeline penalties were imposed.  
  • Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) praised the move as “an important first step” but urged tougher financial and export-control measures.  

6. Administration Rationale & Warnings  
  • Biden’s team initially hesitated because Nord Stream 2 was ~90–99% complete when he took office. (“The idea that anything … was going to stop it is not possible,” Biden, 2021.)  
  • Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh argued blocking the pipeline curtails Russia’s “geostrategic chokehold over Europe” and helps energy independence.  

7. Follow-Up Coordination  
  • Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman conferred with European counterparts to align sanctions.  

Sources & Reliability  
  • Official U.S. statements: Biden, Jen Psaki, Ned Price, Daleep Singh, Antony Blinken, Wendy Sherman.  
  • German response: Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s suspension of certification.  
  • Congressional voices: Senators Ted Cruz and Rob Portman.

President Joe Biden announced on 23 February 2022 that the United States would join Germany in imposing sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project in response to Russia’s mounting military pressure on Ukraine. Key points from the Euractiv article:

1. Sanctions details  
   • Targets: Nord Stream 2 AG (the pipeline’s operator) and its corporate officers.  
   • Announced in tandem with other recent US/EU measures against two Russian banks and several oligarchs.

2. Project status and background  
   • Nord Stream 2 is fully built under the Baltic Sea but has never entered operation.  
   • Total investment: approximately $11 billion.  
   • At the time Biden took office, it was reported to be over 90 percent complete.  

3. German actions  
   • Germany halted the pipeline’s certification process after Russia recognized the breakaway Donbas regions in eastern Ukraine.  
   • Berlin said it would reevaluate the certification procedure in light of those moves.

4. Strategic considerations  
   • Proponents view the pipeline as an efficient means to supply Russian gas directly to Germany, bypassing Ukraine.  
   • Critics argue it would increase Russia’s leverage over EU energy security and undermine Ukraine.  

5. Administration rationale and commentary  
   • Biden statement: “I have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers.”  
   • State Department spokesman Ned Price: “By acting together with the Germans how we did, when we did, and the way in which we did, we have ensured that this … $11 billion investment … is now a hunk of steel, sitting at the bottom of the sea.”  
   • Biden praised Germany as “a leader” on the issue and warned of further steps “if Russia continues to escalate.”  
   • He added that President Putin’s actions provide “an overwhelming incentive to move away from Russian gas and to other forms of energy.”

6. Potential short-term impacts  
   • Risk that Russia might use energy supplies to pressure Europe’s already stressed markets.  
   • Possible upward pressure on fuel prices in the United States, exacerbating domestic inflation concerns facing the Biden administration.

Here is a concise summary of the February 24, 2022 New York Times article by Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Edward Wong:

• Context and timing  
  – President Biden announced the sanctions just hours before Russia launched its full-scale military operation in Ukraine.  
  – Administration officials had warned for days that a Russian assault was imminent.

• Sanctions on Nord Stream 2-related entity  
  – Biden imposed economic sanctions on the pipeline’s operator, a Gazprom subsidiary known as “Nord Stream 2 AG.”  
  – This marked a reversal of his 2021 decision to waive sanctions on the project despite bipartisan calls to halt it.

• Triggering event  
  – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s decision (on February 23) to suspend certification of the pipeline—after Russia recognized two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine—spurred the U.S. move.

• Biden’s stated rationale (quote)  
  “These steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine,” Mr. Biden said. “As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate.”

• Allied measures  
  – NATO partners described the action as part of a unified effort to deter further Russian aggression.  
  – The European Union simultaneously announced sanctions on Russia’s defense minister, President Putin’s chief of staff, and prominent figures in the Russian media.

• Other U.S. sanctions earlier that week  
  – On February 22, the administration sanctioned two Russian banks and several elites.  
  – It also cut off Russia’s access to Western financing markets.  
  – Officials warned that still tougher measures could follow if Russia attempts to seize more Ukrainian territory or the entire country.

Here is a concise extraction of the key points from the May 25, 2021 CNN article by Caroline Kelly and Jason Hoffman. No additional material has been added.

1. Facts and context  
   • Nord Stream 2 is a nearly completed Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline, expected to finish summer 2021, designed to supply Europe with gas via the Baltic Sea.  
   • By bypassing Ukraine, the pipeline would deprive Kyiv of transit-fee revenue and give Russia more direct market access.

2. Biden’s stated rationale (named, highly reliable source)  
   – “I have been opposed to Nord Stream 2 from the beginning,” President Biden said, but “it was almost completed by the time I took office.”  
   – He argued that imposing sanctions now “would… be counterproductive in terms of our European relations” and could damage U.S.-German ties on broader security issues.

3. Internal deliberations (unnamed sources, less directly attributable)  
   • One U.S. official “familiar with the process” told CNN the State Department prepared an assessment of what action would have been required to halt the pipeline but concluded the blow to the U.S.-Germany relationship wasn’t worth it.  
   • A second source “familiar with the situation” said the ultimate decision not to sanction was made by the White House.

4. Political and geopolitical reactions  
   • Some Democratic lawmakers oppose Nord Stream 2 and may be further strained by Biden’s decision.  
   • In Congress, opponents view the move as a win for President Vladimir Putin—potentially increasing Russia’s leverage over Eastern Europe.  
   • Ukrainian officials were expected to be “infuriated,” since the pipeline would bypass Ukraine and cut off critical transit fees.

5. Reporting note  
   • CNN attributes the first report of the administration’s decision to Axios.

Here are the key takeaways from the February 17, 2021 NBC News article “Lawmakers want Biden administration to update Congress on sanctions against Russian gas pipeline”:

Facts and procedural details  
• A bipartisan group of four House members sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking for a briefing on U.S. plans to enforce sanctions against the Russia-to-Germany “Nord Stream 2” pipeline.  
• Under legislation passed in January 2021 (over President Trump’s veto), the administration was required to report to Congress by February 16, 2021, on which companies involved in the pipeline should be sanctioned. That report was not delivered.  
• Letter signatories:  
  – Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), ranking Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee  
  – Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL)  
  – Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH)  
  – Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ)  
• The State Department declined to comment on internal communications with Congress.  
• Nord Stream 2 would double Russia-to-Germany natural gas capacity, helping Germany shift away from coal and nuclear power.

Named opinions from reliable sources  
• “If completed, Nord Stream 2 would enable the Putin regime to further weaponize Russia’s energy resources to exert political pressure throughout Europe,” wrote the four lawmakers in their letter.  
• German Chancellor Angela Merkel has consistently maintained that the pipeline is a “purely commercial matter” and should not be tied to geopolitics or human-rights concerns.  
• According to documents posted by Environmental Action Germany, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz proposed to then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that the U.S. hold off on enforcing sanctions.

Less-reliable or unattributed views  
• The article references “reports that companies have resumed work on the project in apparent breach of the U.S. sanctions,” but does not name the companies or cite a specific source for this claim.

Here are the relevant news articles:

**Trump Suggests Those Responsible for Nord Stream Sabotage, Refuses to Conduct Costly Investigation**
US President Trump stated that he has information about those responsible for the sabotage of the 'Nord Stream' gas pipelines and does not believe a costly investigation is necessary to uncover the details. Trump shared his thoughts at a press conference in the White House, saying, 'If I ask certain people, I can tell you who blew up the pipelines without spending a lot of money on an investigation.' Trump's comments sparked a wide resonance in both the US and Europe, where discussions about the circumstances of the incident continue. Additionally, Trump reiterated that Russia is not involved in the sabotage, despite Western speculation to the contrary. The explosions on the two Russian export gas pipelines, 'Nord Stream' and 'Nord Stream-2', occurred on September 26, 2022, and raised serious concerns about European energy security. Currently, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden are also considering the possibility of a targeted sabotage as one of the likely causes of the incident. The situation surrounding the pipeline sabotage remains extremely tense, and Trump's statements have added fuel to the international political debate. Trump did not reveal specific details, but his confidence in possessing the necessary information highlights the complexity and importance of the situation in the context of global energy connections. Some analysts note that such certainty in accusations from the US President may be used by various parties for speculation on the international stage. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a special operation in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, citing the need to protect the residents of Donbass. He stated that Russia had no other choice. The West condemned Moscow's actions, deciding to support Kyiv with financial aid and arms. In this context, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized that the geographical tasks of the special operation in Ukraine have changed and will not be completed within the territories of Donbass alone. Europe remains convinced that sanctions can stop the Russians, and as a result, it bears losses and destructive effects from its own decisions on its economy. Law-abiding citizens in Europe do not understand why prices are rising in stores and fuel is becoming more expensive, and why the Kyiv authorities are not willing to compromise to sit down at the negotiating table with the Kremlin.

**Germany Warns of Possible New Attack on Nord Stream 2**
Ralf Niemayer, head of the German Council for the Constitution and Sovereignty, believes that another attack on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is possible. 'From a technical standpoint, it can be done at any moment. And last time it was a military operation, not just a couple of divers swimming in on a boat. A similar military operation is always possible,' Niemayer told RIA Novosti. He added that nationalizing the German part of Nord Stream 2 could help protect the pipeline, as any new diversion would be considered an act of aggression against Germany. The White House has been discussing lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and other Russian assets in Europe as part of Ukraine negotiations.

**Trump: Many People Know Who Blew Up Nord Stream Pipelines**
Donald Trump stated that many people know who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines. The US President emphasized that he was the first to 'blow up' the Baltic pipelines by imposing sanctions on them. Trump said, 'I think many people know who did it.' He also added, 'But if I asked certain people, I could tell you (about this) without wasting a lot of money on an investigation.' Trump was responding to a question about whether he plans to launch an investigation into the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines. The President also stated that he was the first to 'blow up' the project because 'he did not allow it to be built.' He was referring to the sanctions imposed on Nord Stream during his first presidential term (2017-21). Trump also mentioned that the falling oil prices, which have reached $55 per barrel, put the US in a 'good position' to end the war in Ukraine. 'Russia wants to settle, Ukraine wants to settle, and if I weren't president, no one would settle,' Trump said. He also referred to Russian President Putin's proposal to suspend hostilities for three days to commemorate the anniversary of the end of World War II, saying, 'It doesn't sound like much, but it's a lot when you know where we started from.'

**Trump Promises to Reveal Those Responsible for Nord Stream Explosions**
The United States has expressed concern over the incidents on the 'Nord Stream 1' and 'Nord Stream 2' gas pipelines. President Donald Trump stated that he knows who is responsible for the explosions and is willing to reveal their names, but did not provide any specific information. Trump denied the accusations made against Russia. During a press conference at the White House, Trump said: 'If I asked some people, I could name the names of those responsible without a lot of investigation costs. It seems that many already know who did it.' Meanwhile, Life.ru reminded that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently dismissed rumors about the planned lifting of sanctions on 'Nord Stream 2'. Experts believe that Trump may use the situation around 'Nord Streams' in negotiations with Moscow. Almost three years have passed since the mysterious incidents on 'Nord Streams' on September 26, 2022. European countries have launched their own investigations, but their results have not been presented to Russia despite repeated official requests. After the incident, a 'Ukrainian diver' was among the suspects. Russian President Vladimir Putin accuses US special services of organizing the sabotage, believing that European countries know the truth but prefer to hide it. Denmark has granted Nord Stream 2 AG permission to conserve the damaged section of 'Nord Stream 2' in the Baltic Sea. The restoration of the pipeline requires significant financial investments, estimated at 633 million euros.

**US Considers New Sanctions Against Russia Amid Ongoing Ukraine Conflict**
The US is considering new sanctions against Russia, according to unnamed American officials. The goal is to pressure President Vladimir Putin to support US efforts to end the war in Ukraine. However, it is unclear whether President Donald Trump will ultimately approve these measures, which would affect 'Gazprom' and other major Russian energy companies, as reported by Reuters. The agency suggests that Trump may approve the sanctions, as his sympathy for Russia's stance has given way to disappointment due to Putin's disregard for his calls for a ceasefire and peace talks. A bipartisan coalition of 72 senators, led by Republican Lindsey Graham, has introduced a bill that includes specific measures, such as a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy energy resources from Russia. Graham claims that these secondary sanctions 'will crush' the Russian economy. Western analysts believe that the Trump administration is undergoing an 'anti-Russian turn'. This is evident in the recent resignation of Mike Waltz as national security advisor, which will now be combined with the role of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is known for his hawkish views and has opposed a proposal by US Special Envoy Stephen Witting to lift sanctions on 'Nord Stream 2'. According to Reuters, the new sanctions are 'content-free from an economic perspective, but made with a clear political intent and have their own internal logic', says Nikita Maslennikov, a leading expert at the Center for Political Technologies. 'I think the White House and Trump's team are trying to balance the initiative of 72 American senators to make the picture more comprehensive: not only lawmakers are determined to put serious pressure on Moscow, but we, people directly in the administration, are also doing so. This is also a signal to Trump's critics in the US, who accuse the president of being soft on Russia.' However, since these 'leaks' are extremely vague, it appears that the content of the sanctions package is still far from being finalized. For now, it can only be described as a tool for external pressure and manipulation. If the sanctions are eventually implemented, what would be the consequences for Russia and the global economy? 'Today, the whole world, including the US, is on the brink of a new global crisis, the probability of which is not decreasing. These restrictions will only push it forward, becoming one of the links in the chain of destructive events. Although Reuters mentions the Russian banking sector, it is likely that the sanctions will target secondary sanctions, pressure on banking mechanisms of countries that have close trade and economic ties with Moscow. The result will be the complication of calculations, prolongation of payment transaction terms, and increase of companies' costs. By the way, American sanctions providing for a 500% tariff on imports from countries buying Russian raw materials will be no less destructive for global markets.'

**Donald Trump: 'Many people know who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines'**
US President Donald Trump stated on Monday that 'many people know who blew up the Nord Stream pipelines.' He also claimed that he was the first to 'blow up' the Baltic pipeline network by imposing sanctions on it. An investigation is ongoing into the destruction of the infrastructure at the beginning of the war in Ukraine. According to reports, German investigators suspect that a group of Ukrainians, led by former Ukrainian army chief General Valeriy Zaluzhny, was responsible for the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The investigations in Denmark and Sweden have been closed, and the evidence has been handed over to Germany, where the investigation is still ongoing. Trump expressed his conviction that many people know who is behind the destruction of the pipelines. He also stated that he could have obtained this information without conducting a costly investigation. Trump reminded that he was the first to 'blow up' the Nord Stream project by imposing sanctions on it during his presidency from 2017 to 2021. He emphasized that he did not allow the construction of the pipelines, which had a significant impact on their future. Trump also commented on the proposal by Russian President Vladimir Putin to suspend hostilities for three days. Trump considered this a significant step, despite it being a short period. The proposal from the Kremlin was related to the anniversary of the end of World War II.

**US Considers New Sanctions Against Russia Amid Ongoing Ukraine Conflict**
The US is considering new sanctions against Russia, according to unnamed American officials. The goal is to pressure President Vladimir Putin to support US efforts to end the war in Ukraine. However, it is unclear whether President Donald Trump will ultimately approve these measures, which would affect 'Gazprom' and other major Russian energy companies, as reported by Reuters. The agency suggests that Trump may approve the sanctions, as his sympathy for Russia's stance has given way to disappointment due to Putin's disregard for his calls for a ceasefire and peace talks. A bipartisan coalition of 72 senators, led by Republican Lindsey Graham, has introduced a bill that includes specific measures, such as a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy energy resources from Russia. Graham claims that these secondary sanctions 'will crush' the Russian economy. Western analysts believe that the Trump administration is undergoing an 'anti-Russian turn'. This is evident in the recent resignation of Mike Waltz as national security advisor, which will now be combined with the role of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is known for his hawkish views and has opposed a proposal by US Special Envoy Stephen Witting to lift sanctions on 'Nord Stream 2'. According to Reuters, the new sanctions are 'content-free from an economic perspective, but made with a clear political intent and have their own internal logic', says Nikita Maslennikov, a leading expert at the Center for Political Technologies. 'I think the White House and Trump's team are trying to balance the initiative of 72 American senators to make the picture more comprehensive: not only lawmakers are determined to put serious pressure on Moscow, but we, people directly in the administration, are also doing so. This is also a signal to Trump's critics in the US, who accuse the president of being soft on Russia.' However, since these 'leaks' are extremely vague, it appears that the content of the sanctions package is still far from being finalized. For now, it can only be described as a tool for external pressure and manipulation. If the sanctions are eventually implemented, what would be the consequences for Russia and the global economy? 'Today, the whole world, including the US, is on the brink of a new global crisis, the probability of which is not decreasing. These restrictions will only push it forward, becoming one of the links in the chain of destructive events. Although Reuters mentions the Russian banking sector, it is likely that the sanctions will target secondary sanctions, pressure on banking mechanisms of countries that have close trade and economic ties with Moscow. The result will be the complication of calculations, prolongation of payment transaction terms, and increase of companies' costs. By the way, American sanctions providing for a 500% tariff on imports from countries buying Russian raw materials will be no less destructive for global markets.'

**Nord Stream 2 AG Loses Case Against Sparkasse Vorpommern**
The Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of the Russian Gazprom-Konzern, has lost its case against the Sparkasse Vorpommern in a German court. The court ruled that the Sparkasse was justified in canceling the company's bank accounts, citing the risk of secondary sanctions under US law. The Nord Stream 2 AG had opened the accounts to allow the German government to purchase pipeline segments without restrictions. However, the pipeline was never used for gas imports after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and one of the pipeline's strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022. The court's decision was upheld in a second instance, with the Rostocker Oberlandesgericht ruling that the Nord Stream 2 AG's appeal had 'no prospect of success'.

**White House Debates Lifting Sanctions on 'Nord Stream 2' Pipeline**
The White House is reportedly debating whether to lift sanctions on the 'Nord Stream 2' pipeline and other Russian assets in Europe. According to US News and World Report, five sources familiar with the matter say that the White House is considering lifting sanctions as part of a discussion to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. However, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Special Envoy for Middle East Robert Malley have denied the report on social media platform X. Sources say that Malley has been a key supporter of lifting sanctions on Russia, and has instructed his team to draft a list of all US energy sanctions on Russia. One source said, 'It's not a done deal, it's not a cake that's about to be served.' Despite Malley's efforts, the idea has not gained much support in the White House, and Blinken has tried to block it. Other opponents include US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who is also the head of the White House Energy Dominance Committee. According to S&P Global Commodity Insights Executive Director Laurent Ruseckas, allowing Russia to resume natural gas transportation through 'Nord Stream 2' or 'Arctic 2' would lower global natural gas prices and put US liquefied natural gas exporters such as Cheniere Energy at a disadvantage. Ruseckas said, 'If Russian gas returns to the market, it will reduce the appetite of potential US liquefied natural gas buyers.'

**US Considers Reopening Nord Stream 2 Project Amid Debate**
The White House has been embarrassed by the Nord Stream scandal. After revelations by Politico, the US administration had to deny having any views on the underwater gas pipelines, which connect Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. According to Politico, which cited five reliable sources close to the matter, the White House was considering reopening the Nord Stream 2 project. A debate on this issue had emerged between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff, a special envoy of Donald Trump for Ukraine. Witkoff reportedly asked his team to make a list of all energy-related sanctions imposed on Russia to determine whether to lift them, as stated in Politico. According to the American news site, Witkoff is the main advocate for lifting the sanctions. A restart of Nord Stream, whose infrastructure is still usable despite the 2022 sabotage, is now in the balance, pending an agreement from the German government.

**US debates lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2  --  Politico**
The United States is debating whether to lift sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and potentially other Russian assets in Europe, according to Politico. Lifting the sanctions would be 'a sharp reversal' by the administration of US President Donald Trump, who imposed the sanctions during his first term. White House special envoy Steve Witkoff is in favor of lifting the sanctions, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum are opposed to the idea.

**White House Considers Lifting Sanctions on Nord Stream 2**
The White House is considering lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and other Russian assets in Europe as part of negotiations over Ukraine, according to Politico. 'The White House is discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline and possibly other Russian assets in Europe as part of discussions on ending the war between Russia and Ukraine,' the article states. However, sources say that Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff is in the minority on this issue, with many others opposing the idea, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US Secretary of the Interior Doug Bergman. Bergman, who wants to open up markets for American LNG, and Wietkoff, who wants to improve relations with Russia, are at odds over the issue, according to one source. The debate is taking place among those who dominate the energy sector. 'Bergman, who wants to open up markets for American LNG, and Wietkoff, who wants to improve relations with Russia,' said the source. The concerns and disagreements over Nord Stream 2 are understandable, as Russia's return as the main energy supplier to Europe would be a 'bloodbath' for American energy producers. The article notes that Trump, who criticized the Russian project, claimed credit for its 'destruction.' If the US were to lift sanctions on the pipeline, it would be a significant concession to Moscow from Trump. In this context, German journalists have pointed out that there are still over 1,000 pipes from Nord Stream 1 and 2 companies stored in the industrial park in Lubmin, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which could be used for possible future repairs to the Baltic pipelines. Meanwhile, Serbian President Alexander Vucic predicted last year that the Nord Stream pipeline would be launched within a year, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has already stated that Russia is ready to supply gas to Europe through the surviving Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Germany is the only country blocking the process.

**US Officials Debate Lifting Restrictions on Nord Stream 2**
Senior officials in the US government are debating the initiative to lift restrictions on the Russian gas pipeline 'Nord Stream 2'. According to Politico, citing insiders, the debate is between those who hold dominant positions in energy policy. 'There are internal debates in the White House between people who hold dominant positions in energy...', Politico reported. The main proponent of lifting sanctions on Russian assets is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, Stephen Whitlock. However, he is now opposed by the head of the US Department of the Interior, Douglas Bergam. The debate centers on the US government's choice between competing on the European energy market and restoring relations with Russia. Experts had previously predicted that the 'Nord Stream 2' issue would become a bargaining chip for President Donald Trump in negotiating a Ukraine crisis agreement.

**White House Considers Lifting Sanctions on 'Nord Stream 2' Gas Pipeline**
The White House is discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the 'Nord Stream 2' gas pipeline and other Russian assets in Europe as part of negotiations over Ukraine, according to Politico, citing sources. This would be a significant change in US policy, Politico notes, and would be a major concession from President Joe Biden. 'The White House is discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Russian 'Nord Stream 2' gas pipeline and other Russian assets in Europe as part of discussions on ending the war between Russia and Ukraine,' Politico reports, citing sources. Special envoy Steve Wietkoff is reportedly the main proponent of lifting the sanctions, but his idea has not yet gained much traction in the White House, Politico notes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has tried to block the idea, and Interior Minister Doug Bergam has also opposed it, according to the publication. 'There are internal debates in the White House between people in dominant positions in energy, Bergam, who wants to get markets for American LNG, and Wietkoff, who wants to reconcile with Russia,' a source told Politico. The source also warned that a return to Russia as the main energy supplier in Europe would be a 'bloody bath' for American energy producers.

**White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream**
The White House is debating lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, including Nord Stream 2, which could provide a financial windfall to Moscow. However, this move would be seen as a diplomatic coup for Russia and a major concession from the Trump administration. Steve Witkoff, the White House special envoy to Moscow, has been the main proponent of lifting sanctions, but his idea has not found much traction in the White House. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are among those opposed to the idea, citing concerns that it would harm American oil and gas producers. 'This is not a cake in the oven being baked, though the ingredients are being assembled,' said one person familiar with the debate. The U.S. natural gas industry has made inroads into Europe, but companies are now reeling from the administration's trade war and tariffs on imported steel. Multiple outsiders, including Stephen Lynch and Matthias Warnig, are lobbying the administration to lift the sanctions.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

### CNAS Report on Russian Energy Sanctions
This appears to be from the Center for a New American Security, a reputable think tank. It provides factual historical context on the evolution of U.S. and EU sanctions on Russian energy since 2014. Key factual points include the oscillation of U.S. policy on Nord Stream 2 between sanctioning entities and granting waivers, and Germany's shifting position from supporting NS2 to later suspending certification in November 2021. The analysis is largely fact-based with minimal opinionated content.

### Carnegie Endowment Article on Nord Stream Pipeline Sabotage
From a respected policy think tank, this source provides factual reporting about the September 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. It details the environmental and economic impact, noting that repairs are technically possible but politically complicated due to sanctions regimes. The article clearly attributes opinions to named sources (like IEA director Fatih Birol) while maintaining factual reporting about the incident itself.

### BBC Article (May 2021)
A highly reliable source reporting on the Biden administration's waiver of sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG in May 2021. The article clearly separates facts from official positions, noting that Biden waived sanctions despite publicly opposing the project. It captures diverse political reactions from named officials, including Russian, German, Ukrainian, and U.S. congressional perspectives.

### AA.com.tr Article
This report from Turkey's state news agency covers Secretary of State Marco Rubio's denial of Politico's reporting about lifting NS2 sanctions. While generally reliable, it primarily reports on the denial itself rather than independently verifying claims. The key factual content is Rubio's on-the-record denial, calling the Politico report "unequivocally false."

### Politico Article (April 23, 2025)
This report claims the Trump administration is debating lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, including Nord Stream 2. It relies heavily on unnamed sources ("five people familiar with discussions"), which reduces reliability. It reports that Steve Witkoff is leading the effort while Secretary Rubio opposes it. The article includes factual context about the pipeline's status but its central claims about internal debates are harder to verify given the reliance on anonymous sources and the official denial.

### Kyiv Post Article
Essentially a repackaging of the Politico report with no substantial new information. As a Ukrainian outlet, it may have inherent biases on Russia-related issues. The article adds no independently verified facts beyond repeating the Politico reporting and the official denials.

### Perplexity Report
This AI-generated report provides a comprehensive overview of U.S. sanctions on Russian energy infrastructure, drawing from multiple sources. It offers useful factual context, noting CAATSA requirements for congressional notification before lifting sanctions and detailing the timeline of sanctions decisions. While generally factual with clear attribution, it should be treated with appropriate skepticism as an AI-generated synthesis.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several potential reference classes are relevant:

1. **Previous Nord Stream 2 sanctions decisions**: The U.S. has imposed (2019 under Trump), waived (May 2021 under Biden), and reimposed (February 2022 under Biden) sanctions on Nord Stream 2. This pattern suggests significant policy volatility.

2. **Congressional-Executive tensions on Russia sanctions**: CAATSA imposed constraints on the executive branch's ability to unilaterally lift sanctions, requiring congressional notification.

3. **Late presidential term policy changes**: With the resolution date being shortly after a presidential transition, historical patterns of foreign policy shifts in new administrations are relevant.

The most suitable reference class is previous Nord Stream 2 sanctions decisions, as it directly addresses the same entity and similar political dynamics. This class shows that policies have changed multiple times, often following major geopolitical developments or administration changes.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

From today (May 6, 2025) to the resolution date (July 1, 2025) is approximately 8 weeks.

This is a relatively short window for implementing a major sanctions policy change, especially considering:
- CAATSA requires congressional notification for lifting sanctions, which introduces procedural delays
- The timing falls within the early period of a new presidential administration, when policy implementation can be slower
- Previous sanctions changes (both imposing and lifting) typically had longer lead times

The short timeframe significantly constrains the probability of a completed sanctions-lifting process, even if the administration were committed to such a change.

## (d) Justification:

Several key factors inform my outside view prediction:

1. **Status quo bias**: Nord Stream 2 AG is currently sanctioned. The default outcome if no action is taken is for it to remain on the SDN list, making "No" the baseline prediction.

2. **Physical pipeline damage**: The September 2022 sabotage damaged parts of the Nord Stream system, reducing the immediate practical value of lifting sanctions since repairs would still be needed.

3. **Procedural hurdles**: CAATSA requires congressional notification for lifting sanctions, which introduces delays and political complications in the 8-week window before resolution.

4. **Political contradictions**: The reported internal debate in the Trump administration is directly contradicted by Secretary Rubio's firm denial, creating significant uncertainty about the administration's true intentions.

5. **Historical pattern**: While sanctions policy has changed before, these changes have typically followed major geopolitical shifts or new administrations taking office, rather than occurring in short windows without clear catalysts.

6. **Geopolitical context**: With the Ukraine conflict apparently ongoing, lifting sanctions would represent a major concession to Russia that might face significant domestic political opposition.

## Outside View Calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I need to consider several probability components:

- The probability that the administration is actively considering lifting sanctions (despite denials): ~30-40% based on the conflicting reporting vs. official denial
- If considering it, the probability they decide to proceed: ~30-40% given likely congressional opposition
- If they decide to proceed, the probability they complete the process before July 1: ~50-60% given the short timeframe and procedural requirements

Multiplying these conditional probabilities suggests a range of 4.5-9.6%. 

I need to account for the fact that "No" is the status quo position, requiring no action to maintain, while "Yes" requires specific, affirmative policy changes in a limited timeframe.

## Outside View Prediction:
8%

The low probability reflects the combination of procedural hurdles, the short timeframe, official denials of policy changes, physical damage to the pipeline reducing practical motivations, and the status quo bias toward maintaining existing sanctions. While policy shifts are possible, the specific constraints surrounding this question make a sanctions lift by July 1, 2025 unlikely.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **CNAS Report on Russian Energy Sanctions**
   - Provides historical context of US/EU sanctions on Russian energy from 2014-2022
   - Details evolution of policy on Nord Stream 2, noting inconsistent US approach with waivers and amendments
   - High-quality source from a reputable think tank with factual information about sanctions policy
   - Limited by being focused on pre-2022 events rather than current circumstances

2. **Carnegie Endowment Article on Nord Stream Attack**
   - Documents the September 2022 sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines with technical details
   - Estimates repair costs at "hundreds of millions, maybe billions" and timeframe of under a year
   - Reliable source with factual information on the physical state of the pipelines
   - Relevant for understanding the physical constraints but dated (2022)

3. **BBC Article on Biden's 2021 Waiver**
   - Reports Biden's waiver of sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and CEO in May 2021
   - Includes official statements from US, Russian, German, and Ukrainian officials
   - High-quality reporting from a reliable news source
   - Provides valuable precedent for sanctions waiver but outdated for current prediction

4. **AA.com.tr Article on US Denial**
   - Reports Secretary of State Marco Rubio's denial of Politico report about lifting sanctions
   - Includes official statement calling the report "unequivocally false"
   - Factual reporting of official statements, though limited in scope
   - Recent and directly relevant to current sanctions stance

5. **Politico Article on White House Debates**
   - Claims White House is weighing lifting sanctions as part of peace talks (April 23, 2025)
   - Attributes information to "five people familiar with the discussions" (unnamed sources)
   - Notes Steve Witkoff as leading proponent and opposition from Burgum and Rubio
   - Contains assertions that have been officially denied, reducing reliability

6. **Kyiv Post Article**
   - Largely summarizes the Politico reporting with few additional details
   - Notes Trump extended Russia sanctions in April 2025
   - Secondary source relying heavily on contested Politico reporting
   - Limited independent factual content

7. **Perplexity Report**
   - Comprehensive overview of US sanctions history on Russian energy
   - Includes timeline of legislation, waivers, and reimposition patterns
   - Contains some unverified claims about Trump lifting sanctions in April 2025
   - Useful for understanding legal/procedural context, but contains some assertions contradicting other sources

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Relevant reference classes include:

1. **Previous US sanctions decisions on Nord Stream 2 specifically**
   - Biden waived sanctions in May 2021, then reimposed them in February 2022 after Russia's invasion
   - Shows sanctions can be reversed based on geopolitical developments
   - **High suitability**: Directly addresses the same entity and policy question

2. **Trump administration's approach to sanctions relief**
   - Current administration appears divided on Russia policy
   - Trump has historically favored deal-making approaches
   - **Moderate suitability**: Relevant for current decision-makers but lacks specificity to Nord Stream 2

3. **Sanctions relief as part of peace negotiations**
   - Sanctions relief commonly serves as a negotiating tool in international diplomacy
   - **Moderate suitability**: Relevant if peace talks are occurring, but uncertain timeframe

4. **Legislative constraints on sanctions relief**
   - CAATSA requires congressional notification and review periods
   - **High suitability**: Procedural constraints directly impact feasibility within timeframe

The most suitable reference class combines elements of #1 and #4: previous sanctions decisions on Nord Stream 2 within the context of legislative procedural requirements.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question asks about sanctions status by July 1, 2025, approximately 8 weeks from the current date (May 6, 2025).

Historical patterns suggest:
- Biden's 2021 waiver took significant time for deliberation before implementation
- CAATSA's congressional review mechanism requires a 30-day notice period
- Major sanctions changes typically align with significant geopolitical developments

The short timeframe is a substantial constraint:
- Even if the administration began the process immediately, legislative requirements would consume much of the available time
- The reported internal disagreement would need resolution rapidly
- According to Kyiv Post, Trump extended Russia-related sanctions in April 2025, suggesting no immediate plans for reversal

## (d) Justification

Several factors make lifting sanctions by July 1, 2025 unlikely:

1. **Official denials**: Secretary Rubio and envoy Witkoff have formally denied considering sanctions relief on Nord Stream 2, directly contradicting reports suggesting otherwise.

2. **Procedural constraints**: CAATSA requires congressional notification and a 30-day review period, which would consume most of the remaining time even if initiated immediately.

3. **Internal opposition**: Reports suggest Interior Secretary Burgum and other administration officials oppose lifting sanctions, creating a barrier to quick action.

4. **Limited practical value**: One pipeline remains intact after the 2022 sabotage, but restoration would only benefit Russia if the EU resumed purchases, which is unlikely given Europe's push to reduce Russian energy dependence.

5. **Recent policy action**: Trump reportedly extended Russia sanctions in April 2025, suggesting no immediate reversal plans.

6. **Domestic opposition**: Previous sanctions relief (Biden's 2021 waiver) faced bipartisan criticism; similar opposition would likely emerge, complicating rapid implementation.

7. **U.S. energy interests**: American LNG exporters have gained European market share and would oppose reestablishing Russian competition.

While there is precedent for sanctions relief (Biden's 2021 waiver), that occurred under different circumstances with a longer implementation timeline. The current denied reports, combined with the short timeframe and multiple obstacles, make sanctions relief by July 1 improbable.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I need to weigh the evidence systematically:

- The most current factual information is the official denial by Secretary Rubio and special envoy Witkoff that sanctions relief is being considered
- Previous sanctions changes took months to implement, and we have only 8 weeks remaining
- CAATSA's congressional review mechanism alone would consume most of the available time
- The physical damage to the pipeline and EU policy reduce incentives for quick action
- Even if the administration secretly intends to lift sanctions (despite denials), the procedural and political hurdles make completion by July 1 highly unlikely

Given the official denials, procedural constraints, and short timeframe, I assess a very low probability that sanctions will be lifted by July 1. However, I cannot completely rule it out given reported internal discussions and Trump's deal-making tendencies.

## Outside View Prediction:
12%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. CNAS report (“Sanctions by the Numbers…”):  Reliable think-tank overview of U.S./EU energy sanctions on Russia since 2014.  Data-rich on sanction designations (SSI, NS-MBS, blocking), limited on relief instances.  Factual.  
2. Carnegie Endowment (“Shock and Awe…”):  Academic analysis of the 2022 Nord Stream blasts.  Focus is sabotage attribution/environmental impact—no direct sanction-relief data.  Factual with sourced expert commentary.  
3. BBC (May 20, 2021):  Mainstream media report on Biden’s waiver of Nord Stream 2 AG sanctions.  High reliability; clearly distinguishes facts (waiver) from official opinions.  
4. AA.com.tr (“US rejects…considering lifting sanctions”):  News agency summary of Marco Rubio’s denial of a Politico report.  Mix of reliable quotes (Rubio) and less-reliable unnamed-source claims.  Opinions flagged.  
5. Politico (April 23, 2025):  Detailed Washington‐Insider report on internal White House debates over lifting energy sanctions.  Reliable attribution to five anonymous sources, balanced by official denials from Rubio/Witkoff.  
6. Kyiv Post summary of Politico (April 25, 2025):  Secondary retelling of the same Politico story with identical strengths/weaknesses.  
7. Perplexity report:  Aggregated historical narrative on U.S. sanctions on Russian energy.  High volume of detail but heterogeneous sourcing; good starting point but requires vetting.  

Across sources, the only clear historical “lift” of Nord Stream 2–related sanctions is Biden’s May 2021 waiver—limited in scope, quickly reversed in 2022.  No other major Russian energy sanction has been rescinded swiftly.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
• All U.S. sanctions on Russian energy firms/pipelines (2014–2025).  Few relief events; mostly tightening.  
• Major U.S. sanctions on strategic infrastructure globally (e.g., Iran nuclear sanctions).  Relief commonly tied to broad diplomatic agreements, multi-year processes.  
• Short-term reversals of sanctions by U.S. presidents (<12 months after imposition).  Rare, usually limited waivers, seldom permanent removals.  

The most suitable class is “U.S. sanctions on Russian energy infrastructure.”  Within 2014–2025, out of dozens of designations only one partial waiver occurred, and it proved transient.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until the question’s cutoff is ~56 days.  Historically, any sanction relief under CAATSA or PEESA triggers a 30-day Congressional review plus interagency coordination, requiring more than two months.  Sanction relief tied to diplomatic deals (e.g., Iran JCPOA) took years.  Quick relief (<3 months) is effectively unprecedented for a Russian energy asset.

(d) Justification for outside view  
- Political constraints: Bipartisan support remains for punishing Russia over Ukraine; any relaxation would provoke strong opposition in Congress and among U.S. LNG exporters.  
- Legal barriers: CAATSA’s mandatory notification and review period alone (~30 days) leaves limited runway for an executive removal before July 1.  
- Historical frequency: Only one narrow waiver in 2021; no full delisting of Nord Stream 2 AG in over four years.  
- Current signals: April 2025 reports indicate internal debate but equally strong denials by senior officials; no credible movement toward formal action.  
- Time pressure: Only two months remain for the full regulatory and political process necessary to delist Nord Stream 2 AG.  

Taken together, the outside-view base rate for lifting such sanctions in this window is very low.

Outside view calibration:  
Given one narrow, temporary waiver in eight years versus dozens of sanctions actions, plus the time needed for CAATSA review and political clearance, I estimate the baseline probability at about 5%.  Small changes—a sudden diplomatic breakthrough or a peace deal—could shift odds, but as of early May 2025 those appear unlikely.

Outside View Prediction:

- Politico (Apr 23, 2025): Politico’s scoop that the White House is debating lifting NS 2 sanctions. Based on five anonymous insiders, opposed by identifiable officials. Facts vs. anonymous claims are clearly separated; medium quality but requires caution on unverified leaks.  
- Kyiv Post summary (Apr 25, 2025): Repeats the Politico story and joint Rubio–Witkoff denial. Same caveats as Politico; secondary sourcing.  
- Perplexity report (“Past instances where the U.S. imposed and lifted sanctions on Russian energy…”): Aggregated from many sources. It correctly traces CAATSA and NDAA cycles, Biden’s 2021 waiver and 2022 reimposition, and Trump’s early-2025 debate. Quality varies by citation; mix of fact and some Model-generated synthesis. Use factual legal timelines with caution on model‐inferred judgments.

2. Reference-class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
  a. Major U.S. sanctions on Russian energy entities (2014–2025) and their subsequent reversals.  
  b. U.S. use of CAATSA pipeline sanctions and frequency of waivers/reversals.  
  c. Short-term (≤3 months) reversals of high-profile U.S. sanctions under an incumbent administration.  
Suitability: (c) is the narrowest and most directly comparable—how often has the U.S. lifted or waived a major energy‐sector sanction within a two- to three-month window of reimposition? Very rarely (only Biden’s May 2021 Nord Stream 2 waiver came ~4 months after Congress imposed new penalties; other reversals typically took longer or followed regime change). Thus reference class (c) is most apt.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: ~56 days (from May 6 to July 1, 2025). Historical pattern: quick reversals of major sanctions within two months are nearly unprecedented, especially when sanctions are renewed by executive order with explicit end dates (e.g., Biden’s March 2025 extension to March 2026). Even under administrations eager to re-engage, CAATSA’s 30-day congressional review and political pushback delay action beyond 2 months.

4. Justification  
- Status quo: Nord Stream 2 AG is on OFAC’s SDN list as of May 2025, under a March 2025 executive order extending energy sanctions to March 2026.  
- Political dynamics: While Trump-appointed special envoy Witkoff is pushing for a lift, key cabinet figures (Rubio, Burgum) vocally oppose it. Joint denials suggest the idea lacks White House consensus.  
- Domestic constraints: CAATSA’s congressional notification requirement and potential for joint resolutions of disapproval make a rapid reversal politically fraught.  
- Alliance factors: Germany and the EU have moved to decouple from NS 2 post-invasion, making a U.S. lift diplomatically hollow and potentially unpopular among NATO partners.  
- Reference-class baseline: Under reference class (c), short-term sanction lifts of this magnitude are almost zero. Even a robust inside view debate bumps probability slightly above zero, but friction is high.  

Outside view calibration:  
- Base‐rate probability for major energy-sector sanction reversal within two months: near 0%.  
- Adjust for active internal debate and new administration’s ideological leanings: +5 percentage points max.  
- Adjust for strong public denials, legal constraints, and lack of EU pressure: –2 percentage points.  

Calibrated outside view probability: ~3%.

Outside View Prediction:  
I estimate a 3% chance that the U.S. will have lifted Nord Stream 2 sanctions by July 1, 2025.

Analysis:
A. Source analysis  
• CNAS “Sanctions by the Numbers” (think-tank, 2024).  Factual tally of U.S. energy-sector sanctions, legal authorities, waiver episodes.  Credible; contains few opinions and those are attributed to named analysts.  
• Carnegie Endowment “Shock and Awe” (2022).  Describes September-2022 pipeline explosions and legal implications for repair work.  Factual chronology; opinions limited to attribution hypotheses, all sourced.  
• BBC (20 May 2021).  Straight news on Biden’s waiver of sanctions.  Well-sourced quotes from U.S., German and Ukrainian officials; minimal speculation.  
• Anadolu Agency (26 Apr 2025).  Rubio/Witkoff denial of Politico story.  Factual statements from named officials; story itself cites an anonymously-sourced Politico claim—so quality of “lifting sanctions” rumour is low.  
• Politico (23 Apr 2025).  Five unnamed insiders say the White House is “debating” lifting Nord Stream 2 sanctions.  Politico is reputable but anonymity lowers weight; note immediate on-record denial.  
• Kyiv Post (25 Apr 2025).  Secondary reporting of the Politico piece plus the Rubio/Witkoff denial.  Adds no independent facts.  
• Perplexity report (LLM-compiled, Apr 2025).  Collates public information on past sanction lifts.  Useful descriptive statistics but not primary evidence; treat cautiously.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes and observed base rates (2014-2024):  
1. All Russian entities added to the SDN List that were subsequently removed within 1 year → 2/271 ≈ 0.7 %.  
2. Russian energy-infrastructure companies removed from SDN List while the Russo-Ukrainian war was active (2014-…): 0/14 ≈ 0 %.  
3. Any SDN delistings that occurred in the final six months of a U.S. presidential term without a signed peace agreement: 3/116 ≈ 2.6 % (mostly Sudan, Myanmar cases).  

Reference class 2 is closest in substance (same sector, same war context) and yields a base rate essentially ~0 %.  Class 3 shows that late-term reversals are rare but not impossible.  I choose class 2, then widen uncertainty with class 3.

C. Timeframe analysis  
Today-to-deadline = 56 days.  In OFAC practice, delisting of a high-profile entity usually takes 30-90 days from the start of an inter-agency process, including notice to Congress (CAATSA §216) and Federal Register publication.  There is no publicly visible process underway; Rubio publicly denied any.  Even if the White House decided tomorrow, the bureaucratic runway is now tight.  Historically, only 1 of 49 Russia-related delistings (mainly deceased individuals) was completed in <60 days.

D. Justification for the outside-view probability  
• Status quo bias: entity is sanctioned, the war continues, bipartisan support for Russia sanctions remains high.  
• Institutional friction: CAATSA review clock and coordination with State, Treasury, Congress make a sub-two-month delisting unusually difficult.  
• Political optics: Lifting sanctions on a pipeline partly blown up, still non-operational, and strongly opposed by U.S. LNG lobby would attract heavy criticism in an election year; no peace treaty in sight.  
• Competing signals: Only thin anonymous sourcing (Politico) points toward a change; on-record denials by principal actors (Rubio, Witkoff) point the other way.  Outside view discounts insider rumour.  
• Blend of base rates: start with 0.7 % (class 1) → adjust up for (i) slight precedent of Biden’s 2021 waiver, (ii) presidential willingness to make headline concessions, (iii) small probability that an existing but unseen delisting process is already 30 days in.  Those factors roughly triple the base rate → ~2 %.  Adjust down 20 % relative (to 1.6 %) for the compressed 56-day window.  Round to nearest tenth of a percent for clarity.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: 0–3 % range from reference classes.  
Upward adjustments: past single waiver (2021) +1 pp; possibility of hidden negotiations +0.5 pp.  
Downward adjustments: bureaucratic timeline −0.5 pp; sustained bipartisan opposition −0.4 pp.  
Result ≈ 1.6 %.  Given model uncertainty, widen by ±0.7 pp → 0.9 %–2.3 %.  Mid-point 1.6 % is my calibrated outside-view estimate.

Outside View Prediction:
I assign a 2 % probability that the United States will lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 (i.e., Nord Stream 2 AG will not appear on the SDN List) by 1 July 2025.

Final predictions: [11.0, 10.0, 10.0, 5.0, 3.0]
Result: 7.0

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

### Historical Context Sources (2021-2022)
1. **New York Times articles (Feb 2022)** - Reliable mainstream source confirming Biden imposed sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG as Russia began its Ukraine invasion, after previously waiving them. Contains factual reporting on official decisions with clear attribution.

2. **Baker McKenzie Blog (Feb 2022)** - Legal/professional source providing specific details on OFAC's addition of Nord Stream 2 AG to the SDN list and the limited wind-down license. Highly reliable for technical sanctions details.

3. **Euractiv article (Feb 2022)** - EU-focused news source corroborating the NYT reporting with additional European perspective. Contains factual information about the Biden administration's actions.

4. **CNN article (May 2021)** - Reports on Biden's earlier decision to waive sanctions despite opposing the pipeline. Contains both factual reporting of decisions and opinions from unnamed sources regarding internal deliberations.

5. **NBC News article (Feb 2021)** - Reports on bipartisan congressional pressure regarding Nord Stream 2 sanctions. Documents factual information about congressional communications.

### Current News Articles (April-May 2025)
1. **POLITICO article (April 23, 2025)** - Reports internal White House debates about lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, including Nord Stream 2. Cites five unnamed people familiar with discussions. Reports Special Envoy Steve Witkoff supports lifting sanctions while Secretary of State Marco Rubio opposes. Key original source that many other articles reference.

2. **Various Russian/East European sources (May 2025)** - Multiple outlets (Tsargrad TV, Rambler, Mail.Ru, TVN24, etc.) reference the Politico reporting while adding Trump's recent comments about the Nord Stream sabotage. These add limited new factual information beyond Trump's public statements.

3. **Multiple sources note Secretary Rubio's denial** - Several articles mention that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has publicly denied the Politico report about planned lifting of sanctions, calling it "unequivocally false."

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

### Strong Evidence
1. **Current sanctions status and timeframe** - Nord Stream 2 AG is currently on the SDN list, with less than 8 weeks until the resolution date. Removing an entity from the SDN list requires a formal administrative process with potential congressional notification requirements under CAATSA.

2. **Secretary Rubio's explicit denial** - The current Secretary of State has publicly rejected reports about plans to lift sanctions. As the cabinet official with primary responsibility for sanctions implementation, this represents a significant official position contrary to sanctions relief.

3. **Physical damage to pipeline infrastructure** - Multiple sources confirm the September 2022 sabotage damaged the Nord Stream pipelines. This reduces the immediate practical benefit of lifting sanctions since the pipeline would still require repairs to be operational.

### Moderate Evidence
1. **Internal administration debate** - Politico's reporting (citing five unnamed sources) indicates internal discussions about potentially lifting sanctions, with divided opinions among officials. While unconfirmed officially, the detail and specificity suggest some level of consideration.

2. **Historical pattern of policy volatility** - The historical record shows US policy on Nord Stream 2 sanctions has shifted multiple times (imposed under Trump, waived then reimposed under Biden), demonstrating that sanctions positions can change based on geopolitical developments.

3. **Trump's focus on Ukraine settlement** - Recent statements indicate President Trump is actively engaged in seeking an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Lifting energy sanctions could potentially be part of broader negotiations, though no direct connection has been established.

### Weak Evidence
1. **Private-sector interest** - One article mentions former Nord Stream 2 director Matthias Warnig working with US investors on reviving the pipeline, suggesting potential commercial pressure for sanctions relief.

2. **European Commission disinterest** - A claim that the European Commission is not interested in restoring the pipeline's operation could complicate US efforts to coordinate sanctions relief with allies.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The timeframe is approximately 8 weeks from today (May 6, 2025) to the resolution date (July 1, 2025).

This is a relatively short period for implementing a significant sanctions policy change, considering:
- The formal administrative process for removing an entity from the SDN list
- CAATSA requirements for congressional notification before lifting certain Russia-related sanctions
- The need for interagency coordination and potentially international consultation

If the timeframe were halved (4 weeks), the probability would decrease substantially (perhaps to 3-5%) as the procedural constraints would become even more limiting.

If the timeframe were doubled (16 weeks), the probability might increase moderately (perhaps to 15-20%) as it would allow more time for the administrative process and potential diplomatic negotiations.

## (d) Justification:

The most compelling factors affecting the likelihood of sanctions being lifted before July 1, 2025 are:

1. **Status quo bias** - Nord Stream 2 AG is currently sanctioned, and maintaining this status requires no action. Lifting sanctions requires affirmative steps through a formal process.

2. **Institutional constraints** - The process for removing an entity from the SDN list involves multiple agencies and potential congressional consultation under CAATSA, creating significant procedural hurdles within the limited timeframe.

3. **Conflicting official signals** - While unnamed sources suggest internal debates, the Secretary of State has explicitly denied plans to lift sanctions. This creates significant uncertainty about administration intentions.

4. **Limited immediate utility** - Given the physical damage to the pipeline from the 2022 sabotage, lifting sanctions would not immediately restore gas flow, reducing the practical urgency.

5. **Geopolitical complexity** - Using sanctions relief as part of Ukraine negotiations would likely require coordination with European allies, adding diplomatic complexity to an already procedurally challenging process.

These factors collectively suggest a low probability of sanctions being lifted before the resolution date, with the status quo bias and institutional constraints being particularly significant given the short timeframe.

## Probability Calibration

To arrive at a precise probability, I need to consider the various scenarios and their likelihoods:

**Scenario 1: Reports of internal debates lead to decision to lift sanctions**
- Probability that internal debates are occurring despite denials: ~35%
- Probability that pro-lifting faction prevails if debates are occurring: ~40%
- Probability that administrative process completes before July 1: ~50%
- Combined probability: 35% × 40% × 50% = 7%

**Scenario 2: Unexpected geopolitical breakthrough prompts accelerated action**
- Probability of a major breakthrough in Ukraine negotiations: ~20%
- Probability that such a breakthrough includes Nord Stream 2 sanctions relief: ~30%
- Probability that process completes before July 1 even with acceleration: ~60%
- Combined probability: 20% × 30% × 60% = 3.6%

Total probability (combining main scenarios): ~10.6%

I'll round to 11% for my final prediction, reflecting the low but non-zero probability that sanctions could be lifted within this timeframe.

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Nord Stream 2 AG be removed from OFAC's SDN List by July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view: 9% (from reference class analysis of previous sanctions decisions and procedural constraints)
3. Consistency: 11 of 100 times, Nord Stream 2 AG would be removed from the SDN List by July 1, 2025
4. Key evidence: (1) Secretary Rubio's explicit denial; (2) 8-week timeframe limits procedural feasibility; (3) Physical pipeline damage reduces immediate utility; (4) Confirmed internal White House debates
5. Blind spot: A secret, already-advanced sanctions relief process could make timeline feasible
6. Status quo adjustment: Current status is sanctioned; slight adjustment toward status quo reflected in final probability

Probability: 11%
Predicted Probability: 11.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context (2021-2022 sources):**
- **New York Times (Feb 2022)**: High reliability reporting on Biden's sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, reversing his earlier waiver.
- **Global Sanctions Blog (Feb 2022)**: Reliable technical details of OFAC's designation of Nord Stream 2 AG to the SDN list with a temporary wind-down license.
- **Euractiv (Feb 2022)**: Reliable reporting on Biden's sanctions announcement and Germany's certification halt.
- **CNN (May 2021)**: Reliable reporting on Biden's earlier waiver of sanctions, citing his concerns about damaging US-German relations.
- **NBC News (Feb 2021)**: Factual reporting on Congressional pressure for Nord Stream 2 sanctions enforcement.

**Current Information (April-May 2025):**
- **POLITICO (April 23, 2025)**: Primary source reporting on White House debates about lifting sanctions based on five unnamed sources. Reports Special Envoy Steve Witkoff supports lifting sanctions while Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum oppose. High credibility for Washington insider reporting.
- **Multiple international outlets (April 24-May 6, 2025)**: Various Russian, Polish, Chinese, German, and French media largely referencing the original POLITICO report without substantial new information. Medium reliability when consistently reporting the same information.
- **Trump press comments (May 5-6, 2025)**: Multiple outlets reporting Trump's statements about Nord Stream pipeline sabotage. While not directly addressing sanctions policy, demonstrates presidential attention to the pipeline issue.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- The sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG were formally imposed in February 2022 and company remains on the SDN list as of May 2025 (confirmed across multiple sources)
- Secretary of State Marco Rubio publicly opposes lifting sanctions according to multiple reports (consistent reporting across international sources citing POLITICO)
- Institutional barriers exist for rapidly removing SDN designations, including potential Congressional review periods under CAATSA (established regulatory process)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Active White House debate confirmed by POLITICO reporting with Special Envoy Witkoff supporting sanctions relief (based on unnamed but multiple sources)
- Secretary of Interior Burgum, who heads the White House Energy Dominance Committee, opposes lifting sanctions to protect US LNG market interests (consistent reporting across sources)
- Historical precedent exists for Nord Stream 2 sanctions flexibility (Biden's May 2021 waiver before reinstating sanctions in 2022)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Russian media claims about sanctions relief being considered as part of Ukraine negotiations (limited sourcing, potential bias)
- Trump's recent focus on Nord Stream sabotage rather than sanctions policy (tangential connection)
- Reports of former Nord Stream 2 director Matthias Warnig working with US investors on pipeline revival (unconfirmed, single-source reporting)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is approximately 56 days (May 6 to July 1, 2025). This timeframe is significant because:

1. Sanctions removal from the SDN list typically requires:
   - Policy coordination across multiple agencies
   - Legal review
   - Potential Congressional notification period (30 days under CAATSA)
   - Publication of delisting notice

2. If the timeframe were halved (28 days), probability would decrease to near-zero given the procedural impossibility of completing all required steps.

3. If doubled (112 days), probability would increase significantly (perhaps to 20-25%) as it would allow sufficient time for the complete process if political will existed.

## (d) Justification

Starting from the outside view base rate of 5% (derived from historical patterns of US sanctions relief for Russian energy entities), here's how current factors shift the probability:

**Factors decreasing likelihood:**
- Interior Secretary Burgum's reported opposition based on protecting US LNG export markets (strong opposition from a key energy policy figure)
- Secretary of State Rubio's public opposition (highest-ranking US diplomat opposes)
- POLITICO reports the idea "has not found much traction in the White House" despite discussions
- Only 56 days remain until deadline (highly constrained timeline for complex process)
- Bipartisan Congressional support for maintaining Russian sanctions (institutional resistance)

**Factors increasing likelihood:**
- Active internal White House debate confirmed by credible reporting (indicates possibility being seriously considered)
- Special Envoy Witkoff reportedly supports lifting sanctions (high-level advocacy exists)
- Previous historical waiver of Nord Stream 2 sanctions in 2021 shows precedent for flexibility
- Potential use as diplomatic leverage in Ukraine negotiations (strategic rationale exists)

The net impact is a modest increase from the base rate, but the limited timeframe and significant institutional/political opposition create substantial hurdles.

## Probability Calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 5%, I adjust upward to 10% based on:
1. Confirmed White House debate on the issue (+3%)
2. Historical precedent of previous waiver (+1%)
3. High-level support from Special Envoy Witkoff (+2%)
4. Potential strategic value in Ukraine negotiations (+2%)

However, I must adjust downward based on:
1. Limited 56-day timeframe for complex process (-1%)
2. Strong opposition from Secretary of State and Interior Secretary (-2%)

Final calibrated probability: 10%

In 10 out of 100 identical scenarios, the US would remove Nord Stream 2 AG from the SDN List before July 1, 2025. This appropriately weighs the confirmed debate against the significant barriers and tight timeline.

## Checklist:
1. Question: Will the US remove Nord Stream 2 AG from OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals list before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view base rate: 5% based on historical patterns of US sanctions on Russian energy assets
3. Consistency: In 10/100 identical scenarios, Nord Stream 2 AG would be removed from the SDN list before July 1, 2025
4. Key evidence: Active White House debate (+); High-level opposition from Secretaries Rubio/Burgum (-); Only 56 days until deadline (-); Previous 2021 sanctions waiver precedent (+)
5. Blind spot: Sudden diplomatic breakthrough in Ukraine negotiations necessitating rapid sanctions relief
6. Status quo advantage: Nord Stream 2 AG remains sanctioned; short timeline favors continuation of current policy

Probability: 10%
Predicted Probability: 10.0%

Output:
Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
“Will the US lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG by July 1, 2025?” resolves Yes if by that date the SDN designation is removed. We have ~8 weeks until resolution.

2. Source analysis  
• Politico (Apr 23, 2025): Reports internal White House debate about lifting sanctions; cites five unnamed insiders. Mixed reliability, contradicted by denials. (Moderate)  
• AA.com.tr (Apr 26, 2025): Secretary Rubio “unequivocally” denies any plan to lift Nord Stream 2 sanctions. High reliability for official stance. (Strong)  
• Baker McKenzie (Feb 2022): Describes GL 4 wind-down license to Mar 2, 2022 and SDN designation of Nord Stream 2 AG. Accurate but dated. (Weak for current forecast)  
• N-tv (Apr 29, 2025): German court upholds cancellation of Nord Stream 2 AG’s bank accounts due to US sanctions risk. Shows sanctions are actively enforced. (Moderate)  
• Reuters via MK.ru (May 5, 2025): Reports consideration of new sanctions on Russia, indicating continued hawkish turn. Russia remains under pressure. (Moderate)

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence (+/– large shifts)  
• Rubio’s denial (AA, Apr 26): Direct official refutation of any plan to lift sanctions.  
• CAATSA’s 30-day congressional review requirement: Procedural barrier that consumes most of 8 weeks.  

Moderate evidence (+/– moderate shifts)  
• Politico debate report: Suggests some officials favor relief; faces internal opposition.  
• German court ruling: Signals practical enforcement and commitment to sanctions.  
• Recent extension of Russia sanctions (Apr 2025): Implies no reversal momentum.

Weak evidence (+/– small shifts)  
• Speculation in Russian-language outlets about Trump deal-making.  
• Economic arguments from energy analysts favoring or opposing relief.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in ~8 weeks.  
– If timeframe halved (4 weeks): Lifting becomes nearly impossible given CAATSA procedures.  
– If doubled (~16 weeks): Small chance increases modestly if internal debates coalesce and notification period completes.  

5. Justification  
Base rate for reversing a major US sanctions designation within two years is low (~15–20%), given geopolitical stakes and procedural hurdles.  
Adjustments:  
–Strong pushback and explicit denials from key officials (Rubio, Blinken) pull probability down (–8%).  
–CAATSA’s 30-day notice plus likely congressional scrutiny make logistics extremely tight (–5%).  
–Internal White House debate and peace-talk incentives provide slight upward pull (+3%).  
Net adjustment: from ~15% base rate → 5% net shift down → ~10% probability.

Other considerations:  
• Status quo bias: sanctions remain in place absent major policy pivot.  
• Hidden-leak risk: Unreported back-channel deals could raise chance—but still limited by legal constraints.  

Probability calibration  
Given the heavy procedural and political obstacles, 10% reflects a low but non-zero chance. A ±10% swing would meaningfully alter the expected difficulty of reversing sanctions: 0% would imply certainty of “No,” 20% would imply a plausible behind-the-scenes pivot we see no clear evidence for.

Checklist:  
1. Title/resolution: lifting US OFAC SDN designation on Nord Stream 2 AG by July 1, 2025 (8 weeks).  
2. Base rate: ~15–20% for major sanctions reversals within two years.  
3. Consistency: “10 times out of 100, the US lifts Nord Stream 2 sanctions by this deadline.”  
4. Key evidence: Rubio’s denial; CAATSA timeline; Politico debate; extension of Russia sanctions; German court action.  
5. Blind-spot: Secret peace deal that trades pipeline sanctions for a Ukraine ceasefire might raise odds unexpectedly.  
6. Status quo: Sanctions maintained, major policy reversals rare on short notice.

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase & resolution criteria  
   The question asks: “Will the U.S. remove Nord Stream 2 AG from OFAC’s SDN list by July 1, 2025?” That is, will OFAC have delisted Nord Stream 2 AG on or before that date?  

2. Outside-view base rate  
   Reference class: major U.S. energy‐sector sanctions reversals within a two-month window after imposition or extension. Historical frequency: essentially zero (Biden’s May 2021 Nord Stream 2 waiver came four months after a congressional deadline, not two). Base rate ≈1–2%.

3. Source analysis  
   • Politico (Apr 23, 2025): Five anonymous insiders report a White House debate over lifting NS 2 sanctions. Proponent: Special Envoy Witkoff; opponents: Rubio, Burgum. Medium‐high reliability for factual reporting of an internal debate; opinions labeled.  
   • AA.com.tr (Mar 2025): Quotes Senator Rubio denying any such debate. Named source, high reliability for Rubio’s stance.  
   • Reuters (May 5, 2025): Reports U.S. may consider new Russia sanctions; mentions Rubio opposing NS 2 lift. Named sources, high reliability.  
   • N-tv (Apr 29, 2025): German court upholds account closures for NS 2 AG, citing U.S. secondary‐sanctions risk. Factual legal ruling, medium‐high reliability.  
   • Multiple Russian outlets (May 5–6, 2025): Report Trump’s press‐conference claims on pipeline sabotage and note that the White House is “discussing” NS 2 sanctions lift. Varied reliability; editorial slant.  

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong (➕/➖5–10%)  
   – Politico’s report of an active debate (insider consensus, direct causal mechanism for lift).  
   – AA.com.tr & Rubio’s categorical denial (opposed by major policymaker).  
   – CAATSA/Executive Order legal constraints & congressional review (structural barrier).  
   Moderate (➕/➖2–5%)  
   – EU/German disinterest in reviving NS 2 (allied dynamics reduce U.S. incentive).  
   – U.S. LNG exporters’ lobbying against lift (domestic economic pressure).  
   Weak (➕/➖<2%)  
   – Trump’s commentary on sabotage (irrelevant noise).  
   – German court case on bank accounts (status quo reinforcement but not direct to delisting).  

5. Timeframe analysis  
   Forecast horizon ≈56 days. Short window makes reversal harder. If the window were doubled (to 112 days), probability might modestly rise (+3–5%) to account for more runway; if halved (28 days), probability would shrink proportionally (–2–3%).

6. Inside-view justification  
   – Status quo: As of May 2025, Nord Stream 2 AG sits on the SDN list under a March 2025 executive order extending sanctions to 2026.  
   – White House dynamics: Debate exists but high‐level opponents (Sec State Rubio, Sec Interior Burgum) block consensus.  
   – Congressional hurdles: CAATSA imposes a 30-day congressional review period for any sanction change; disapproval resolutions are possible.  
   – Allied and market factors: Germany/EU are not pushing for NS 2’s revival; U.S. LNG industry would suffer.  
   – Reference class: Rare to impossible to reverse major energy sanctions within two months.  
   Taken together, these factors tilt heavily toward “No.” A small probability remains for an unexpected back-channel deal or political sea-change, but overall the chance is very low.

Probability calibration  
Outside-view base: ~2%  
+ Moderate bump for active internal debate (≈+3%)  
– Legal & political barriers (≈–2%)  
Final inside-view probability: 3–5% → I set it at 5%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase & resolution: ✓  
2. Base rate from reference class: 1–2% → used as anchor  
3. Consistency check: “5 out of 100 times, U.S. delists NS 2 AG by July 1, 2025.”  
4. Key evidence (4): internal debate; strong opponents; CAATSA hurdles; EU disinterest  
5. Blind spot: A surprise Ukraine peace deal gives U.S. cover to lift sanctions; probability small.  
6. Status quo bias: sanctions likely to remain; short time window reinforces inertia.

• Variety of Russian/Polish gossip articles quoting President Trump on “knowing who blew up NS pipelines” – largely rhetorical; little factual value for delisting prospects.  Low reliability for our purpose.  
• N-tv 29 Apr 2025 German court ruling that Sparkasse may close NS-2 AG accounts out of fear of secondary U.S. sanctions – strong signal that market and legal actors still expect sanctions to remain.  High reliability.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong, status-quo evidence (pushes toward “No”):  
• Structural: CAATSA requires 30-day congressional notice and permits fast-track disapproval; Congress presently hostile (72-senator bill for *more* sanctions).  
• Historical: 0/14 Russia-energy SDNs delisted while war ongoing (2014-2025).  
• Time constraint: 56 days left; OFAC inter-agency delist cycle typically ≥60 days.  
Moderate evidence toward “Yes”:  
• Politico report of internal debate; shows at least some policymaking activity.  
Weak evidence toward “Yes”:  
• Public speculation that delisting could lower gas prices and aid Ukraine deal.  
• Trump’s idiosyncratic bargaining style; precedent of 2021 Biden waiver (though that was a waiver before designation, not a delisting).

Net weighting: strong, multi-sourced, institutional evidence >>> single-sourced rumour.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining: ≈ 56 days to 1 Jul 2025.  
If the deadline were doubled (112 days) I would move probability from 3 % to ~6 % (more time to navigate CAATSA and shift politics).  If halved (28 days) I would drop to ~1 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start from outside-view 2 %.  
+0.8 pp for indication of an internal NS-2 discussion (Politico) and Trump’s deal-making reputation.  
–0.5 pp for on-record denials and apparent lack of inter-agency paperwork.  
–0.3 pp for compressed procedural window (56 days < usual).  
+0.0 pp for Germany/EU stance (still opposed; neutral to slightly negative).  
Rounded result: 3 %.

Probability calibration
My best estimate: there is about a 3 % chance that, when Metaculus queries the OFAC SDN list on or after 1 July 2025, “Nord Stream 2 AG” will be absent.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Nord Stream 2 AG be off the OFAC SDN list by 1 Jul 2025?  
2. Outside base rate 2 %; final forecast rooted there.  
3. Consistency: “About 3 out of 100 times, NS-2 AG would be delisted within the next 56 days.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) CAATSA + bipartisan hostility; (ii) 0/14 historical delistings; (iii) 56-day bureaucratic lag; (iv) only one anonymous Politico report; (v) on-record Rubio denial & new Senate sanctions bill.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden comprehensive Ukraine peace deal coupled with large U.S.–Russia prisoner-swap–energy package fast-tracked through Congress could force delisting.  Would push probability up sharply.  
6. Status-quo bias re-checked; slight nudge toward “No” retained.

Probability: 3%
Predicted Probability: 3.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

### Historical Context Sources (2021-2022)
1. **New York Times articles (Feb 2022)** - Reliable mainstream source confirming Biden imposed sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG as Russia began its Ukraine invasion, after previously waiving them. Contains factual reporting on official decisions with clear attribution.

2. **Baker McKenzie Blog (Feb 2022)** - Legal/professional source providing specific details on OFAC's addition of Nord Stream 2 AG to the SDN list and the limited wind-down license. Highly reliable for technical sanctions details.

3. **Euractiv article (Feb 2022)** - EU-focused news source corroborating the NYT reporting with additional European perspective. Contains factual information about the Biden administration's actions.

4. **CNN article (May 2021)** - Reports on Biden's earlier decision to waive sanctions despite opposing the pipeline. Contains both factual reporting of decisions and opinions from unnamed sources regarding internal deliberations.

5. **NBC News article (Feb 2021)** - Reports on bipartisan congressional pressure regarding Nord Stream 2 sanctions. Documents factual information about congressional communications.

### Current News Articles (April-May 2025)
1. **POLITICO article (April 23, 2025)** - Reports internal White House debates about lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, including Nord Stream 2. Cites five unnamed people familiar with discussions. Reports Special Envoy Steve Witkoff supports lifting sanctions while Secretary of State Marco Rubio opposes. Key original source that many other articles reference.

2. **Various Russian/East European sources (May 2025)** - Multiple outlets (Tsargrad TV, Rambler, Mail.Ru, TVN24, etc.) reference the Politico reporting while adding Trump's recent comments about the Nord Stream sabotage. These add limited new factual information beyond Trump's public statements.

3. **Multiple sources note Secretary Rubio's denial** - Several articles mention that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has publicly denied the Politico report about planned lifting of sanctions, calling it "unequivocally false."

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

### Strong Evidence
1. **Current sanctions status and timeframe** - Nord Stream 2 AG is currently on the SDN list, with less than 8 weeks until the resolution date. Removing an entity from the SDN list requires a formal administrative process with potential congressional notification requirements under CAATSA.

2. **Secretary Rubio's explicit denial** - The current Secretary of State has publicly rejected reports about plans to lift sanctions. As the cabinet official with primary responsibility for sanctions implementation, this represents a significant official position contrary to sanctions relief.

3. **Physical damage to pipeline infrastructure** - Multiple sources confirm the September 2022 sabotage damaged the Nord Stream pipelines. This reduces the immediate practical benefit of lifting sanctions since the pipeline would still require repairs to be operational.

### Moderate Evidence
1. **Internal administration debate** - Politico's reporting (citing five unnamed sources) indicates internal discussions about potentially lifting sanctions, with divided opinions among officials. While unconfirmed officially, the detail and specificity suggest some level of consideration.

2. **Historical pattern of policy volatility** - The historical record shows US policy on Nord Stream 2 sanctions has shifted multiple times (imposed under Trump, waived then reimposed under Biden), demonstrating that sanctions positions can change based on geopolitical developments.

3. **Trump's focus on Ukraine settlement** - Recent statements indicate President Trump is actively engaged in seeking an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Lifting energy sanctions could potentially be part of broader negotiations, though no direct connection has been established.

### Weak Evidence
1. **Private-sector interest** - One article mentions former Nord Stream 2 director Matthias Warnig working with US investors on reviving the pipeline, suggesting potential commercial pressure for sanctions relief.

2. **European Commission disinterest** - A claim that the European Commission is not interested in restoring the pipeline's operation could complicate US efforts to coordinate sanctions relief with allies.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The timeframe is approximately 8 weeks from today (May 6, 2025) to the resolution date (July 1, 2025).

This is a relatively short period for implementing a significant sanctions policy change, considering:
- The formal administrative process for removing an entity from the SDN list
- CAATSA requirements for congressional notification before lifting certain Russia-related sanctions
- The need for interagency coordination and potentially international consultation

If the timeframe were halved (4 weeks), the probability would decrease substantially (perhaps to 3-5%) as the procedural constraints would become even more limiting.

If the timeframe were doubled (16 weeks), the probability might increase moderately (perhaps to 15-20%) as it would allow more time for the administrative process and potential diplomatic negotiations.

## (d) Justification:

The most compelling factors affecting the likelihood of sanctions being lifted before July 1, 2025 are:

1. **Status quo bias** - Nord Stream 2 AG is currently sanctioned, and maintaining this status requires no action. Lifting sanctions requires affirmative steps through a formal process.

2. **Institutional constraints** - The process for removing an entity from the SDN list involves multiple agencies and potential congressional consultation under CAATSA, creating significant procedural hurdles within the limited timeframe.

3. **Conflicting official signals** - While unnamed sources suggest internal debates, the Secretary of State has explicitly denied plans to lift sanctions. This creates significant uncertainty about administration intentions.

4. **Limited immediate utility** - Given the physical damage to the pipeline from the 2022 sabotage, lifting sanctions would not immediately restore gas flow, reducing the practical urgency.

5. **Geopolitical complexity** - Using sanctions relief as part of Ukraine negotiations would likely require coordination with European allies, adding diplomatic complexity to an already procedurally challenging process.

These factors collectively suggest a low probability of sanctions being lifted before the resolution date, with the status quo bias and institutional constraints being particularly significant given the short timeframe.

## Probability Calibration

To arrive at a precise probability, I need to consider the various scenarios and their likelihoods:

**Scenario 1: Reports of internal debates lead to decision to lift sanctions**
- Probability that internal debates are occurring despite denials: ~35%
- Probability that pro-lifting faction prevails if debates are occurring: ~40%
- Probability that administrative process completes before July 1: ~50%
- Combined probability: 35% × 40% × 50% = 7%

**Scenario 2: Unexpected geopolitical breakthrough prompts accelerated action**
- Probability of a major breakthrough in Ukraine negotiations: ~20%
- Probability that such a breakthrough includes Nord Stream 2 sanctions relief: ~30%
- Probability that process completes before July 1 even with acceleration: ~60%
- Combined probability: 20% × 30% × 60% = 3.6%

Total probability (combining main scenarios): ~10.6%

I'll round to 11% for my final prediction, reflecting the low but non-zero probability that sanctions could be lifted within this timeframe.

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Nord Stream 2 AG be removed from OFAC's SDN List by July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view: 9% (from reference class analysis of previous sanctions decisions and procedural constraints)
3. Consistency: 11 of 100 times, Nord Stream 2 AG would be removed from the SDN List by July 1, 2025
4. Key evidence: (1) Secretary Rubio's explicit denial; (2) 8-week timeframe limits procedural feasibility; (3) Physical pipeline damage reduces immediate utility; (4) Confirmed internal White House debates
5. Blind spot: A secret, already-advanced sanctions relief process could make timeline feasible
6. Status quo adjustment: Current status is sanctioned; slight adjustment toward status quo reflected in final probability

Probability: 11%
Predicted Probability: 11.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context (2021-2022 sources):**
- **New York Times (Feb 2022)**: High reliability reporting on Biden's sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, reversing his earlier waiver.
- **Global Sanctions Blog (Feb 2022)**: Reliable technical details of OFAC's designation of Nord Stream 2 AG to the SDN list with a temporary wind-down license.
- **Euractiv (Feb 2022)**: Reliable reporting on Biden's sanctions announcement and Germany's certification halt.
- **CNN (May 2021)**: Reliable reporting on Biden's earlier waiver of sanctions, citing his concerns about damaging US-German relations.
- **NBC News (Feb 2021)**: Factual reporting on Congressional pressure for Nord Stream 2 sanctions enforcement.

**Current Information (April-May 2025):**
- **POLITICO (April 23, 2025)**: Primary source reporting on White House debates about lifting sanctions based on five unnamed sources. Reports Special Envoy Steve Witkoff supports lifting sanctions while Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum oppose. High credibility for Washington insider reporting.
- **Multiple international outlets (April 24-May 6, 2025)**: Various Russian, Polish, Chinese, German, and French media largely referencing the original POLITICO report without substantial new information. Medium reliability when consistently reporting the same information.
- **Trump press comments (May 5-6, 2025)**: Multiple outlets reporting Trump's statements about Nord Stream pipeline sabotage. While not directly addressing sanctions policy, demonstrates presidential attention to the pipeline issue.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- The sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG were formally imposed in February 2022 and company remains on the SDN list as of May 2025 (confirmed across multiple sources)
- Secretary of State Marco Rubio publicly opposes lifting sanctions according to multiple reports (consistent reporting across international sources citing POLITICO)
- Institutional barriers exist for rapidly removing SDN designations, including potential Congressional review periods under CAATSA (established regulatory process)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Active White House debate confirmed by POLITICO reporting with Special Envoy Witkoff supporting sanctions relief (based on unnamed but multiple sources)
- Secretary of Interior Burgum, who heads the White House Energy Dominance Committee, opposes lifting sanctions to protect US LNG market interests (consistent reporting across sources)
- Historical precedent exists for Nord Stream 2 sanctions flexibility (Biden's May 2021 waiver before reinstating sanctions in 2022)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Russian media claims about sanctions relief being considered as part of Ukraine negotiations (limited sourcing, potential bias)
- Trump's recent focus on Nord Stream sabotage rather than sanctions policy (tangential connection)
- Reports of former Nord Stream 2 director Matthias Warnig working with US investors on pipeline revival (unconfirmed, single-source reporting)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is approximately 56 days (May 6 to July 1, 2025). This timeframe is significant because:

1. Sanctions removal from the SDN list typically requires:
   - Policy coordination across multiple agencies
   - Legal review
   - Potential Congressional notification period (30 days under CAATSA)
   - Publication of delisting notice

2. If the timeframe were halved (28 days), probability would decrease to near-zero given the procedural impossibility of completing all required steps.

3. If doubled (112 days), probability would increase significantly (perhaps to 20-25%) as it would allow sufficient time for the complete process if political will existed.

## (d) Justification

Starting from the outside view base rate of 5% (derived from historical patterns of US sanctions relief for Russian energy entities), here's how current factors shift the probability:

**Factors decreasing likelihood:**
- Interior Secretary Burgum's reported opposition based on protecting US LNG export markets (strong opposition from a key energy policy figure)
- Secretary of State Rubio's public opposition (highest-ranking US diplomat opposes)
- POLITICO reports the idea "has not found much traction in the White House" despite discussions
- Only 56 days remain until deadline (highly constrained timeline for complex process)
- Bipartisan Congressional support for maintaining Russian sanctions (institutional resistance)

**Factors increasing likelihood:**
- Active internal White House debate confirmed by credible reporting (indicates possibility being seriously considered)
- Special Envoy Witkoff reportedly supports lifting sanctions (high-level advocacy exists)
- Previous historical waiver of Nord Stream 2 sanctions in 2021 shows precedent for flexibility
- Potential use as diplomatic leverage in Ukraine negotiations (strategic rationale exists)

The net impact is a modest increase from the base rate, but the limited timeframe and significant institutional/political opposition create substantial hurdles.

## Probability Calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 5%, I adjust upward to 10% based on:
1. Confirmed White House debate on the issue (+3%)
2. Historical precedent of previous waiver (+1%)
3. High-level support from Special Envoy Witkoff (+2%)
4. Potential strategic value in Ukraine negotiations (+2%)

However, I must adjust downward based on:
1. Limited 56-day timeframe for complex process (-1%)
2. Strong opposition from Secretary of State and Interior Secretary (-2%)

Final calibrated probability: 10%

In 10 out of 100 identical scenarios, the US would remove Nord Stream 2 AG from the SDN List before July 1, 2025. This appropriately weighs the confirmed debate against the significant barriers and tight timeline.

## Checklist:
1. Question: Will the US remove Nord Stream 2 AG from OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals list before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view base rate: 5% based on historical patterns of US sanctions on Russian energy assets
3. Consistency: In 10/100 identical scenarios, Nord Stream 2 AG would be removed from the SDN list before July 1, 2025
4. Key evidence: Active White House debate (+); High-level opposition from Secretaries Rubio/Burgum (-); Only 56 days until deadline (-); Previous 2021 sanctions waiver precedent (+)
5. Blind spot: Sudden diplomatic breakthrough in Ukraine negotiations necessitating rapid sanctions relief
6. Status quo advantage: Nord Stream 2 AG remains sanctioned; short timeline favors continuation of current policy

Probability: 10%
Predicted Probability: 10.0%

Output:
Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
“Will the US lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG by July 1, 2025?” resolves Yes if by that date the SDN designation is removed. We have ~8 weeks until resolution.

2. Source analysis  
• Politico (Apr 23, 2025): Reports internal White House debate about lifting sanctions; cites five unnamed insiders. Mixed reliability, contradicted by denials. (Moderate)  
• AA.com.tr (Apr 26, 2025): Secretary Rubio “unequivocally” denies any plan to lift Nord Stream 2 sanctions. High reliability for official stance. (Strong)  
• Baker McKenzie (Feb 2022): Describes GL 4 wind-down license to Mar 2, 2022 and SDN designation of Nord Stream 2 AG. Accurate but dated. (Weak for current forecast)  
• N-tv (Apr 29, 2025): German court upholds cancellation of Nord Stream 2 AG’s bank accounts due to US sanctions risk. Shows sanctions are actively enforced. (Moderate)  
• Reuters via MK.ru (May 5, 2025): Reports consideration of new sanctions on Russia, indicating continued hawkish turn. Russia remains under pressure. (Moderate)

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence (+/– large shifts)  
• Rubio’s denial (AA, Apr 26): Direct official refutation of any plan to lift sanctions.  
• CAATSA’s 30-day congressional review requirement: Procedural barrier that consumes most of 8 weeks.  

Moderate evidence (+/– moderate shifts)  
• Politico debate report: Suggests some officials favor relief; faces internal opposition.  
• German court ruling: Signals practical enforcement and commitment to sanctions.  
• Recent extension of Russia sanctions (Apr 2025): Implies no reversal momentum.

Weak evidence (+/– small shifts)  
• Speculation in Russian-language outlets about Trump deal-making.  
• Economic arguments from energy analysts favoring or opposing relief.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in ~8 weeks.  
– If timeframe halved (4 weeks): Lifting becomes nearly impossible given CAATSA procedures.  
– If doubled (~16 weeks): Small chance increases modestly if internal debates coalesce and notification period completes.  

5. Justification  
Base rate for reversing a major US sanctions designation within two years is low (~15–20%), given geopolitical stakes and procedural hurdles.  
Adjustments:  
–Strong pushback and explicit denials from key officials (Rubio, Blinken) pull probability down (–8%).  
–CAATSA’s 30-day notice plus likely congressional scrutiny make logistics extremely tight (–5%).  
–Internal White House debate and peace-talk incentives provide slight upward pull (+3%).  
Net adjustment: from ~15% base rate → 5% net shift down → ~10% probability.

Other considerations:  
• Status quo bias: sanctions remain in place absent major policy pivot.  
• Hidden-leak risk: Unreported back-channel deals could raise chance—but still limited by legal constraints.  

Probability calibration  
Given the heavy procedural and political obstacles, 10% reflects a low but non-zero chance. A ±10% swing would meaningfully alter the expected difficulty of reversing sanctions: 0% would imply certainty of “No,” 20% would imply a plausible behind-the-scenes pivot we see no clear evidence for.

Checklist:  
1. Title/resolution: lifting US OFAC SDN designation on Nord Stream 2 AG by July 1, 2025 (8 weeks).  
2. Base rate: ~15–20% for major sanctions reversals within two years.  
3. Consistency: “10 times out of 100, the US lifts Nord Stream 2 sanctions by this deadline.”  
4. Key evidence: Rubio’s denial; CAATSA timeline; Politico debate; extension of Russia sanctions; German court action.  
5. Blind-spot: Secret peace deal that trades pipeline sanctions for a Ukraine ceasefire might raise odds unexpectedly.  
6. Status quo: Sanctions maintained, major policy reversals rare on short notice.

Probability: 10%
Predicted Probability: 10.0%

Output:
Analysis:

1. Paraphrase & resolution criteria  
   The question asks: “Will the U.S. remove Nord Stream 2 AG from OFAC’s SDN list by July 1, 2025?” That is, will OFAC have delisted Nord Stream 2 AG on or before that date?  

2. Outside-view base rate  
   Reference class: major U.S. energy‐sector sanctions reversals within a two-month window after imposition or extension. Historical frequency: essentially zero (Biden’s May 2021 Nord Stream 2 waiver came four months after a congressional deadline, not two). Base rate ≈1–2%.

3. Source analysis  
   • Politico (Apr 23, 2025): Five anonymous insiders report a White House debate over lifting NS 2 sanctions. Proponent: Special Envoy Witkoff; opponents: Rubio, Burgum. Medium‐high reliability for factual reporting of an internal debate; opinions labeled.  
   • AA.com.tr (Mar 2025): Quotes Senator Rubio denying any such debate. Named source, high reliability for Rubio’s stance.  
   • Reuters (May 5, 2025): Reports U.S. may consider new Russia sanctions; mentions Rubio opposing NS 2 lift. Named sources, high reliability.  
   • N-tv (Apr 29, 2025): German court upholds account closures for NS 2 AG, citing U.S. secondary‐sanctions risk. Factual legal ruling, medium‐high reliability.  
   • Multiple Russian outlets (May 5–6, 2025): Report Trump’s press‐conference claims on pipeline sabotage and note that the White House is “discussing” NS 2 sanctions lift. Varied reliability; editorial slant.  

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong (➕/➖5–10%)  
   – Politico’s report of an active debate (insider consensus, direct causal mechanism for lift).  
   – AA.com.tr & Rubio’s categorical denial (opposed by major policymaker).  
   – CAATSA/Executive Order legal constraints & congressional review (structural barrier).  
   Moderate (➕/➖2–5%)  
   – EU/German disinterest in reviving NS 2 (allied dynamics reduce U.S. incentive).  
   – U.S. LNG exporters’ lobbying against lift (domestic economic pressure).  
   Weak (➕/➖<2%)  
   – Trump’s commentary on sabotage (irrelevant noise).  
   – German court case on bank accounts (status quo reinforcement but not direct to delisting).  

5. Timeframe analysis  
   Forecast horizon ≈56 days. Short window makes reversal harder. If the window were doubled (to 112 days), probability might modestly rise (+3–5%) to account for more runway; if halved (28 days), probability would shrink proportionally (–2–3%).

6. Inside-view justification  
   – Status quo: As of May 2025, Nord Stream 2 AG sits on the SDN list under a March 2025 executive order extending sanctions to 2026.  
   – White House dynamics: Debate exists but high‐level opponents (Sec State Rubio, Sec Interior Burgum) block consensus.  
   – Congressional hurdles: CAATSA imposes a 30-day congressional review period for any sanction change; disapproval resolutions are possible.  
   – Allied and market factors: Germany/EU are not pushing for NS 2’s revival; U.S. LNG industry would suffer.  
   – Reference class: Rare to impossible to reverse major energy sanctions within two months.  
   Taken together, these factors tilt heavily toward “No.” A small probability remains for an unexpected back-channel deal or political sea-change, but overall the chance is very low.

Probability calibration  
Outside-view base: ~2%  
+ Moderate bump for active internal debate (≈+3%)  
– Legal & political barriers (≈–2%)  
Final inside-view probability: 3–5% → I set it at 5%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase & resolution: ✓  
2. Base rate from reference class: 1–2% → used as anchor  
3. Consistency check: “5 out of 100 times, U.S. delists NS 2 AG by July 1, 2025.”  
4. Key evidence (4): internal debate; strong opponents; CAATSA hurdles; EU disinterest  
5. Blind spot: A surprise Ukraine peace deal gives U.S. cover to lift sanctions; probability small.  
6. Status quo bias: sanctions likely to remain; short time window reinforces inertia.

(a) Source analysis  
• New York Times 24 Feb 2022, CNN 25 May 2021, Euractiv 23 Feb 2022, Baker-McKenzie blog 24 Feb 2022 – contemporaneous, fact-heavy, named U.S./German officials.  High reliability; give baseline that NS-2 AG is on the SDN list and why.  
• Politico 23 Apr 2025 + follow-up TASS/China.com/Courrier-Int./MK.ru/Prime/Kommer­sant – single anonymously-sourced claim that “the White House is debating lifting sanctions”, quickly followed by on-record denials by Sec.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong, status-quo evidence (pushes toward “No”):

• Historical: 0/14 Russia-energy SDNs delisted while war ongoing (2014-2025).  
• Time constraint: 56 days left; OFAC inter-agency delist cycle typically ≥60 days.  
Moderate evidence toward “Yes”:  
• Politico report of internal debate; shows at least some policymaking activity.
