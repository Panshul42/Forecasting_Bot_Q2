Analysis:
This question hinges on understanding how and when the U.S. government has historically used the term “blockade” in official accusations, particularly against major powers, and whether it has ever applied similar language to China over Taiwan. Key sub-issues include (1) U.S. precedent for publicly labeling maritime coercion as a “blockade” (e.g., Russia’s 2022 actions against Ukrainian ports), (2) any prior instances—if any—of the U.S. accusing China of a blockade or blockade‐like behavior around Taiwan or in the South China Sea, and (3) the diplomatic and strategic thresholds required for U.S. officials to escalate rhetoric to the level of a formal “blockade” accusation. Gathering this historical context will establish a base‐rate estimate of how often and under what circumstances the U.S. uses “blockade” in its public statements, which serves as the benchmark for forecasting whether the U.S. is likely to accuse China by mid-2025.

Analysis:
The key to assessing whether the US will publicly accuse China of blockading Taiwan by July 1, 2025, is tracking statements from US government officials—especially from the State Department, the National Security Council, congressional hearings, and senior administration press briefings—regarding Chinese naval maneuvers around Taiwan’s ports. We need to know if any US official has already used the term “blockade” or “blockading” in describing PRC actions, or if there have been mounting calls in Washington to characterize Chinese exercises as a de facto blockade. Recent developments—such as Chinese naval drills encircling Taiwan’s ports, US naval freedom-of-navigation operations, or sharp language from US diplomats—will inform our inside-view adjustment from the baseline probability.

Summary of “First Taiwan Strait Crisis” (1954–1955)

Overview
• Also called the Formosa, Offshore Islands, Quemoy-Matsu or 1955 Taiwan Strait Crisis.  
• Brief armed conflict between the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) over small ROC-held islands near the mainland.

Background
• January 1950: President Truman declares U.S. won’t intervene in Chinese civil conflict or aid ROC on Taiwan.  
• June 1950 (Korean War outbreak): Truman orders U.S. Seventh Fleet into Taiwan Strait to “prevent any attack on Formosa.”  
• 1951 Treaty of San Francisco: Japan cedes Taiwan but sovereignty recipient unspecified; ROC and PRC excluded.  
• Early 1953: President Eisenhower lifts Seventh Fleet’s prohibition on ROC offensive operations, leading ROC to resume a “Closed Port” aerial/naval blockade of Chinese coast.

Key Events
• July 23, 1954: PRC’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) accidentally shoots down Cathay Pacific DC-4 (VR-HEU), killing 10. U.S. carriers Hornet and Philippine Sea respond.  
• August 2, 1954: PLA’s Peng Dehuai establishes tactical command for an eastern-front offensive.  
• August 1954: ROC deploys 58,000 troops on Kinmen, 15,000 on Matsu; begins building defenses. PRC begins shelling these islands.  
• August 11, 1954: Premier Zhou Enlai declares intent to “liberate” Taiwan; dispatches PLA for bombardment.  
• September 3, 1954: Heavy artillery bombardment of Kinmen kills two U.S. military advisers.  
• November 1954: PLA bombs the Tachen (Dachen) Islands.

U.S.–ROC Responses
• December 1954: U.S. and ROC sign the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty.  
• January 1955: U.S. Congress passes the Formosa (Taiwan) Resolution, authorizing President Eisenhower to defend ROC-held territory.  
• Early 1955: U.S. Navy assists ROC evacuation of Tachen Islands.

De-escalation and Aftermath
• April 1955: Premier Zhou signals willingness to negotiate at the Bandung Conference.  
• May 1955: PLA ceases shelling Kinmen and Matsu.  
• August 1955: Ambassadorial-level talks between U.S. and PRC open in Geneva.  
• Despite ceasefire, the core dispute over Taiwan’s status remains unresolved, leading to subsequent crises (e.g., Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958).

Article title: “A Chinese Blockade of Taiwan” (U.S. Naval Institute, Sept. 1, 1984)

Key points

1. Context and strategic framing  
  • Since 1949, Taiwan’s status has been central to U.S.–China relations.  
  • U.S. treaty obligations to defend Taiwan ended in 1979, leaving policymakers “torn between Taiwan’s being part of China and their desire to help the people of Taiwan maintain their freedoms.”  
  • The author argues that, whereas mid-20th-century analyses focused on invasion, by 1984 the more plausible Chinese military option against Taiwan was a naval blockade.

2. Historical background  
  • 1949–50: Nationalist government retreats to Taiwan; China plans amphibious invasion but cancels it when the Korean War prompts the U.S. to deploy the Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait.  
  • 1950s: Two crises over offshore islands (the Quemoy–Matsu crises), but no Chinese plan to invade Taiwan proper.  
  • 1960s: Relatively quiet; the last significant Taiwan Strait naval combat action occurred in 1965.  
  • Chinese naval buildup through the 1950s–60s did not include sufficient landing ships, marines, shore-bombardment artillery, or air-superiority assets to mount a full-scale invasion.

3. Chinese naval force structure (since the 1950s)  
  • Attack submarines: > 100  
  • Destroyers and frigates: ≈ 40  
  • Missile boats: ≈ 200  
  • Inherited U.S. WWII landing ships: ≈ 30 (most aging; replacement begun in late 1970s)  
  • Taiwan’s navy (circa 1984): ~ 30 destroyers/frigates (40 years old)  

4. Author’s analysis and rationale for blockade over invasion  
  • Invasion risks and costs:  
    – Taiwan possesses extensive coastal fortifications, well-trained ground and air forces, and would inflict heavy casualties.  
    – Amphibious invasion is weather-dependent and could fail.  
    – Building sufficient landing ships and supporting assets would require a large resource commitment.  
  • Blockade advantages (implied):  
    – Leverages China’s existing submarine, surface combatant, and missile-boat fleet.  
    – Imposes economic and political pressure without the high attrition and logistical burden of an amphibious assault.

<Summary source="https://warontherocks.com/2024/06/a-chinese-economic-blockade-of-taiwan-would-fail-or-launch-a-war/">
Here are the key points from Dmitri Alperovitch’s June 5, 2024 War on the Rocks article “A Chinese Economic Blockade of Taiwan Would Fail or Launch a War”:

1. Context and Threat Perceptions  
• Last month’s “Joint Sword 2024 A” exercise saw China nearly encircle Taiwan with dozens of warships and fighter jets in response to President Lai Ching-te’s inauguration. Its name suggests more such exercises may follow.  
• Multiple analysts—and Taipei’s own Deputy Foreign Minister Roy Chun Lee—believe China is more likely to attempt an economic blockade or “gray zone” coercion than a full-scale invasion, aiming to “win the war without an actual fight.”

2. Author’s Argument (from his book World on the Brink)  
• Despite China’s decades-long capability, it has not tried a blockade—because it would be unlikely to succeed and almost certain to trigger either a broader war or a humiliating defeat.  
• Betting Taiwan’s survival on China choosing options short of war is, in Alperovitch’s view, “a grave error.”

3. Possible Blockade Scenarios  
• A “no-go” maritime exclusion zone around Taiwan, with threats to target any vessel—akin to Russia’s 2022 Black Sea declaration.  
• A partial or full “maritime quarantine,” with China inspecting and selectively interdicting shipping to and from Taiwanese ports.

4. Why a Blockade Would Fail  
a) Economic Self-Harm  
  – Taiwan made over 60 percent of the world’s semiconductors and over 70 percent of advanced chips in 2022—critical for modern electronics and military systems.  
  – Those chips largely travel by air, bypassing any naval blockade.  
b) Taiwanese Counter-Blockade Threat  
  – Taiwan’s domestically developed Ching Tien supersonic cruise missile can reach China’s five busiest ports (Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Shenzhen, Qingdao, Guangzhou), all within 1,000 miles.  
  – Experience in the Red Sea (Houthis vs. international shipping) shows how a small missile force can scare off insurers and carriers.  
c) Escalation to War  
  – Any Chinese blockade invites Taiwanese military retaliation, and likely U.S. or Japanese intervention to break it, risking a costly naval/air war for China without securing Taiwan.  
d) Geopolitical Backlash  
  – A blockade could prompt Taiwan or its allies to formally declare independence and abandon the One China Policy.  
  – Beijing risks undermining its own “peaceful reunification” narrative—a point underscored by Defense Minister Dong Jun’s recent complaint at the Shangri-La Dialogue that reunification prospects are “increasingly being eroded by separatists … and foreign forces.”

5. Conclusion  
Alperovitch concludes that a Chinese economic blockade of Taiwan would be self-defeating—hurting China’s economy, provoking military escalation, and triggering severe geopolitical fallout—and thus is unlikely to be China’s chosen path to coercion.

Disclaimer: Extraction appears complete based on the provided content.

Key facts and figures
• Speaker: Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe and Africa, nominee for NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe.  
• Context: Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, May 26, 2022.  
• Grain exports at risk: Ukraine is the world’s largest exporter of sunflower oil, fourth-largest exporter of corn, and fifth-largest exporter of wheat. Some 22 million tons of grain remain stuck in Ukrainian ports.  
• Russian naval blockade: According to U.S. intelligence, Russia’s navy effectively controls all traffic in the northern third of the Black Sea, blocking Ukrainian grain ships.  
• Loss estimates in Ukraine war (Pentagon): about 1,000 Russian tanks, 350 artillery pieces, 36 fighter-bomber aircraft and more than 50 helicopters destroyed; over 80 percent of Russia’s battalion tactical groups committed; Ukraine claims to have “expunged” nearly 30,000 Russian troops.  

Threats and potential interventions  
• Cavoli’s warning: Food shortages could empower terrorist groups (Islamic State, al-Shabab, Boko Haram), which “feed on weak governance, food insecurity, corruption and poverty.” He said U.S. military intervention “may” be required to prevent global market destabilization.  
• Transportation alternatives under way:  
  – Romania’s port of Constanța is handling up to 90,000 tons of Ukrainian grain per day.  
  – The “Berlin train lift”: German rail (Deutsche Bahn) moving Ukrainian grain via Poland to northern German ports.  
• U.S. stance on direct military involvement: Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said there are “no plans to use U.S. military… to assist in the movement of grain outside of Ukraine,” though discussions continue with allies.  

Diplomatic signals  
• Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov: No Ukrainian grain ships will leave until Western sanctions are lifted.  
• Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi: Reported that Putin “in principle” agreed to free several million tons of grain; Kremlin’s own readout did not confirm this.  
• British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss: Condemned Moscow for “weaponizing hunger” and rejected any sanctions relief, warning against appeasement.  
• Draghi’s proposal: A joint Russia-Ukraine demining effort, coupled with guarantees against attacks during clearance; he plans to consult Kyiv on the idea.  

Arms‐smuggling concerns  
• Cavoli acknowledged that large Western arms shipments to Ukraine carry a smuggling risk to illicit groups, posing future threats to U.S. interests. Accountability for equipment distribution is “vital” but “challenging,” especially given no U.S. military presence in Ukraine.  

Operational outlook in Ukraine  
• Russia’s strategy in Donbas: Western intelligence assesses a slow, grinding campaign centered on “encirclement efforts” to cut off Ukrainian defenders, notably around Severodonetsk.  
• Conflict status: Entering its fourth month, with Putin’s forces unable to achieve a quick victory, according to U.S. officials.  

Overall, Cavoli stressed a mix of civilian-led diplomatic, logistical and potential military options to address the Russian blockade of Ukrainian grain, while cautioning that more international coordination is needed to prevent global food insecurity and related security threats.

Here is a concise summary of the New York Times article “C.I.A. Director Says Kremlin ‘Appeared to Be Adrift’ During Aborted Mutiny” (July 20, 2023):

1. Context & Speaker  
   • William J. Burns, Director of the C.I.A., speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, delivered the most detailed public U.S. assessment of July’s Wagner Group mutiny.  

2. Kremlin Paralysis During Mutiny  
   • Burns said that for much of the 36-hour rebellion, Russian security services, the military and decision-makers “appeared to be adrift.”  
   • He quoted Russians asking, “Does the emperor have no clothes?” and “Why is it taking so long for him [Putin] to get dressed?”  
   • British MI6 Chief Richard Moore similarly remarked that the uprising revealed cracks in President Vladimir Putin’s rule.  

3. Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Role and Messaging  
   • Burns noted Prigozhin “made up some of the steps in the rebellion as he went along,” but his long-standing public critiques of Russian military leadership and war corruption “were hiding in plain sight.”  
   • A video Prigozhin posted on Telegram—challenging Russia’s rationale for invading Ukraine—reached about one-third of the Russian population. Burns called it “the most scathing indictment of Putin’s rationale for war…that I have heard.”  

4. U.S. Intelligence & Outlook  
   • Burns confirmed the U.S. had “some notice” the uprising might occur.  
   • He predicts Putin will try to preserve Wagner’s combat capabilities by separating the force from Prigozhin, and later “serve cold” revenge on Prigozhin (now in Minsk and Russia).  
   • U.S. officials believe General Sergei Surovikin had advance knowledge of the mutiny; Burns suggested Surovikin “doesn’t enjoy a lot of freedom right now.”  

5. Related Reporting on Russia’s Black Sea Campaign  
   • Russia stepped up air strikes on Ukrainian ports—key to global grain supplies—after exiting a U.N. grain-export agreement.  
   • John Kirby, National Security Council spokesman, accused Moscow of mining sea routes, preparing attacks on civilian ships, then blaming Ukraine in a “false-flag” operation.  
   • Russia released footage it said showed detonation of a Ukrainian mine; Ambassador Anatoly Antonov denied intentions to attack civilian vessels.  
   • Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense warned ships to/from Russian or occupied ports would be deemed carrying “military cargo.”  
   • Attacks destroyed 60,000 tons of grain in Chornomorsk; silos and port infrastructure in Mykolaiv and Odesa were hit, causing deaths, injuries and fires.  
   • Josep Borrell Fontelles (EU High Representative) warned of a looming global food crisis; U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the strikes as potential violations of international humanitarian law.

Summary of “U.S. intelligence document shows Russian naval blockade of Ukraine,” Shane Harris, The Washington Post, May 24, 2022

1. Objective facts and figures  
• Declassified U.S. intelligence shows that since Russia’s February 2022 invasion, its navy has effectively blockaded Ukraine’s northern Black Sea coast, halting all civil maritime traffic and entrapping agricultural exports.  
• Ukraine accounted for roughly 10 percent of global wheat exports in 2020, about 95 percent of which departed via Black Sea ports. It is also the world’s largest exporter of sunflower oil, the fourth-largest exporter of corn, and the fifth-largest exporter of wheat.  
• An estimated 20 million tons of wheat and other grains remain stuck in Ukraine, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  
• Lebanese bread prices have risen 70 percent since the blockade began; shipments from Odessa to Somalia have ceased.  
• Since February, Russia has closed the Kerch Strait, tightened control over the Sea of Azov, stationed warships off Ukrainian ports, and struck ports with missiles.  
• Ukrainian forces have sunk the Russian flagship Moskva, but commercial shipping remains in a “no-go zone.”  
• The European Commission has proposed exporting Ukrainian grain by rail, road, or river, but lacks clear means to protect those corridors.  
• Denmark plans to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles to Ukraine; it may take months to train Ukrainian crews.  
• Pre-war forecasts had 2022 as the most food-insecure year on record globally.  
• The World Food Program estimates the conflict could push 47 million more people into acute food insecurity.  

2. Statements by named, generally reliable sources  
• U.S. official (anonymously quoted): Russia’s blockade is “a deliberate attack on the global food supply chain,” entrapping exports and jeopardizing food security.  
• Ursula von der Leyen (European Commission president): Russia is “holding back supplies to increase global prices, or trading wheat in exchange for political support,” using grain as “blackmail.”  
• U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken (at the UN): The blockade is “a deliberate effort” by Russia to destabilize the world’s food supply.  
• Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (at Davos): Without export agreements, “there will be famine, there will be a catastrophe…a deficit, there will be a high price.”  
• Gen. Mark A. Milley (U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff): The U.S. has “no vessels in the Black Sea” and is resisting direct military involvement; the region is in stalemate.  
• Michael Carpenter (U.S. ambassador to OSCE): Russian forces have stolen 400,000 tons of Ukrainian wheat and farm equipment, and destroyed transportation infrastructure, worsening global shortages.  

3. Russia’s denials and alternative claims  
• Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov: Western sanctions, not Russia, have disrupted global food supplies; Ukraine has mined ports and refused to let vessels depart.  
• Middle East Institute (Washington think tank): Russia violated the Montreux Convention by using merchant ships to supply its navy and “stole Ukrainian grain on an industrial scale.”  

4. Impacts and concerns  
• The blockade threatens political stability in vulnerable states dependent on Ukrainian grain.  
• Western powers have limited options to force reopening of Ukrainian ports.  
• Military aid (e.g., anti-ship missiles) could help but may require months of training and integration.

<Perplexity_report>
Query: Please provide a timeline since 1945 of when the U.S. government publicly accused another country of conducting a maritime blockade. For each case, include the target nation, the language used in the accusation, the strategic or diplomatic context, and note any instances involving China or Taiwan-related maritime coercion.
# Timeline of U.S. Government Accusations of Maritime Blockades Since 1945  

The United States has historically engaged in maritime security discourse, including public accusations of blockades against other nations. Below is a detailed timeline of such instances, focusing on documented cases since 1945.  

---

## 1. **Black Sea Blockade Accusation Against Russia (February 2022)**  
### **Target Nation**: Russia  
### **Language Used**:  
The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv condemned Russia’s unilateral maritime restrictions as a continuation of "economic warfare" and "destabilizing behavior," asserting that Moscow’s actions "restrict Ukraine’s maritime sovereignty [and] limit freedom of navigation" under the pretext of military exercises[17].  
### **Strategic Context**:  
During Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine in early 2022, Moscow announced naval drills in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, effectively blockading Ukrainian ports. The U.S. framed this as part of Russia’s hybrid warfare strategy to destabilize Ukraine economically and militarily[17].  

---

## 2. **Accusation of Rehearsed Blockade Against Taiwan by China (April 2025)**  
### **Target Nation**: China  
### **Language Used**:  
The U.S. State Department accused China of conducting a "rehearsal blockade and attack" on Taiwan through military drills, emphasizing that such actions "put the region’s security at risk" and constituted "intimidation tactics"[16]. The Wall Street Journal reported U.S. concerns over China’s capability to enforce a blockade by encircling Taiwan with naval assets and severing undersea cables[8].  
### **Strategic Context**:  
Following increased PLA activity near Taiwan, including live-fire exercises and simulated strikes on ports, the U.S. framed China’s actions as coercive measures to isolate Taiwan economically and militarily. This aligned with broader U.S. efforts to counter China’s "legal warfare" tactics to legitimize blockades under international law[3][16].  

---

## 3. **Senkaku Islands Maritime Coercion (2010)**  
### **Target Nation**: China  
### **Language Used**:  
While the U.S. avoided explicitly using the term "blockade," then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reaffirmed that the Senkaku Islands fell under the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty, stating, "We have made it very clear that the islands are part of our mutual treaty obligations"[14].  
### **Strategic Context**:  
During the 2010 Senkaku crisis, China escalated maritime patrols near the disputed islands, prompting U.S. diplomatic support for Japan. Though not a formal blockade accusation, the U.S. positioned China’s actions as destabilizing and reaffirmed its commitment to countering coercive tactics in the East China Sea[14].  

---

## 4. **Yemeni Houthi Naval Blockade Expansion (March 2025)**  
### **Target Nation**: Houthi Forces (Yemen)  
### **Language Used**:  
The U.S. Department of Defense condemned Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi’s declaration of a naval blockade against American ships, characterizing it as an "escalation" that threatened "maritime security and global trade"[7].  
### **Strategic Context**:  
Amid Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, the U.S. accused the group of destabilizing regional navigation. While primarily a counterterrorism issue, the blockade rhetoric highlighted U.S. concerns over non-state actors employing naval coercion[7].  

---

## Analysis of China-Taiwan Maritime Coercion  
U.S. accusations against China over Taiwan-related blockades reflect a pattern of responding to PLA gray-zone tactics. For instance, in 2025, the U.S. highlighted China’s legal justifications for blockades, such as declaring exclusion zones or leveraging coast guard operations to interdict ships[3]. These accusations align with broader U.S. efforts to deter unilateral changes to the Taiwan Strait status quo, framing China’s actions as violations of international maritime norms[8][16].  

---

## Conclusion  
The U.S. has consistently framed maritime blockades as threats to global trade and regional stability, particularly in cases involving strategic rivals like Russia and China. Accusations often coincide with heightened military tensions, such as Russia’s Black Sea maneuvers or China’s Taiwan Strait drills. These cases underscore the interplay between naval coercion, international law, and great-power competition in U.S. foreign policy.

Summary of “Countering US Initiatives, Taiwan Crisis Complications” (Comparative Connections, Sept. 15 2022) by Robert G. Sutter and Chin-Hao Huang

1. Context and Chinese Objectives  
• Beijing’s primary goal in mid-2022 was to undercut U.S. influence in Southeast Asia and present China as the region’s stabilizer.  
• Efforts were framed under Xi Jinping’s two flagship programs:  
  – Global Development Initiative (launched May 2021)  
  – Global Security Initiative (announced April 2022 at the Boao Forum), described by Xi as promoting “common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security” and rejecting “Cold War mentality.”

2. Diplomatic and Economic Measures  
• High-level diplomacy:  
  – Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi led an intensive tour of ASEAN capitals and hosted Indonesia’s president in Beijing.  
  – Lobbying targeted endorsements of China’s Security and Development Initiatives by ASEAN and developing countries.  
• Economic inducements:  
  – Chinese aid commitments to Southeast Asia far outstripped the Biden administration’s $150 million pledge at the May 2022 US-ASEAN Summit.  
  – China emphasized the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), in contrast to the U.S.-backed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).

3. Security Engagement  
• Incremental to dramatic security pacts:  
  – May 2022 security agreement with the Solomon Islands.  
  – Proposed combined security/development pact with ten Pacific Island nations.  
• China’s narrative: the United States foments “divisive blocs,” while China offers “win-win cooperation.”

4. Countering U.S. Initiatives  
• US-ASEAN Summit (May 2022)  
  – Biden announced $150 million for regional aid and appointed a U.S. ambassador to ASEAN.  
  – Chinese media criticized the U.S. for small-scale offerings and lack of trade alternatives to RCEP.  
• Quad Summit & IPMDA (May 2022)  
  – The Quad (Australia, India, Japan, U.S.) pledged to defend a “rules-based order” and opposed coercion in the Indo-Pacific.  
  – The Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) was seen by China as targeting its fishing fleets.  
  – Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned the U.S. strategy “is bound to fail” due to regional concern over “Cold War–style” blocs.  
• IPEF (Oct 2021 launch)  
  – Official Chinese media, citing unnamed “experts,” labelled IPEF a “trade defensive measure” focused on export controls, import screening and supply-chain security to contain China.  

5. Taiwan-Centered Military Signaling  
• In August 2022, Chinese military exercises near Taiwan ramped up to “large-scale provocative shows of force.”  
• State media warnings explicitly linked these drills to U.S. support for Taiwan, complicating Beijing’s stabilizer image.

6. Russia-Ukraine Factors  
• China consistently opposed Western sanctions on Russia, lobbying ASEAN states to avoid backing U.S. measures.  
• Regional governments largely abstained from UN votes or criticism, reflecting caution over taking sides.

Notable Named Sources and Attributions  
• Asia Society: GSI “reinforces China’s image as ‘an empathetic friend of the global south…seeking greener and more balanced development.’”  
• Wang Yi (China’s FM): US “Indo-Pacific Strategy…is bound to fail.”  
• Unnamed Chinese media “experts”: IPEF is a defensive trade bloc.  

Key Takeaway  
In 2022, Beijing ramped up diplomatic, economic, and security initiatives across Southeast and Pacific Asia to counter perceived U.S. encroachment, while simultaneously employing military demonstrations around Taiwan to signal resolve—creating a tension between its claimed role as regional stabilizer and its coercive tactics.

<Summary source="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3299016/china-accuses-us-serious-backsliding-taiwan-change-website">
Here’s a concise summary of the February 17, 2025 SCMP article “China accuses US of ‘serious backsliding’ on Taiwan with change to website”:

• US State Department website update  
  – Washington said the recent change to its Taiwan-related web content does not reflect any “major change in US policy” toward the island.

• China’s Foreign Ministry reaction  
  – Spokesman Guo Jiakun (Feb. 17) called the update “a serious backsliding in the US stance on Taiwan-related issues” and said it violated the one-China principle.  
  – He warned it “sends a very wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces” and exemplifies the US “using Taiwan to contain China.”

• China’s demands of the US  
  – Immediately correct the website update and “earnestly uphold the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués.”  
  – Handle Taiwan‐related issues with great caution; stop using Taiwan to contain China; cease escalation of substantive US-Taiwan relations.  
  – End support for Taiwan’s efforts to expand its international presence.  
  – Avoid further damage to US-China relations and to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.
</Summary>

<Summary source="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/sanctioning-china-in-a-taiwan-crisis-scenarios-and-risks/">
This report (Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Center & Rhodium Group, June 22 2023) examines how G 7 countries might use sanctions and other economic tools in a Taiwan crisis short of full-scale war. It is based on in-person roundtables in the U.S., EU, and U.K., interviews with G 7 policymakers and experts, and independent economic analysis.

1. Context and Rising Risks  
- Long-standing economic interdependence across the Taiwan Strait helped deter conflict, but “guardrails” have weakened due to:  
  • Intensifying U.S.-China geopolitical competition  
  • China’s stepped-up military and economic pressure on Taiwan  
  • Beijing’s harsh crackdown in Hong Kong  
  • Shifting Taiwanese identity and politics  
- Taiwan’s presidential election (early 2024) and political uncertainties in Washington and Beijing further raise escalation risks.

2. Global Economic Stakes  
- Rhodium Group (Dec 14 2022) estimates over $2 trillion of global economic activity faces direct disruption each year from a Taiwan blockade – likely an underestimate. [1]  
- Nikkei Asia (Aug 22 2022) warned up to $2.6 trillion could evaporate from the global economy in a Taiwan emergency. [4]  
- Potential impacts include widespread goods shortages, mass unemployment, and financial instability.

3. Precedent: G 7 Response to Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine  
- Rapid, coordinated sanctions on Russia demonstrated the range of economic statecraft tools: financial sanctions, export controls, asset freezes, secondary sanctions.  
- Sanctions goals evolved from deterrence by punishment to degrading Russia’s military-sustaining capacity and signaling G 7 unity.

4. Emerging Proposals and Policymaker Views  
- U.S. lawmakers have introduced the STAND with Taiwan Act of 2023 (S. Res. 1027), mandating sanctions on China if it invades Taiwan. [2]  
- Surveys (German Marshall Fund & Bertelsmann Foundation, Sept 2022) show a growing, though still minority, willingness among Europeans to sanction China for military action against Taiwan. [3]  
- Reports suggest China’s State Council is assessing the risk of Western sanctions in a Taiwan crisis. [4]  
- Major banks and multinational corporations are conducting contingency planning around potential cross-strait sanctions.

5. Types and Objectives of Economic Countermeasures  
- “Economic countermeasures” encompass financial sanctions, export controls, investment restrictions, and other barriers to trade or capital flows.  
- Key objectives may include:  
  a. Deterrence by punishment (threat of punitive measures before or after aggression)  
  b. Deterrence by denial (blocking access to critical technologies or resources)  
  c. Degradation (weakening an adversary’s ability or will to sustain aggression)  
  d. Signaling alliance cohesion and resolve  
- The U.S. already maintains export controls on dual-use and military technologies for China, partly aimed at deterring any future cross-strait aggression.

6. Coordination Challenges in a Taiwan Crisis  
- China’s economy is roughly ten times larger and far more globally integrated than Russia’s, complicating unified G 7 action.  
- Potential spillovers to G 7 economies and global supply chains raise questions about willingness to impose—and endure—the necessary economic pain.  
- Effective sanctions would require agreement on scope (financial, sectoral, secondary), timing, enforcement, and burden-sharing among G 7 members.

7. Report’s Purpose and Next Steps  
- This “first look” provides data-driven estimates of economic impacts, inventories of possible sanction tools, and an outline of coordination hurdles.  
- Understanding these scenarios is vital for policymakers and businesses to weigh costs, design credible deterrence signals, and prepare contingency plans.

Here is a structured summary of the CBC/Associated Press article “In major military exercise, China simulates sealing off Taiwan’s ports,” published October 14, 2024:

1. Objective facts and figures  
  • Date & scope: Single-day PLA exercise on October 14, 2024, simulating the “sealing off” of Taiwan’s ports.  
  • Forces involved:  
    – 125 aircraft (record high): 90 of them—warplanes, helicopters, drones—entered Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) from 5:02 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. local time (Taiwan Ministry of National Defence).  
    – Liaoning aircraft carrier deployed; J-15 fighter jets seen operating from its deck (CCTV).  
    – PLA navy, army air force, missile corps mobilized in an integrated operation (Eastern Theatre Command).  
  • Drill area: Six large maritime zones encircling Taiwan and its outlying islands, focused on key strategic locations (Taiwan Ministry of National Defence; CCTV map).  
  • Taiwan’s response deployments:  
    – Warships stationed at designated ocean spots for surveillance.  
    – Mobile missile and radar units on land tracking PLA vessels.  
    – As of Monday morning, tracked 25 Chinese warplanes, seven warships, four government ships (Taiwan Ministry of National Defence).  
  • Civilian impact: Shipping traffic reported as normal; Taipei residents interviewed said they felt neither panic nor impact.  

2. Named opinions and statements (reliable sources)  
  • PLA Eastern Theatre Command, Senior Captain Li Xi:  
    “This is a major warning to those who back Taiwan independence and a signifier of our determination to safeguard our national sovereignty.”  
  • Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning:  
    “Taiwan independence is as incompatible with peace in the Taiwan Strait as fire with water. Provocation by the Taiwan independence forces will surely be met with countermeasures.”  
  • Taiwan Ministry of National Defence & Presidential Office:  
    – Condemned drills as military provocations undermining regional peace and Taiwan’s democracy.  
    – Joseph Wu (Secretary-General, Taiwan’s National Security Council): “Threatening other countries with force violates the basic spirit of the United Nations Charter to resolve disputes through peaceful means.”  
  • U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller:  
    “We call on [Beijing’s government] to act with restraint and to avoid any further actions that may undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the broader region.”  

3. Additional context and related actions  
  • Timing: Exercises followed Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s National Day speech (Oct 10) rejecting China’s “one China” demand, and come four days after Taiwan’s National Day celebrations.  
  • Sanctions announced by China’s Taiwan Affairs Office against two Taiwanese individuals—Puma Shen (co-founder of Kuma Academy) and Robert Tsao (US$32.8 million donor)—for “promoting Taiwanese independence.” They are barred from traveling to China (including Hong Kong).  
  • Historical precedent: Similar large-scale PLA drills, including a simulated blockade, occurred in 2022 after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit.

<Summary source="https://www.voanews.com/a/china-starts-new-round-of-war-games-near-taiwan-offers-no-end-date-/7821267.html">
Here is a concise summary of the VOA article “China conducts military exercises around Taiwan aimed at ‘deterring separatist forces’” (Oct. 13, 2024):

Facts and developments  
• On Oct. 13, China’s Eastern Theater Command launched “Joint Sword-2024 B,” a joint PLA exercise in waters north, south and east of Taiwan and at the northern end of the Taiwan Strait.  
• The drills included sea-air combat-readiness patrols and simulations of blockading key ports and assaulting maritime and ground targets.  
• At 6 p.m. local time the PLA announced the exercise had concluded, saying it had “fully tested the integrated joint operation capabilities of its troops” and would continue strengthening combat readiness.  

Official statements  
• Li Xi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command, called the exercise “a stern warning to the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces” and “a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding state sovereignty and national unity.”  
• Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense condemned the drills as “irrational and provocative,” vowed to defend Taiwan’s democracy, freedom and sovereignty, and warned they “intensify tension and damage peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”  
• U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington is “seriously concerned” by the PLA drills, called them “unwarranted” and “risk escalation,” and pledged to monitor PRC activities and coordinate with allies and partners.  

Analysis and expert views (all from named sources in the article)  
• Chieh Chung (Association of Strategic Foresight, Taiwan): The PLA is simulating how to cut off Taiwan’s air and sea traffic, prevent Taiwan’s forces from mobilizing and ultimately impose a total blockade by staging drills corresponding to all of Taiwan’s key ports.  
• Lin Ying-yu (Tamkang University): By sending the carrier Liaoning through the Bashi Channel toward the Pacific, China may be rehearsing area-denial and counter-intervention against a potential U.S. carrier-strike group.  
• Lev Nachman (National Taiwan University): Such military intimidation rarely erodes Taiwanese support for the ruling DPP; instead, it tends to worsen China’s image among South Korea, Japan and other regional states.  
• Lin (Tamkang) also noted Beijing may be testing Washington’s ability to respond simultaneously to crises in the Taiwan Strait and rising North Korean threats to South Korea.  
• Nachman added that, because Taiwan President Lai Ching-te’s National Day speech was less provocative than his inauguration address, Taipei might focus on targeted responses rather than broader escalation.  

Context  
• These exercises follow President Lai Ching-te’s Oct. 10 National Day speech rejecting PRC claims over Taiwan and reiterating that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People’s Republic of China are not subordinate to one another.  
• It is the second “blockade-style” exercise around Taiwan in 2024; a similar drill occurred after Lai’s inauguration in May, framed by Beijing as punishment for “separatist acts.”  
• China views Taiwan as its territory and has threatened to reunify by force if necessary; under Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party government, Beijing has stepped up military pressure via air and naval incursions and blockade-style drills.

   - Quality: Contains useful examples but should be treated cautiously as AI-generated content.
   - Facts vs. Opinions: Mixes factual reporting with interpretations that require verification.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several possible reference classes for this question:

1. **Historical U.S. accusations of maritime blockades** (general): The Perplexity report indicates these are relatively rare, with notable cases including Russia's Black Sea blockade of Ukraine (2022) and alleged Chinese "rehearsal blockade" of Taiwan (April 2025).

2. **U.S.-China interactions regarding Taiwan's maritime security**: This includes diplomatic statements about Chinese naval exercises around Taiwan and characterizations of coercive actions.

3. **Economic/shipping disruptions labeled as "blockades"**: How the U.S. characterizes actions that disrupt maritime commerce but fall short of traditional military blockades.

4. **Gray-zone maritime coercion**: Cases where nations use sub-blockade tactics that still significantly impact maritime traffic.

**Most suitable reference class**: U.S. diplomatic characterizations of Chinese naval actions around Taiwan. This provides the most direct parallel to the forecasting question, particularly the alleged April 2025 "rehearsal blockade" accusation mentioned in the Perplexity report.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is from May 6, 2025, to July 1, 2025 – approximately 56 days.

Key timing considerations:
- The Perplexity report suggests a very recent U.S. accusation (April 2025) of China conducting a "rehearsal blockade" of Taiwan.
- Historical Taiwan Strait crises have typically unfolded over weeks to months.
- The 2024 article references China's "Joint Sword 2024 A" exercise that nearly encircled Taiwan, suggesting a pattern of escalating military activities.
- The short timeframe (56 days) requires focusing on imminent possibilities rather than long-term trends.

## (d) Justification:

Integrating these analyses, several factors inform my outside view prediction:

1. **Recent precedent**: If accurate, the April 2025 "rehearsal blockade" accusation mentioned in the Perplexity report suggests the U.S. has already employed blockade terminology regarding Taiwan very recently.

2. **Threshold for accusation**: The question requires a formal U.S. accusation specifically characterizing Chinese actions as a "blockade" of at least one Taiwanese seaport – a specific diplomatic threshold.

3. **Expert assessment of blockade likelihood**: Alperovitch's 2024 analysis argues China would avoid an actual blockade because it would:
   - Damage China's own economy due to semiconductor dependencies
   - Risk Taiwanese counter-blockade capabilities against mainland ports
   - Likely trigger U.S./Japanese military intervention
   - Undermine China's "peaceful reunification" narrative

4. **U.S. precedent for blockade accusations**: As demonstrated in the Ukraine context, the U.S. government has recently shown willingness to formally characterize maritime disruptions as "blockades."

5. **Accusation vs. reality distinction**: The question only requires a U.S. accusation, not an effective military blockade – a lower threshold than actual implementation.

# Outside view calibration:

My calibration considers:

1. The base rate of U.S. accusations of blockades appears relatively low historically.

2. If the Perplexity report is accurate about an April 2025 "rehearsal blockade" accusation, this significantly increases the probability as it suggests:
   - The terminology threshold has been recently crossed
   - Tensions may already be elevated
   - The accusation language is in active diplomatic usage

3. The 56-day window is relatively short, which would normally reduce probability, but given the reported recent accusation, timing actually increases likelihood.

4. Expert assessment (Alperovitch) suggests China would be strategically irrational to implement an actual blockade, but the question only requires an accusation, not implementation.

5. Historical U.S. willingness to formally accuse Russia of blockading Ukraine provides a recent precedent for such terminology.

Considering these factors, particularly the alleged April 2025 "rehearsal blockade" accusation (which requires verification), I estimate a 31% probability of the U.S. accusing China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **First Taiwan Strait Crisis (Wikipedia)**: 
   - Provides historical context of the 1954-1955 conflict between PRC and ROC
   - Details US involvement including the deployment of the Seventh Fleet
   - Quality: Moderate - disclaimer indicates incomplete extraction
   - Contains factual information about military actions and diplomatic responses
   - Relevance: Provides historical precedent but from nearly 70 years ago

2. **"A Chinese Blockade of Taiwan" (USNI, 1984)**:
   - Analysis from 1984 arguing blockade was more plausible than invasion
   - Contains outdated naval force assessments
   - Quality: Low for current prediction - strategic analysis from 40 years ago
   - Relevance: Demonstrates longstanding consideration of blockade scenarios

3. **"A Chinese Economic Blockade of Taiwan Would Fail or Launch a War" (War on the Rocks, 2024)**:
   - Recent expert analysis by Dmitri Alperovitch
   - Documents "Joint Sword 2024 A" exercises that nearly encircled Taiwan
   - Presents strategic arguments against China implementing a blockade
   - Quality: High - recent expert analysis from credible security publication
   - Relevance: Directly addresses likelihood and feasibility of Chinese blockade

4. **Russian Naval Blockade Articles (Washington Post, 2022 & NYT, 2023)**:
   - Detail US accusations against Russia regarding Ukraine grain blockade
   - Show specific language used by US officials in characterizing blockades
   - Quality: High - factual reporting from reputable sources
   - Relevance: Provide recent precedent for how US formally characterizes blockades

5. **Perplexity Report on US Blockade Accusations**:
   - Timeline of US accusations of maritime blockades since 1945
   - Notes US accusation of a "rehearsed blockade" by China in April 2025
   - Quality: Medium - AI-generated compilation without clear citation methodology
   - Relevance: High if accurate - suggests very recent escalation in US-China tensions

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

1. **Historical Chinese military actions regarding Taiwan**:
   - First, Second, and Third Taiwan Strait Crises (1954-1996)
   - Recent military exercises surrounding Taiwan
   - Suitability: Moderate - shows patterns of Chinese coercion but not US accusations

2. **US accusations of naval blockades**:
   - Russian blockade of Ukraine (2022-present)
   - Reported accusation of Chinese "rehearsed blockade" (April 2025)
   - Suitability: High - demonstrates US threshold and language for blockade accusations

3. **Current US-China tensions regarding Taiwan (2024-2025)**:
   - Most recent military exercises and diplomatic statements
   - Reported April 2025 "rehearsed blockade" accusation
   - Suitability: Highest - most directly relevant to forecasting question

I'll primarily use the third reference class while incorporating elements from the second.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- We're examining a narrow 56-day window (May 6 - July 1, 2025)
- If the Perplexity report is accurate, tension appears already elevated with a "rehearsed blockade" accusation in April 2025
- "Joint Sword 2024 A" exercise naming convention suggests more exercises may follow
- Historical blockade accusations (e.g., Russia/Ukraine) show they typically follow observable maritime restrictions

## (d) Justification

Several factors influence this forecast:

1. **Recent accusations**: If the US already accused China of a "rehearsed blockade" in April 2025, this represents significant escalation in rhetoric but falls short of accusing an actual blockade.

2. **Chinese strategic disincentives**: Alperovitch's analysis presents strong arguments against China implementing an actual blockade:
   - Economic self-harm through disruption of semiconductor supply chains
   - Risk of Taiwanese counter-blockade of mainland ports
   - Probable escalation to direct military conflict with the US/Japan
   - Severe geopolitical backlash undermining "peaceful reunification" narrative

3. **US accusation threshold**: Based on the Russia/Ukraine precedent, the US requires clear evidence of maritime traffic obstruction to formally accuse a nation of blockade.

4. **Timeline constraints**: While the 56-day window is relatively short, naval operations can be implemented rapidly if political decisions are made.

5. **Historical precedent**: Despite multiple crises since 1949, China has never implemented a full blockade of Taiwan's ports, suggesting significant restraint.

# Outside view calibration:

Starting with base rates, China has never fully blockaded Taiwan's ports in 75+ years of tensions. However, military exercises and "gray zone" activities have increased in recent years.

The reported April 2025 "rehearsed blockade" accusation (if accurate) represents significant escalation. This suggests tensions are already higher than historical norms during our forecast period.

The strategic disincentives analyzed by Alperovitch remain compelling - a blockade would likely harm China more than Taiwan while risking wider conflict. This suggests China would be reluctant to implement actions that would prompt a formal US blockade accusation.

Calibrating across these factors:
- Low historical base rate (full blockade has never occurred)
- Recent escalation in tensions and exercises
- Strategic disincentives for China
- Short timeframe (56 days)
- Specific requirement for US government accusation of actual (not rehearsed) blockade

# Outside View Prediction:
19%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
  a. Wikipedia “First Taiwan Strait Crisis” (1954–55)  
    • Type: General historical overview. Reliable for broad facts, limited on interpretation.  
    • Factual points: U.S. Seventh Fleet intervention, mutual defense treaty, no full blockade of Taiwan proper—only shelling of offshore islands.  
    • Opinion/fact separation: Largely factual chronology, minimal author opinion.  
  b. U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, Sept. 1984 (“A Chinese Blockade of Taiwan”)  
    • Type: Professional‐military journal article. Authoritative on force structure and strategic logic, but dated.  
    • Factual points: PRC force composition in 1984, past PLA focus on offshore islands, blockade seen as more feasible option than invasion.  
    • Opinions: Author’s judgment that a blockade would be “plausible” and “less costly” than invasion—expert‐opinion but not a forecast.  
  c. Dmitri Alperovitch, War on the Rocks (June 5, 2024)  
    • Type: Think‐tank analysis by a recognized cyber/security expert.  
    • Factual points: PLA “Joint Sword 2024 A” near-encirclement drills; Taiwan’s missile counter-blockade capability; air freight channeling of semiconductors.  
    • Opinions: Alperovitch’s view that a Chinese blockade would “almost certainly fail” or trigger war—expert opinion that blockade is unlikely.

    • Type: Mainstream journalism citing official statements. Reliable on Russia’s Black Sea control.  
    • Factual points: Russia’s effective naval interdiction of Ukrainian ports; U.S. public condemnation; global food insecurity impact.  
    • Opinions: Policymaker warnings about broader security risks—clearly tagged as their views.  
  e. Perplexity Report: Timeline of U.S. Accusations of Blockades since 1945  
    • Type: AI‐aggregated summary with mixed sourcing. Contains plausible events (Russia 2022; April 2025 “rehearsal blockade” accusation of China; 2010 Senkaku; 2025 Houthi).  
    • Reliability concerns: The April 2025 “rehearsal blockade” citation may be drawn from press reports and needs independent corroboration.  
    • Factual vs. opinion: Mostly factual—quotations of U.S. statements—but some events (e.g. “rehearsal blockade”) need verification.

2. Reference‐class analysis  
  • Candidate classes:  
    1. U.S. public accusations of maritime blockades by any actor since 1945.  
       – Historical frequency: ~4 well‐documented cases over 80 years (1945–2025), i.e. ~0.05 events/year.  
       – Suitability: Very narrow, but best matches the “accuse someone of blockade” criterion.  
    2. Instances of PRC gray-zone maritime coercion in the Taiwan Strait.  
       – Frequency: Regular (multiple drills per year).  
       – But these rarely provoke explicit “blockade” accusations—more “provocative drills.”  
    3. U.S. statements formally calling out PRC actions that threaten Taiwan’s maritime access (broad gray‐zone incidents).  
       – Frequency: Several per year, but seldom use the word “blockade.”  
  • Chosen reference class: (1) U.S. public accusations of blockade by any country—low frequency, directly comparable.

3. Timeframe analysis  
  • Forecast horizon: 56 days (May 6 to July 1, 2025).  
  • Historical patterns: Genuine blockades (or blockade‐style actions) have been crisis‐driven and rare.  
  • Short‐term risks: Unless a dramatic crisis erupts around Taiwan’s ports, a full blockade is improbable in <2 months.

4. Other considerations  
  • Political cycles: U.S. presidential election over, Biden is in a lame-duck period—less domestic pressure to escalate.  
  • China’s calculus: A real blockade risks triggering U.S. military intervention and regional war; PRC likely to avoid full blockade absent extreme provocation.  
  • U.S. signaling: The U.S. already labels certain drills “rehearsal blockades,” but these do not involve actual port closures without consent. Under the question’s strict criteria (ports blocked without Taiwanese consent), no event so far qualifies.  
  • Expert views: Alperovitch and analysts deem a blockade self-defeating for China; U.S. policymakers have voiced concern but stopped short of accusing an actual blockade.

Justification for outside view prediction  
  • Base‐rate inference: 4 accusations in 80 years → 5% chance in any given year → ~0.8% in 56 days.  
  • Adjustment for heightened tension: China–Taiwan/US relations are more fraught than Cold War average, but still blockade is extreme (escalation barrier).   
  • Upside adjustment: PRC gray-zone tactics might slip into limited port closure drills misinterpreted as blockade → small boost.   
  • Downside adjustment: High stakes deter PRC from real blockade; U.S. reluctant to brand routine drills an actual blockade under fine‐print criteria.  
  • Combined: 0.8% base rate × ~6× “tension multiplier” = ~5%. Slight further rounding for uncertainties → ~7%.

Outside view calibration:  
Given the very low base rate of U.S. blockade accusations (~4 over 80 years), the short remaining time (56 days), and the high risk China attaches to an actual blockade, my outside‐view probability is in the single‐digit percentile. After allowing generously for current tensions and occasional ambiguous “drills,” I arrive at ~7%.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 7% chance that the United States will publicly accuse the People’s Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. First Taiwan Strait Crisis (Wikipedia summary)  
      – Content: Describes 1954–55 shelling of offshore islands, U.S. naval deployments, but no PRC blockade of Taiwan’s main seaports and no U.S. accusation of such.  
      – Quality: Solid high‐level tertiary source for context; facts about troop movements and diplomatic treaties are reliable. Opinions are minimal.  
   b. “A Chinese Blockade of Taiwan” (U.S. Naval Institute, 1984)  
      – Content: Analytical piece arguing that a future PRC blockade of Taiwan would be more plausible than invasion. No actual blockade occurred; the article is forward‐looking.  
      – Quality: Expert‐written but dated (1984). Mixes fact (force‐structure data) with normative analysis (author’s recommendation). Use strictly for conceptual understanding, not event frequency.  
   c. War on the Rocks, June 2024 (Dmitri Alperovitch)  
      – Content: Argues a PRC economic (or naval) blockade “would fail” and is therefore unlikely. Contains expert opinion drawing on Taiwan’s semiconductor exports and missile threat.  
      – Quality: Credible author but opinionated—treat as expert judgment rather than hard fact.  
   d. U.S. intelligence on Russian Black Sea blockade (Washington Post, May 2022) & related NYT/Cavoli reporting  
      – Content: Russia’s navy effectively blockaded Ukrainian ports; the U.S. publicly condemned it as “economic warfare” and “deliberate attack on global food supply.”  
      – Quality: High‐quality reporting, based on declassified intelligence and public statements by U.S. officials. Factual assertions about the blockade are strong; U.S. characterizations of intent blend fact and official rhetoric.  
   e. Perplexity report on “Timeline since 1945 of U.S. accusations of maritime blockades”  
      – Content: Lists four public U.S. blockade accusations: Russia (2022), China “rehearsal blockade” (April 2025), Senkaku‐related rhetoric (2010), Houthis (March 2025).  
      – Quality: Aggregates from multiple outlets. Contains some verifiable items (Russia 2022) and some secondary or anecdotal claims (China rehearsal, Houthis). Good starting point but each claim needs independent corroboration.

2. Reference‐class analysis  
   a. US public accusations of state‐level blockades since 1945  
      – N≈2 clear instances (Russia‐Ukraine 2022; U.S. threat language toward China drills in April 2025 if accepted).  
      – Suitability: Very small sample—low statistical power.  
   b. US public condemnations of Chinese “gray‐zone” maritime coercion (2019–2025)  
      – Multiple statements per year by State Dept./Pentagon calling out “harassment,” “encirclement drills,” and occasionally “rehearsal blockade.”  
      – Suitability: Reflects US rhetorical use of “blockade” language with PRC even absent an actual port closure. Gives a higher‐frequency baseline for “accusation of blockade” as diplomatic language.  
   c. Historical frequency of actual maritime blockades used as coercion among great powers  
      – Blockades are rare outside formal wars. Modern peacetime blockades virtually non‐existent.  
      – Suitability: Helps gauge true underlying event probability (an actual blockade)—very low.

   Most suitable reference class for an “outside view” is (c): actual blockades by one great power of another’s port in peacetime or gray‐zone context.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Today is May 6, 2025; question closes July 1, 2025 (≈56 days).  
   – Historical peacetime blockades have typically accompanied overt hostilities or formal state of war and have not been launched on ~2-month notice absent a major crisis.  
   – By contrast, Russia imposed its Black Sea “blockade” within days of invading Ukraine, but that was a full‐scale war. There is no parallel war between PRC and ROC.  
   – China’s last major Taiwan Strait blockade threat was a hypothetical in 1984; in the interim, PLA has never executed a true blockade of Taiwan’s ports.

4. Justification for outside view prediction  
   – Actual blockades are rare in the modern era outside declared wars. PRC has repeatedly conducted gray‐zone drills but has refrained from fully sealing ports, recognizing the economic backlash (semiconductors) and Taiwan’s counter‐strike threat.  
   – U.S. willingness to use “blockade” language rhetorically is higher (ref. class b), but question demands an accusation of a real, unauthorized port blockade.  
   – Expert opinion (Alperovitch 2024) and PLA force‐structure analysis (USNI 1984) both argue a true blockade is unlikely—it would be self‐defeating, risk U.S./Japanese intervention, and destabilize Xi’s “peaceful reunification” narrative.  
   – Tensions have risen (Joint Sword 2024), and U.S. has signaled it will condemn any blockade. But PRC has so far opted for encirclement drills short of closing seaports.  
   – With only ~8 weeks left and no sign of an imminent port sealing operation, the outside‐view probability of PRC executing an actual blockade, and the U.S. publicly accusing it, remains low.

Outside view calibration:

   – Base‐rate estimate from reference class (c): Peacetime blockades by a great power against a near peer in 80 years ≈ 1–2 events (Russia 2022, arguably U.S. blockade of Cuba in early Cold War but that was earlier) → ~1.5% per decade.  
   – Compressed timeframe (2 months) scales the rate down by ~1/60 of a decade → ~0.03% baseline.  
   – But heightened tensions and gray‐zone doctrine on both sides increase the chance above zero; experts still see blockades as improbable but not impossible.  
   – Adjust for elevated Sino-US tensions and recent drills → upward shift to the mid‐single digits.  
   – Weighing these factors yields an outside‐view probability around 5%.

Outside View Prediction:

   I assign a 5% chance that the U.S. will publicly accuse the People’s Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan’s seaports without Taipei’s consent before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Wikipedia summary of First Taiwan Strait Crisis, 1954-55  
   • Factual content: dates, U.S. treaty actions, PLA bombardment.  
   • Opinion content: none.  
   • Quality: solid overview, but secondary, not contemporary to 2025.  

2. U.S. Naval Institute “A Chinese Blockade of Taiwan” (1984)  
   • Factual: PLA order-of-battle, author’s assessment that blockade is likelier than invasion.  
   • Opinion: the author’s judgment about PLA preferences.  
   • Quality: professional military journal, but 40-year-old data; useful only for long-term context.  

3. War on the Rocks, Alperovitch (June 2024)  
   • Factual: description of April-May 2024 PLA “Joint Sword 2024-A” exercise.  
   • Opinion: author argues a blockade would fail and is therefore unlikely.  
   • Quality: high; author is a well-known geopolitical analyst, but still an informed opinion piece.  

4. Washington Post & NY Times material on Russia’s 2022 grain blockade of Ukraine  
   • Factual: U.S. officials publicly used the term “blockade” with respect to Russia.  
   • Opinion: statements that the blockade was “deliberate economic warfare.”  
   • Quality: major newspapers quoting senior U.S. officials—good evidence that the U.S. does sometimes issue blockade accusations, and of the language it uses.  

5. Perplexity “timeline” report  
   • Factual snippets: 2022 Russia case; alleged 2025 U.S. accusation that China “rehearsed” a blockade; 2025 Houthi threat.  
   • Opinion: mixture of paraphrased headlines; some items (esp. 2025 China accusation) cannot yet be verified by primary sources.  
   • Quality: aggregation of secondary sources; needs fact-checking.  For an outside-view baseline we note only that U.S. blockade accusations have been rare but do occur (e.g., Russia 2022).  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Potential reference classes:  
R1. All instances since 1945 in which the U.S. government publicly accused any country of imposing a maritime blockade (≈10 identifiable cases: Berlin Airlift era Soviet Baltic closure 1948; Cuban Missile Crisis 1962—reverse accusation; Egypt’s Suez 1967; Iran in the Gulf 1988; Iraq vs. Kuwait 1990; Serbia on Croatian ports 1991; Israel vs. Gaza 2010; Russia vs. Ukraine 2014 & 2022; Houthi Red Sea 2023-25). Rough rate ≈10 events / 80 years ≈0.125 events yr⁻¹.  

R2. U.S. accusations specifically involving China and Taiwan (zero well-documented cases since 1949).  

R3. U.S. accusations of any PRC gray-zone coercion short of blockade (air-defense-identification-zone declarations, danger-close exercises) ≈3–4 times in 10 years, but none labelled “blockade.”  

Suitability: R2 is the exact target phenomenon but frequency is zero; it risks giving us a degenerate 0 % base rate.  R1 captures the generic act of a U.S. “blockade accusation” and is therefore preferred for an outside view, then down-weighted for the specificity that the target must be China-vs-Taiwan.  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days remaining until deadline: 56 days (≈0.15 yr).  
If the background annual frequency of a U.S. blockade accusation is λ ≈ 0.125 yr⁻¹ (R1), then the naïve Poisson probability over 0.15 yr is  
P = 1 – e^(–λt) ≈ 1 – e^(–0.0188) ≈ 1.9 %.  
However, the “China-vs-Taiwan” filter is much more restrictive: historically 0/80 years → we expect a lower empirical likelihood; still, geopolitical tension is currently elevated compared with the 80-year average.  

(d) Justification (outside-view logic)  
• Base-rate: ≈2 % from generic blockade-accusation frequency.  
• Target-specific discount: Only a subset of blockade accusations deal with a great-power peer acting against a major U.S. partner in the Indo-Pacific.  Empirically that subset is tiny (0 recorded).  Apply a 0.25× multiplier → 0.5 %.  
• Contemporary-tension uplift: 2024-25 has seen markedly higher PLA activity around Taiwan than the long-run average.  Assume a 3× escalation factor to compensate for the unusually charged environment → 1.5 %.  
• Rounding to 1 % precision and acknowledging uncertainty bands, an outside-view forecast of roughly 2 % is defensible but a shade lower (1–2 %) reflects both historical rarity and short time left.  I choose the midpoint: 1.5 %.  

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: Poisson estimate from long-run frequency ≈1.9 %.  
Adjust down for “must involve PRC vs. Taiwan” (×0.25) =0.5 %.  
Adjust up for present heightened tension (×3) =1.5 %.  
No reliable betting market exists, so no additional tether.  
Therefore calibrated outside-view probability =1.5 %.

Outside View Prediction:
1.5 %

   - Facts vs. Opinions: Mix of factual reporting and attributed expert analysis from named academics.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**

- **PLA Explicitly Simulated Port Blockades (Oct. 2024)**: Multiple sources confirm China conducted exercises specifically "simulating the sealing off of Taiwan's ports" with 125 aircraft (record high) and naval forces encircling Taiwan in six maritime zones. This language directly parallels "blockade" terminology.

- **Expert Assessment of Blockade Rehearsal**: Chieh Chung (Association of Strategic Foresight, Taiwan) stated the PLA was "simulating how to cut off Taiwan's air and sea traffic" and "impose a total blockade by staging drills corresponding to all of Taiwan's key ports" (VOA article).

**Moderate Evidence:**

- **Escalating Pattern of PLA Activities**: Multiple sources document increasingly aggressive Chinese military activities throughout 2024, with record numbers of aircraft incursions and increasingly comprehensive naval deployments around Taiwan.

- **U.S. Official Condemnation**: State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller called the October 2024 exercises "unwarranted" and warned they "risk escalation" - demonstrating U.S. willingness to publicly condemn Chinese military activities.

- **Recent Diplomatic Tensions**: February 2025 dispute over U.S. State Department website shows continuing high-level friction specifically regarding Taiwan policy.

**Weak Evidence:**

- **Absence of "Blockade" Term in U.S. Statements**: While the U.S. has condemned Chinese exercises, none of the sources indicate the U.S. has yet used the specific term "blockade" to characterize China's actions around Taiwan.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window spans 56 days (May 6 - July 1, 2025).

Key timeframe considerations:
- Most recent information is from February 2025, leaving a 3-month information gap.
- The October 2024 port-sealing simulations occurred ~7 months before the prediction window begins.

If the timeframe were halved (28 days): The probability would decrease by ~5-7% as there would be less time for escalation to reach the "blockade accusation" threshold.

If the timeframe were doubled (112 days): The probability would increase by ~8-10% due to more opportunities for provocative Chinese actions and U.S. diplomatic responses.

## (d) Justification:

Combining the evidence, several factors influence my prediction:

1. China has already explicitly simulated port blockades in large-scale military exercises, creating a precedent and demonstrating capability.

2. There's a documented pattern of escalating PLA activities around Taiwan throughout 2024, with each exercise becoming more comprehensive.

3. Diplomatic tensions specifically regarding Taiwan policy continued at least through February 2025.

4. For resolution, we need both: (a) China to implement actual port-blocking operations beyond simulations, and (b) U.S. officials to specifically characterize this as a "blockade" - a specific diplomatic threshold.

5. The 56-day window is relatively short, somewhat limiting the probability of such a sequence occurring.

The base rate for formal U.S. blockade accusations appears low historically. The sources don't indicate any previous U.S. accusations of China blockading Taiwan, suggesting this would be a significant escalation in diplomatic terminology.

# Probability Calibration

Starting with a base rate of approximately 15% (given the historical rarity of formal blockade accusations in U.S.-China relations regarding Taiwan), I adjust based on the evidence:

- China's explicit simulation of port-sealing (+12%): This significantly increases probability as it demonstrates capability and intent.
- Pattern of escalating PLA activities (+7%): Suggests continued escalation is plausible.
- Continued diplomatic tensions through February 2025 (+3%): Indicates persistent political tensions.
- The relatively short 56-day window (-5%): Limits time for new escalations to develop.

This brings my estimated probability to 32%.

However, I need to consider that the resolution requires a specific diplomatic characterization ("blockade"), not just military action. The U.S. might be cautious about using such terminology given its international legal implications. Additionally, the timeframe begins over 6 months after the most recent documented port-sealing simulations, allowing time for tensions to potentially subside.

These considerations lead me to slightly adjust downward to a final probability of 30%.

# Checklist:

1. Paraphrase: Will the US formally accuse China of blockading at least one Taiwanese seaport without Taipei's consent before July 1, 2025?

2. Base rate: ~15% based on historical rarity of blockade accusations.

3. Consistency check: In 30 out of 100 similar situations, the US would formally accuse China of blockading a Taiwanese seaport within this timeframe.

4. Key evidence:
   - China explicitly simulated "sealing off" Taiwan's ports in October 2024
   - PLA activities around Taiwan showed escalating pattern through 2024
   - US-China diplomatic tensions over Taiwan continued through February 2025
   - Timeframe is relatively short (56 days)

5. Blind spot: China could conduct new operations that disrupt port access but are characterized by U.S. using different terminology.

6. Status quo: Increasing tensions and more aggressive Chinese military exercises, but no formal U.S. blockade accusations yet.

Probability: 30%
Predicted Probability: 30.0%

   - Facts vs. opinions: Properly attributes statements to officials and experts

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **China has conducted explicit blockade simulations**
   - Multiple reliable sources (CBC/AP and VOA) confirm exercises "simulating the 'sealing off' of Taiwan's ports" (Oct 2024)
   - PLA Eastern Theater Command described drills including "simulations of blockading key ports"
   - Demonstrates China has the operational concept and capabilities in place

2. **Increasing scale and frequency of Chinese military activities around Taiwan**
   - USNI News (Dec 2024): 53 aircraft and 19 ships detected in a two-day period
   - Historical comparisons show pattern of escalating activities
   - Multiple reliable sources tracking these movements
   - Shows growing Chinese willingness to use military pressure

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **US closely monitors and publicly characterizes Chinese military activities**
   - Multiple sources show US official statements on PLA exercises
   - State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller expressed "serious concern" about Chinese drills
   - Shows established pattern of US willingness to comment on Chinese actions

2. **Recent deterioration in US-China relations over Taiwan**
   - SCMP (Feb 2025): China accused US of "serious backsliding" on Taiwan policy
   - Ongoing diplomatic tension specifically focused on Taiwan status
   - Increases likelihood of strong US response to aggressive Chinese actions

3. **Expert assessment of blockade rehearsal intentions**
   - VOA (Oct 2024): Chieh Chung (Taiwan security expert) stated PLA is simulating "how to cut off Taiwan's air and sea traffic"
   - Lin Ying-yu (Tamkang University): China may be rehearsing area-denial operations
   - Suggests Taiwan security community views these as potential blockade preparations

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Chinese rhetorical positioning**
   - China consistently frames military activities as "warnings" against "Taiwan independence"
   - Standard position rather than indication of imminent action
   - Provides motivation but doesn't directly predict blockade implementation

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is **56 days** (May 6 to July 1, 2025), which is relatively short.

- This timeframe limits the opportunity for significant escalatory cycles to develop
- Reduces chance for new provocations that could trigger an actual blockade
- However, allows enough time for China to conduct another major exercise similar to previous "Joint Sword" operations

If the timeframe were halved (28 days), the probability would decrease further, as there would be less opportunity for provocative actions or for tensions to escalate to blockade levels.

If the timeframe were doubled (112 days), the probability would increase moderately, as it would include:
1. Time for additional PLA exercises around Taiwan
2. More opportunity for diplomatic incidents that could trigger Chinese escalation
3. Greater chance for miscalculation leading to crisis

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 7%:

**Factors increasing probability:**

1. **Recent blockade simulation precedent** (+4%): China has conducted explicit blockade simulations within the past year (Oct 2024), specifically targeting Taiwan's ports. These represent a significant escalation from previous PLA activities.

2. **Demonstrated encirclement capabilities** (+2%): China has shown the capability to surround Taiwan with substantial naval and air assets, as evidenced by the October 2024 exercise deploying 125 aircraft, the Liaoning carrier group, and establishing maritime zones encircling Taiwan.

3. **Recent bilateral tensions** (+2%): The February 2025 dispute over the US State Department website shows ongoing tensions specifically related to Taiwan policy, creating friction that could contribute to escalation.

**Factors decreasing probability:**

1. **High escalation risks for China** (-3%): A true blockade (rather than simulation) would risk triggering significant US and allied military responses and economic sanctions, creating a strong deterrent against implementation.

2. **US terminological restraint** (-2%): Despite previous blockade simulations, the US has characterized them as "provocative" rather than formal blockade accusations, suggesting a high threshold for such claims.

The adjustments result in a +3% net change from the outside view base rate.

## Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 7%, and carefully considering the evidence:

- The resolution criteria require three specific elements: (1) an actual blockade action (not just a simulation), (2) without Taiwanese consent, and (3) a formal US accusation.
- The historical pattern shows China conducting "simulations" rather than actual blockades.
- The US has shown restraint in its characterizations, despite provocative Chinese actions.
- The timeframe (56 days) is relatively short for a major escalation.

While tensions exist and recent military activities are concerning, the combination of all required elements occurring within the short timeframe remains unlikely. The evidence supports a modest increase from the base rate.

Final probability: 10%

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will US formally accuse China of blockading Taiwan's seaports without Taipei's consent before July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 7% from historical frequency of US blockade accusations
3. Consistency: In 10/100 identical scenarios, US would formally accuse China of blockading Taiwan
4. Key evidence: China's port blockade simulations (Oct 2024); escalating PLA deployments (Dec 2024); recent US-China tensions (Feb 2025); high strategic costs to China of actual blockade
5. Blind spot: Unforeseen military incident near Taiwan triggers partial port closure interpreted as blockade
6. Status quo: Current pattern is China conducting "simulations" without actual blockades; US expressing concern without formal accusations

Predicted Probability: 10.0%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
1.1 First Taiwan Strait Crisis (Wikipedia, 2024)  
  • Summary: Describes 1954–55 PRC shelling of ROC-held islands and US Seventh Fleet deployment.  
  • Quality/Date: Moderate reliability, dated but incomplete extraction; solid for historical precedent only.  
1.2 “A Chinese Economic Blockade of Taiwan Would Fail…” (War on the Rocks, Feb 2024)  
  • Summary: Dmitri Alperovitch argues a true PRC blockade is self-defeating (hurts China’s economy, risks war, prompts international backlash).  
  • Quality/Date: High; recent expert analysis with clear causal logic.  
1.3 CBC/AP “PLA simulates sealing off Taiwan’s ports” (Oct 2024)  
  • Summary: PLA held a one-day exercise simulating blockade of Taiwan’s ports; Taiwan commercial traffic unaffected.  
  • Quality/Date: High; reputable news agency, direct facts and quotes.  
1.4 USNI News “Chinese surge 53 military aircraft…” (Dec 2024)  
  • Summary: Large PLA air/naval incursions around Taiwan; Taiwan MND and MFA statements.  
  • Quality/Date: Moderate; specialized outlet, factual but focused on incursions, not blockade.  
1.5 SCMP “China accuses US of backsliding…” (Feb 2025)  
  • Summary: Beijing condemns US State Dept website update on Taiwan; warns against US “using Taiwan to contain China.”  
  • Quality/Date: High; credible regional outlet showing rising PRC rhetorical stakes.  
1.6 Perplexity “US accusation of ‘rehearsed blockade’” (Apr 2025)  
  • Summary: AI-compiled claim that in April 2025 the US accused China of rehearsing a blockade of Taiwan.  
  • Quality/Date: Medium; unverified AI summary but aligns with reported exercise patterns and rising US rhetoric.

2. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence:  
  • Historical base rate of zero actual PRC blockades in 75+ years (structural fact).  
  • Alperovitch’s analysis of strategic disincentives (direct causal mechanisms).  
Moderate evidence:  
  • PLA “blockade” exercises in Oct 2024 (current trend, repeated drills).  
  • US “rehearsed blockade” accusation in Apr 2025 (single source, plausible).  
  • SCMP account of Chinese diplomatic pushback (shows heightened tensions).  
Weak evidence:  
  • Recent PLA incursions (general pressure but not blockade).  
  • Short two-month window (volatile but limited).

3. Timeframe analysis  
  • Time until resolution: ~56 days (May 6–July 1 2025).  
  • If window halved (~28 days): less time for PRC to risk actual blockade → probability drops (e.g., from 12% to ~8%).  
  • If window doubled (~112 days to Nov 2025): more opportunity for crisis escalation → probability rises (e.g., to ~18%).

4. Justification  
  • Base rate near zero: PRC has never formally blockaded Taiwan.  
  • PLA drills simulate blockade but fall short of real maritime interdiction; US uses strong evidence before accusing blockade (Russia/Ukraine precedent).  
  • Strategic disincentives for PRC: self-harm to its own economy/semiconductors, risk of war with US/Japan, reputational costs.  
  • Rising US-China rhetoric: “rehearsed blockade” accusation suggests US is primed to use blockade language—but still a high bar for actual accusation.  
  • Short timeframe: PRC would likely reserve real blockade for an outright crisis, not conducted under status quo.  

Given a zero-historical base rate slightly offset by rising tensions and exercises, I make a modest upward adjustment from ~0% to 12%.

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question and resolution criteria  
   Will the U.S. publicly accuse China of “blockading” at least one of Taiwan’s seaports without Taipei’s consent by July 1, 2025? The clock runs for 56 days from today (May 6).

2. Source analysis  
   a. CBC/AP (Oct 14, 2024): PLA drills simulating “sealing off” Taiwan’s ports. High-quality AP reporting; facts on troop numbers and scope are reliable; Chinese statements convey intent to threaten “separatists.”  
   b. VOA (Oct 13, 2024): “Joint Sword-2024 B” exercises simulating blockade of key ports. Credible U.S. government quotes; expert commentary from Taiwan academics.  
   c. USNI News (Dec 10–11, 2024): Surge of 53 PLA aircraft and ship movements around Taiwan. Official Taiwanese MND data; PLA non-comment. Factual tracking details solid.  
   d. SCMP (Feb 17, 2025): China accuses U.S. of “backsliding” on one-China principle after a State Department website update. Authoritative quotes from MFA and State Dept.; shows PRC sensitivity to U.S. rhetoric but no blockade event.  
   e. Perplexity timeline (aggregate): Lists past U.S. blockade accusations (Russia 2022; Houthi attacks Mar 2025; China “rehearsal” blockade Apr 2025). Mixed reliability—Russia example is solid; the China “rehearsal” item needs corroboration.

3. Evidence analysis  
   Strong evidence (large shifts):  
   – Historical peacetime blockades are vanishingly rare outside declared wars, none by PRC against Taiwan (ref. class: actual blockades).  
   – Structural economic interdependence: Taiwan exports ~$100 billion/year in semiconductors; a real blockade would self-harm Beijing (demonstrable causal logic).  
   Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
   – Multiple recent PLA drills explicitly practicing port closures (CBC, VOA). Logical link to blockade capability but remain exercises, not operations.  
   – U.S. tendency to label “gray-zone” coercion harshly (State Dept. calls “harassment,” “provocative”), but has rarely used “blockade” absent actual port denial.  
   Weak evidence (small tweaks):  
   – PRC propaganda framing Taiwan as a “red line,” raising risk of miscalculation.  
   – Perplexity’s uncorroborated note of U.S. calling a “rehearsal blockade” in April 2025; may reflect internal U.S. messaging rather than public accusation.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – 56 days remain.  
   – If timeframe were halved (~28 days), probability would roughly halve: insufficient time for both China to enact and the U.S. to react with a public accusation.  
   – If doubled (~112 days), probability might roughly double but remain low (<10%) given structural constraints and lack of ongoing mobilization past drills.

5. Justification and adjustment from outside view (base 5%)  
   – Downward adjustments:  
     • No credible sign of port-sealing operations in motion; only simulations so far (strong evidence for inertia).  
     • PRC risk aversion to self-inflicted economic pain remains high (strong).  
     • U.S. reluctance to call routine drills a “blockade” absent port denial (moderate).  
   – Upward adjustments:  
     • Elevated Sino-U.S. tensions: recent website spat, increased congressional hawkishness (weak).  
     • Continued PLA gray-zone expansion could slip into an actual blockade by miscalculation (moderate).  
   Net shift: from 5% → ~4%.

6. Sub-factors for binary outcomes  
   No outcome factors:  
   – Only drills, not real closure; Beijing’s economic disincentives; lack of domestic PRC urgency; U.S. diplomats prefer calibrated language.  
   Yes outcome factors:  
   – A major Taiwanese event triggers an escalatory miscalculation; Xi orders short blockade to signal resolve; U.S. then publicly condemns it.

7. Expert/market expectations  
   – No active market on this specific event; expert commentary sees blockade as highly escalatory and unlikely short of war.

Probability calibration  
I believe a 4% chance the U.S. will publicly accuse China of an unauthorized blockade of Taiwan’s ports before July 1, 2025. This reflects the low base rate of peacetime blockades, offset only slightly by heightened gray-zone activity and Sino-U.S. friction.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: U.S. to accuse China of blockading Taiwan’s seaports without Taipei’s consent by July 1 2025 (56 days).  
2. Outside view base rate: ≈1–2 peacetime blockades per 80 years → ~1.5%/decade; scaled to 2 months ≈0.03%, rounded to 5% for elevated tensions.  
3. Consistency: In 4 out of 100 similar 56-day windows given current tensions, the U.S. would publicly accuse a real blockade.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a. No actual blockades to date (strong).  
   b. Multiple PLA blockade‐style drills (moderate).  
   c. U.S. hesitancy to use “blockade” term (moderate).  
   d. High economic self‐harm risk for China (strong).  
5. Blind spot: If Beijing suddenly decides on a surprise port‐sealing operation (e.g., around a PLA exercise), the U.S. could leap to condemnation—raising probability.  
6. Status quo outcome: Continuation of gray‐zone drills without port closure → U.S. issues statements on “harassment,” not full blockade.

Probability: 4%
Predicted Probability: 4.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Comparative Connections (Sep-2022, Sutter & Huang).  Peer-reviewed Asia‐watch journal.  Mostly factual chronicle of Chinese regional diplomacy/military moves; opinions limited to author synthesis.  Good historical context; dated.  
2. South China Morning Post (17 Feb 2025).  Mainstream Hong-Kong-based newspaper quoting PRC MFA.  High factual reliability for official Chinese statements; piece is recent.  
3. Atlantic Council/Rhodium report (Jun-2023).  Think-tank study with detailed methodology and many named officials.  Solid for structural/economic stakes; older but still relevant.  
4. USNI News (11 Dec 2024).  Specialist naval outlet citing Taiwan MND/Japan JSO numbers.  Factual, verifiable, recent.  
5. CBC/Assoc. Press (14 Oct 2024).  Global wire service; firsthand quotes from PLA/Taiwan/US officials on simulated blockade drill.  High factual quality; recent.  
6. VOA (13 Oct 2024).  US-funded broadcaster, factual reporting with multiple academic experts quoted.  Reliable; recent.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Across 2022-24 PLA has thrice executed large-scale “blockade style” drills; the U.S. government still avoided the legal term “blockade.”  (Multiple independent sources: CBC, VOA, USNI.) → lowers likelihood of future public use of the word absent qualitatively new PRC action.  
• A real blockade would risk >$2 trn annual economic shock (Atlantic Council/Rhodium).  Such structural costs make Beijing cautious, reducing chances within 56 days.  

Moderate evidence  
• PLA activity shows upward trend and occurs after political triggers (Lai inauguration, Nat. Day).  That cycle means a late-May or June 2025 exercise is plausible and could be a bit more coercive.  
• U.S. used the term “blockade” for Russia’s 2022 Black Sea actions, proving it will label a peer’s behavior that way if maritime trade is actually halted (Washington Post ref class).  
• PRC rhetoric remains uncompromising; no sign of de-escalation (SCMP Feb-2025).  

Weak evidence  
• Speculation that Xi might test the still-new U.S. administration in 2025.  
• Anecdotal chatter that Houthis/Red-Sea language may ‘normalize’ blockade accusations.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time left: 56 days (≈0.15 yr).  If the forecast window were halved (28 days) I would trim probability by ≈40 % (to ~1.8 %).  If doubled (112 days) I would raise probability by ≈60 % (to ~4.8 %), reflecting the compounding chance of a major PLA drill plus potential U.S. rhetorical shift.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Outside-view anchor: 1.5 % (see prompt).  
Shifters toward “Yes”  
+ Ongoing escalation trend; another major exercise by end-June has ~25 % chance (moderate evidence) → ×1.25.  
+ Precedent of U.S. calling Russia’s actions a blockade once shipping was truly impeded (moderate) → ×1.2.  

Shifters toward “No”  
– U.S. restraint: three prior PLA “seal-off” drills drew no blockade language (strong) → ×0.5.  
– Enormous economic/strategic cost makes an actual sustained interdiction—and thus a U.S. blockade charge—less than the probability of just another drill (strong) → ×0.7.  
– Only 56 days left; probability scales roughly linearly with time (strong) → implicitly captured in the base rate but merits no upward tweak.  

Combined multiplier ≈1.25 × 1.2 × 0.5 × 0.7 ≈ 0.525.  
Adjusted probability ≈1.5 % × 0.525 ≈ 0.8 %.  I round to 1 % to acknowledge tail uncertainties and keep an easy-to-communicate figure.

Probability calibration
Final inside-view probability that the United States will publicly accuse the PRC of blockading a Taiwanese port before 1 July 2025: 1 %.

Checklist:
1. Question restated: By 1 Jul 2025 will the U.S. government publicly accuse China of blockading any Taiwanese seaport?  
2. Base rate: 1.5 % (generic U.S. ‘blockade’ accusations).  
3. Consistency line: “I expect about 1 out of 100 comparable situations to meet the resolution.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) Three prior PLA blockade-style drills, no U.S. ‘blockade’ label. (ii) Rising Chinese military pressure trend. (iii) U.S. used term vs. Russia 2022 when shipping truly halted. (iv) Only 56 days remain.  
5. Blind-spot: PRC unexpectedly announces “inspection zone” diverting merchant traffic; U.S. instantly labels it blockade—probability would need to rise to ~15 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: Situation has cycled through provocations without tipping; default is continued restraint.

Probability: 1%

   - Summary: Coverage of "Joint Sword-2024 B" PLA exercises around Taiwan.
   - Quality: Generally reliable for factual reporting; ~7 months old.
   - Facts vs. Opinions: Mix of factual reporting and attributed expert analysis from named academics.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**

- **PLA Explicitly Simulated Port Blockades (Oct. 2024)**: Multiple sources confirm China conducted exercises specifically "simulating the sealing off of Taiwan's ports" with 125 aircraft (record high) and naval forces encircling Taiwan in six maritime zones. This language directly parallels "blockade" terminology.

- **Expert Assessment of Blockade Rehearsal**: Chieh Chung (Association of Strategic Foresight, Taiwan) stated the PLA was "simulating how to cut off Taiwan's air and sea traffic" and "impose a total blockade by staging drills corresponding to all of Taiwan's key ports" (VOA article).

**Moderate Evidence:**

- **Escalating Pattern of PLA Activities**: Multiple sources document increasingly aggressive Chinese military activities throughout 2024, with record numbers of aircraft incursions and increasingly comprehensive naval deployments around Taiwan.

- **U.S. Official Condemnation**: State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller called the October 2024 exercises "unwarranted" and warned they "risk escalation" - demonstrating U.S. willingness to publicly condemn Chinese military activities.

- **Recent Diplomatic Tensions**: February 2025 dispute over U.S. State Department website shows continuing high-level friction specifically regarding Taiwan policy.

**Weak Evidence:**

- **Absence of "Blockade" Term in U.S. Statements**: While the U.S. has condemned Chinese exercises, none of the sources indicate the U.S. has yet used the specific term "blockade" to characterize China's actions around Taiwan.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window spans 56 days (May 6 - July 1, 2025).

Key timeframe considerations:
- Most recent information is from February 2025, leaving a 3-month information gap.
- The October 2024 port-sealing simulations occurred ~7 months before the prediction window begins.

If the timeframe were halved (28 days): The probability would decrease by ~5-7% as there would be less time for escalation to reach the "blockade accusation" threshold.

If the timeframe were doubled (112 days): The probability would increase by ~8-10% due to more opportunities for provocative Chinese actions and U.S. diplomatic responses.

## (d) Justification:

Combining the evidence, several factors influence my prediction:

1. China has already explicitly simulated port blockades in large-scale military exercises, creating a precedent and demonstrating capability.

2. There's a documented pattern of escalating PLA activities around Taiwan throughout 2024, with each exercise becoming more comprehensive.

3. Diplomatic tensions specifically regarding Taiwan policy continued at least through February 2025.

4. For resolution, we need both: (a) China to implement actual port-blocking operations beyond simulations, and (b) U.S. officials to specifically characterize this as a "blockade" - a specific diplomatic threshold.

5. The 56-day window is relatively short, somewhat limiting the probability of such a sequence occurring.

The base rate for formal U.S. blockade accusations appears low historically. The sources don't indicate any previous U.S. accusations of China blockading Taiwan, suggesting this would be a significant escalation in diplomatic terminology.

# Probability Calibration

Starting with a base rate of approximately 15% (given the historical rarity of formal blockade accusations in U.S.-China relations regarding Taiwan), I adjust based on the evidence:

- China's explicit simulation of port-sealing (+12%): This significantly increases probability as it demonstrates capability and intent.
- Pattern of escalating PLA activities (+7%): Suggests continued escalation is plausible.
- Continued diplomatic tensions through February 2025 (+3%): Indicates persistent political tensions.
- The relatively short 56-day window (-5%): Limits time for new escalations to develop.

This brings my estimated probability to 32%.

However, I need to consider that the resolution requires a specific diplomatic characterization ("blockade"), not just military action. The U.S. might be cautious about using such terminology given its international legal implications. Additionally, the timeframe begins over 6 months after the most recent documented port-sealing simulations, allowing time for tensions to potentially subside.

These considerations lead me to slightly adjust downward to a final probability of 30%.

# Checklist:

1. Paraphrase: Will the US formally accuse China of blockading at least one Taiwanese seaport without Taipei's consent before July 1, 2025?

2. Base rate: ~15% based on historical rarity of blockade accusations.

3. Consistency check: In 30 out of 100 similar situations, the US would formally accuse China of blockading a Taiwanese seaport within this timeframe.

4. Key evidence:
   - China explicitly simulated "sealing off" Taiwan's ports in October 2024
   - PLA activities around Taiwan showed escalating pattern through 2024
   - US-China diplomatic tensions over Taiwan continued through February 2025
   - Timeframe is relatively short (56 days)

5. Blind spot: China could conduct new operations that disrupt port access but are characterized by U.S. using different terminology.

6. Status quo: Increasing tensions and more aggressive Chinese military exercises, but no formal U.S. blockade accusations yet.

Probability: 30%
Predicted Probability: 30.0%

   - Quality: Detailed with expert analysis and official statements
   - Age: ~7 months old - provides context on "Joint Sword-2024 B" exercises
   - Facts vs. opinions: Properly attributes statements to officials and experts

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **China has conducted explicit blockade simulations**
   - Multiple reliable sources (CBC/AP and VOA) confirm exercises "simulating the 'sealing off' of Taiwan's ports" (Oct 2024)
   - PLA Eastern Theater Command described drills including "simulations of blockading key ports"
   - Demonstrates China has the operational concept and capabilities in place

2. **Increasing scale and frequency of Chinese military activities around Taiwan**
   - USNI News (Dec 2024): 53 aircraft and 19 ships detected in a two-day period
   - Historical comparisons show pattern of escalating activities
   - Multiple reliable sources tracking these movements
   - Shows growing Chinese willingness to use military pressure

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **US closely monitors and publicly characterizes Chinese military activities**
   - Multiple sources show US official statements on PLA exercises
   - State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller expressed "serious concern" about Chinese drills
   - Shows established pattern of US willingness to comment on Chinese actions

2. **Recent deterioration in US-China relations over Taiwan**
   - SCMP (Feb 2025): China accused US of "serious backsliding" on Taiwan policy
   - Ongoing diplomatic tension specifically focused on Taiwan status
   - Increases likelihood of strong US response to aggressive Chinese actions

3. **Expert assessment of blockade rehearsal intentions**
   - VOA (Oct 2024): Chieh Chung (Taiwan security expert) stated PLA is simulating "how to cut off Taiwan's air and sea traffic"
   - Lin Ying-yu (Tamkang University): China may be rehearsing area-denial operations
   - Suggests Taiwan security community views these as potential blockade preparations

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Chinese rhetorical positioning**
   - China consistently frames military activities as "warnings" against "Taiwan independence"
   - Standard position rather than indication of imminent action
   - Provides motivation but doesn't directly predict blockade implementation

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is **56 days** (May 6 to July 1, 2025), which is relatively short.

- This timeframe limits the opportunity for significant escalatory cycles to develop
- Reduces chance for new provocations that could trigger an actual blockade
- However, allows enough time for China to conduct another major exercise similar to previous "Joint Sword" operations

If the timeframe were halved (28 days), the probability would decrease further, as there would be less opportunity for provocative actions or for tensions to escalate to blockade levels.

If the timeframe were doubled (112 days), the probability would increase moderately, as it would include:
1. Time for additional PLA exercises around Taiwan
2. More opportunity for diplomatic incidents that could trigger Chinese escalation
3. Greater chance for miscalculation leading to crisis

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 7%:

**Factors increasing probability:**

1. **Recent blockade simulation precedent** (+4%): China has conducted explicit blockade simulations within the past year (Oct 2024), specifically targeting Taiwan's ports. These represent a significant escalation from previous PLA activities.

2. **Demonstrated encirclement capabilities** (+2%): China has shown the capability to surround Taiwan with substantial naval and air assets, as evidenced by the October 2024 exercise deploying 125 aircraft, the Liaoning carrier group, and establishing maritime zones encircling Taiwan.

3. **Recent bilateral tensions** (+2%): The February 2025 dispute over the US State Department website shows ongoing tensions specifically related to Taiwan policy, creating friction that could contribute to escalation.

**Factors decreasing probability:**

1. **High escalation risks for China** (-3%): A true blockade (rather than simulation) would risk triggering significant US and allied military responses and economic sanctions, creating a strong deterrent against implementation.

2. **US terminological restraint** (-2%): Despite previous blockade simulations, the US has characterized them as "provocative" rather than formal blockade accusations, suggesting a high threshold for such claims.

The adjustments result in a +3% net change from the outside view base rate.

## Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 7%, and carefully considering the evidence:

- The resolution criteria require three specific elements: (1) an actual blockade action (not just a simulation), (2) without Taiwanese consent, and (3) a formal US accusation.
- The historical pattern shows China conducting "simulations" rather than actual blockades.
- The US has shown restraint in its characterizations, despite provocative Chinese actions.
- The timeframe (56 days) is relatively short for a major escalation.

While tensions exist and recent military activities are concerning, the combination of all required elements occurring within the short timeframe remains unlikely. The evidence supports a modest increase from the base rate.

Final probability: 10%

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will US formally accuse China of blockading Taiwan's seaports without Taipei's consent before July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 7% from historical frequency of US blockade accusations
3. Consistency: In 10/100 identical scenarios, US would formally accuse China of blockading Taiwan
4. Key evidence: China's port blockade simulations (Oct 2024); escalating PLA deployments (Dec 2024); recent US-China tensions (Feb 2025); high strategic costs to China of actual blockade
5. Blind spot: Unforeseen military incident near Taiwan triggers partial port closure interpreted as blockade
6. Status quo: Current pattern is China conducting "simulations" without actual blockades; US expressing concern without formal accusations

Probability: 10%
Predicted Probability: 10.0%

1.1 First Taiwan Strait Crisis (Wikipedia, 2024)  
  • Summary: Describes 1954–55 PRC shelling of ROC-held islands and US Seventh Fleet deployment.  
  • Quality/Date: Moderate reliability, dated but incomplete extraction; solid for historical precedent only.  
1.2 “A Chinese Economic Blockade of Taiwan Would Fail…” (War on the Rocks, Feb 2024)  
  • Summary: Dmitri Alperovitch argues a true PRC blockade is self-defeating (hurts China’s economy, risks war, prompts international backlash).

1.5 SCMP “China accuses US of backsliding…” (Feb 2025)  
  • Summary: Beijing condemns US State Dept website update on Taiwan; warns against US “using Taiwan to contain China.”  
  • Quality/Date: High; credible regional outlet showing rising PRC rhetorical stakes.  
1.6 Perplexity “US accusation of ‘rehearsed blockade’” (Apr 2025)  
  • Summary: AI-compiled claim that in April 2025 the US accused China of rehearsing a blockade of Taiwan.  
  • Quality/Date: Medium; unverified AI summary but aligns with reported exercise patterns and rising US rhetoric.

2. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence:  
  • Historical base rate of zero actual PRC blockades in 75+ years (structural fact).  
  • Alperovitch’s analysis of strategic disincentives (direct causal mechanisms).  
Moderate evidence:  
  • PLA “blockade” exercises in Oct 2024 (current trend, repeated drills).  
  • US “rehearsed blockade” accusation in Apr 2025 (single source, plausible).  
  • SCMP account of Chinese diplomatic pushback (shows heightened tensions).  
Weak evidence:  
  • Recent PLA incursions (general pressure but not blockade).  
  • Short two-month window (volatile but limited).

3. Timeframe analysis  
  • Time until resolution: ~56 days (May 6–July 1 2025).  
  • If window halved (~28 days): less time for PRC to risk actual blockade → probability drops (e.g., from 12% to ~8%).  
  • If window doubled (~112 days to Nov 2025): more opportunity for crisis escalation → probability rises (e.g., to ~18%).

4. Justification  
  • Base rate near zero: PRC has never formally blockaded Taiwan.  
  • PLA drills simulate blockade but fall short of real maritime interdiction; US uses strong evidence before accusing blockade (Russia/Ukraine precedent).  
  • Strategic disincentives for PRC: self-harm to its own economy/semiconductors, risk of war with US/Japan, reputational costs.  
  • Rising US-China rhetoric: “rehearsed blockade” accusation suggests US is primed to use blockade language—but still a high bar for actual accusation.  
  • Short timeframe: PRC would likely reserve real blockade for an outright crisis, not conducted under status quo.  

Given a zero-historical base rate slightly offset by rising tensions and exercises, I make a modest upward adjustment from ~0% to 12%.

Probability calibration  
Inside-view probability: 12%

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will the US publicly accuse PRC of blockading at least one Taiwan seaport without Taipei’s consent before July 1 2025?

3. Consistency: “12 out of 100 times, the US makes this blockade accusation by July 2025.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • Zero historical PRC blockades in 75+ years.  
   • Strong PRC disincentives (self-harm, war risk).  
   • PLA “blockade” drills but no real interdiction.  
   • US threshold from Russia/Ukraine precedent.  
   • Short 56-day window.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden Taiwan independence declaration triggers swift PRC blockade and US accusation.  
6. Status quo: No crisis → no blockade → US makes no accusation.

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question and resolution criteria  
   Will the U.S. publicly accuse China of “blockading” at least one of Taiwan’s seaports without Taipei’s consent by July 1, 2025? The clock runs for 56 days from today (May 6).

2. Source analysis  
   a. CBC/AP (Oct 14, 2024): PLA drills simulating “sealing off” Taiwan’s ports. High-quality AP reporting; facts on troop numbers and scope are reliable; Chinese statements convey intent to threaten “separatists.”  
   b. VOA (Oct 13, 2024): “Joint Sword-2024 B” exercises simulating blockade of key ports. Credible U.S. government quotes; expert commentary from Taiwan academics.  
   c. USNI News (Dec 10–11, 2024): Surge of 53 PLA aircraft and ship movements around Taiwan. Official Taiwanese MND data; PLA non-comment. Factual tracking details solid.  
   d. SCMP (Feb 17, 2025): China accuses U.S. of “backsliding” on one-China principle after a State Department website update. Authoritative quotes from MFA and State Dept.; shows PRC sensitivity to U.S. rhetoric but no blockade event.  
   e. Perplexity timeline (aggregate): Lists past U.S. blockade accusations (Russia 2022; Houthi attacks Mar 2025; China “rehearsal” blockade Apr 2025). Mixed reliability—Russia example is solid; the China “rehearsal” item needs corroboration.

3. Evidence analysis  
   Strong evidence (large shifts):  
   – Historical peacetime blockades are vanishingly rare outside declared wars, none by PRC against Taiwan (ref. class: actual blockades).  
   – Structural economic interdependence: Taiwan exports ~$100 billion/year in semiconductors; a real blockade would self-harm Beijing (demonstrable causal logic).  
   Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
   – Multiple recent PLA drills explicitly practicing port closures (CBC, VOA). Logical link to blockade capability but remain exercises, not operations.  
   – U.S. tendency to label “gray-zone” coercion harshly (State Dept. calls “harassment,” “provocative”), but has rarely used “blockade” absent actual port denial.  
   Weak evidence (small tweaks):  
   – PRC propaganda framing Taiwan as a “red line,” raising risk of miscalculation.  
   – Perplexity’s uncorroborated note of U.S. calling a “rehearsal blockade” in April 2025; may reflect internal U.S. messaging rather than public accusation.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – 56 days remain.  
   – If timeframe were halved (~28 days), probability would roughly halve: insufficient time for both China to enact and the U.S. to react with a public accusation.  
   – If doubled (~112 days), probability might roughly double but remain low (<10%) given structural constraints and lack of ongoing mobilization past drills.

5. Justification and adjustment from outside view (base 5%)  
   – Downward adjustments:  
     • No credible sign of port-sealing operations in motion; only simulations so far (strong evidence for inertia).  
     • PRC risk aversion to self-inflicted economic pain remains high (strong).  
     • U.S. reluctance to call routine drills a “blockade” absent port denial (moderate).  
   – Upward adjustments:  
     • Elevated Sino-U.S. tensions: recent website spat, increased congressional hawkishness (weak).  
     • Continued PLA gray-zone expansion could slip into an actual blockade by miscalculation (moderate).  
   Net shift: from 5% → ~4%.

6. Sub-factors for binary outcomes  
   No outcome factors:  
   – Only drills, not real closure; Beijing’s economic disincentives; lack of domestic PRC urgency; U.S. diplomats prefer calibrated language.  
   Yes outcome factors:  
   – A major Taiwanese event triggers an escalatory miscalculation; Xi orders short blockade to signal resolve; U.S. then publicly condemns it.

7. Expert/market expectations  
   – No active market on this specific event; expert commentary sees blockade as highly escalatory and unlikely short of war.

Probability calibration  
I believe a 4% chance the U.S. will publicly accuse China of an unauthorized blockade of Taiwan’s ports before July 1, 2025. This reflects the low base rate of peacetime blockades, offset only slightly by heightened gray-zone activity and Sino-U.S. friction.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: U.S. to accuse China of blockading Taiwan’s seaports without Taipei’s consent by July 1 2025 (56 days).  
2. Outside view base rate: ≈1–2 peacetime blockades per 80 years → ~1.5%/decade; scaled to 2 months ≈0.03%, rounded to 5% for elevated tensions.  
3. Consistency: In 4 out of 100 similar 56-day windows given current tensions, the U.S. would publicly accuse a real blockade.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a. No actual blockades to date (strong).  
   b. Multiple PLA blockade‐style drills (moderate).  
   c. U.S. hesitancy to use “blockade” term (moderate).  
   d. High economic self‐harm risk for China (strong).  
5. Blind spot: If Beijing suddenly decides on a surprise port‐sealing operation (e.g., around a PLA exercise), the U.S. could leap to condemnation—raising probability.  
6. Status quo outcome: Continuation of gray‐zone drills without port closure → U.S. issues statements on “harassment,” not full blockade.

Probability: 4%
Predicted Probability: 4.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Comparative Connections (Sep-2022, Sutter & Huang).  Peer-reviewed Asia‐watch journal.  Mostly factual chronicle of Chinese regional diplomacy/military moves; opinions limited to author synthesis.  Good historical context; dated.  
2. South China Morning Post (17 Feb 2025).  Mainstream Hong-Kong-based newspaper quoting PRC MFA.  High factual reliability for official Chinese statements; piece is recent.  
3. Atlantic Council/Rhodium report (Jun-2023).  Think-tank study with detailed methodology and many named officials.  Solid for structural/economic stakes; older but still relevant.  
4. USNI News (11 Dec 2024).  Specialist naval outlet citing Taiwan MND/Japan JSO numbers.  Factual, verifiable, recent.  
5. CBC/Assoc. Press (14 Oct 2024).  Global wire service; firsthand quotes from PLA/Taiwan/US officials on simulated blockade drill.  High factual quality; recent.  
6. VOA (13 Oct 2024).  US-funded broadcaster, factual reporting with multiple academic experts quoted.  Reliable; recent.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Across 2022-24 PLA has thrice executed large-scale “blockade style” drills; the U.S. government still avoided the legal term “blockade.”  (Multiple independent sources: CBC, VOA, USNI.) → lowers likelihood of future public use of the word absent qualitatively new PRC action.  
• A real blockade would risk >$2 trn annual economic shock (Atlantic Council/Rhodium).  Such structural costs make Beijing cautious, reducing chances within 56 days.  

Moderate evidence  
• PLA activity shows upward trend and occurs after political triggers (Lai inauguration, Nat. Day).  That cycle means a late-May or June 2025 exercise is plausible and could be a bit more coercive.  
• U.S. used the term “blockade” for Russia’s 2022 Black Sea actions, proving it will label a peer’s behavior that way if maritime trade is actually halted (Washington Post ref class).  
• PRC rhetoric remains uncompromising; no sign of de-escalation (SCMP Feb-2025).  

Weak evidence  
• Speculation that Xi might test the still-new U.S. administration in 2025.  
• Anecdotal chatter that Houthis/Red-Sea language may ‘normalize’ blockade accusations.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time left: 56 days (≈0.15 yr).  If the forecast window were halved (28 days) I would trim probability by ≈40 % (to ~1.8 %).  If doubled (112 days) I would raise probability by ≈60 % (to ~4.8 %), reflecting the compounding chance of a major PLA drill plus potential U.S. rhetorical shift.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Outside-view anchor: 1.5 % (see prompt).  
Shifters toward “Yes”  
+ Ongoing escalation trend; another major exercise by end-June has ~25 % chance (moderate evidence) → ×1.25.  
+ Precedent of U.S. calling Russia’s actions a blockade once shipping was truly impeded (moderate) → ×1.2.  

Shifters toward “No”  
– U.S. restraint: three prior PLA “seal-off” drills drew no blockade language (strong) → ×0.5.  
– Enormous economic/strategic cost makes an actual sustained interdiction—and thus a U.S. blockade charge—less than the probability of just another drill (strong) → ×0.7.  
– Only 56 days left; probability scales roughly linearly with time (strong) → implicitly captured in the base rate but merits no upward tweak.  

Combined multiplier ≈1.25 × 1.2 × 0.5 × 0.7 ≈ 0.525.  
Adjusted probability ≈1.5 % × 0.525 ≈ 0.8 %.  I round to 1 % to acknowledge tail uncertainties and keep an easy-to-communicate figure.

Probability calibration
Final inside-view probability that the United States will publicly accuse the PRC of blockading a Taiwanese port before 1 July 2025: 1 %.

Checklist:
1. Question restated: By 1 Jul 2025 will the U.S. government publicly accuse China of blockading any Taiwanese seaport?  
2. Base rate: 1.5 % (generic U.S. ‘blockade’ accusations).  
3. Consistency line: “I expect about 1 out of 100 comparable situations to meet the resolution.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) Three prior PLA blockade-style drills, no U.S. ‘blockade’ label. (ii) Rising Chinese military pressure trend. (iii) U.S. used term vs. Russia 2022 when shipping truly halted. (iv) Only 56 days remain.  
5. Blind-spot: PRC unexpectedly announces “inspection zone” diverting merchant traffic; U.S. instantly labels it blockade—probability would need to rise to ~15 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: Situation has cycled through provocations without tipping; default is continued restraint.
