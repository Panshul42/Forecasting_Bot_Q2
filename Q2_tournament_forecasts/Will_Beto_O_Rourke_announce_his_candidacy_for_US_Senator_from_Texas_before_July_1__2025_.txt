Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether Beto O’Rourke will announce a 2026 Texas Senate run before July 1, 2025 is establishing an outside-view baseline for typical announcement timing—and then layering in O’Rourke-specific signals. Historically, Texas U.S. Senate candidates form exploratory committees and make formal announcements roughly 15–18 months before the general election (e.g., Beto launched in March 2017 for the 2018 cycle). With the 2026 primary likely in early 2026, that suggests a window from late 2024 through spring 2025. I need to confirm:
• When did O’Rourke and other major Texas Senate contenders announce exploratory committees and formal campaigns in past cycles?
• What current fundraising, staff hires, public statements or exploratory committee filings has O’Rourke made?
• How have media and polls treated his likelihood of entry recently?

Analysis:
We are assessing the probability that Beto O’Rourke will formally announce a 2026 U.S. Senate campaign from Texas before the July 1, 2025 cutoff. Outview/Baseline: High‐profile candidates like O’Rourke often declare around 12–18 months before the election; this suggests a moderate to high baseline probability (perhaps 60–70%). Key inside‐view indicators include:
- Has O’Rourke filed any FEC paperwork for an exploratory or campaign committee?
- Recent public statements or interviews signaling intent or timeline.
- Formation of any “Draft Beto” PAC or grassroots draft efforts.
- Major Texas media coverage (e.g., Dallas Morning News, Austin American-Statesman) or national press picking up early hints.
- Fundraising activity that tracks toward a Senate bid.
- Social media or campaign website readiness.
We need the latest news on each of these fronts to adjust our forecast.

• A former El Paso City Council member and three-term U.S. Representative, O’Rourke launched his Senate bid in March, pledging to refuse PAC contributions and focus fundraising solely within Texas.

Here are the key takeaways from the El Paso Times roundup of major moments in Beto O’Rourke’s 2018 U.S. Senate race against Ted Cruz:

Facts & Statistics  
• O’Rourke had represented El Paso in Congress since 2012.  
• He lost to Cruz by just under 3 points in November 2018—the closest a Democrat has come to winning a Texas Senate seat since 1988.  
• Speculation about a Senate bid began in November 2016, when O’Rourke told the Texas Tribune he was weighing runs against Cruz in 2018 or Cornyn in 2020.  
• In March 2017, O’Rourke officially announced he’d challenge Cruz.  
• 2018 primary turnout: 1.5 million Republicans vs. 1 million Democrats.  
• Cruz won his GOP primary with 85% of the vote; O’Rourke won his Democratic primary with 61%.  
• In the Democratic primary, O’Rourke failed to secure a majority in more than half of Texas’s 32 border counties.  
• O’Rourke pledged to visit all 254 Texas counties; he completed the tour in June 2018, livestreaming much of it on Facebook (including a 24-hour continuous stream).  

Notable Campaign Episodes  
• “Bipartisan road trip”: In early 2017, O’Rourke and GOP Rep. Will Hurd drove from Texas to Washington, D.C., during a storm—live on Facebook—which earned them a Prize for Civility in Public Life from Allegheny College.  
• “Take a knee” moment: At a Houston town hall, O’Rourke defended NFL players’ right to kneel during the anthem. Politico reported the questioner had been planted by Cruz’s campaign. Cruz countered with an ad featuring Vietnam veteran double-amputee Tim Lee.  
• Celebrity endorsements & media: After the kneeling clip went viral, O’Rourke appeared on Ellen DeGeneres and Stephen Colbert’s shows—points Cruz used to paint him as out-of-touch.  
• “Triple Meat Whataburger liberal”: A Cruz spokeswoman mocked O’Rourke’s campaign logo as too similar to Whataburger packaging; O’Rourke’s team leaned into it by ordering the same burger in South Texas.  
• Debates: After protracted negotiations, Cruz and O’Rourke agreed to three debates. In Dallas, Cruz labeled O’Rourke a “radical,” while O’Rourke argued Cruz had underperformed as senator. When asked what they admired about one another, O’Rourke praised Cruz as a working father.  

Expert Analysis (named in article)  
• Texas political experts said O’Rourke faced an uphill battle and needed to run statewide ads to boost his name recognition—something he largely resisted early on.

5. Methodology notes  
• FEC databases feed OpenSecrets’ summary numbers shortly after month-end; detailed records follow after the 20th.  
• Donor occupation/employer disclosures (required for contributions over $200) are coded to industries; clusters of gifts from an organization (e.g. corporate PACs, employees) show up among top contributors.  
• In cases where family members share income sources, OpenSecrets attributes all related contributions to the primary income-earner’s employer.  
• Ideological contributions may be coded by policy interest rather than employer when relevant.

All data reflect the 2017–2018 election cycle; figures may not sum perfectly due to differing data‐processing timelines and summary vs. itemized reporting.

Here are the key points from Julián Aguilar’s December 14, 2018 Texas Tribune article:

Facts & Context  
• In November 2018, Rep. Beto O’Rourke narrowly lost his bid to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz.  
• Fellow Texas Democrat Julián Castro has formed an exploratory committee for a possible 2020 presidential run and will decide by January 12, 2019.  

O’Rourke on Castro’s presidential prospects (named, reliable source)  
• Calls Castro’s likely candidacy “positive for the United States” and praises his ideas and record as HUD secretary and San Antonio mayor.  
• Says Castro’s decision does not dictate O’Rourke’s own political plans.  

O’Rourke on his own future plans (named, reliable source)  
• Hasn’t ruled anything out, including a potential 2020 Senate challenge to Republican John Cornyn.  
• Admits he’s “no closer to deciding” now—five weeks after the election—than he was immediately afterward.  
• Plans to spend his remaining weeks in Congress focusing on representing El Paso, finishing out his term, and deciding what’s best for his family and country thereafter.  

Recent & upcoming activities  
• Held his 104th (and final) town hall in El Paso on Dec. 14.  
• Visited a migrant shelter in Ciudad Juárez to meet with asylum-seekers.  
• Scheduled to rally outside the Tornillo youth detention center and return to Washington to oppose funding for President Trump’s border wall, risking a government shutdown.

<Summary source="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2018/12/12/315162/julian-castro-moves-toward-2020-white-house-run/">
• On Dec. 12, 2018, the AP reports that former San Antonio mayor and ex-HUD secretary Julian Castro (44) has formed a presidential exploratory committee for a possible 2020 run.  
• Castro tells the AP he will announce his final decision on Jan. 12, 2019.  
• An exploratory committee “legally allows potential candidates to begin raising money,” but also gives Castro an early fundraising and organizational edge.  
• Castro says, “I know where I’m leaning, for sure,” and notes that early polling favorites often falter: “The most dangerous place to be right now is actually in the pole position.”  
• He frames any decision to run as based on having “a compelling message” and a willingness “to work hard and get to the voters.”  
• The Democratic field is “shaping up as crowded,” with no clear front-runner against President Trump.  
• Outgoing Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who narrowly lost to Ted Cruz in Texas, is viewed as particularly ascendant and is “exciting donors and activists.”  
• Other potential contenders mentioned include Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, and former Vice President Joe Biden.  
• Castro downplays the impact of others: of O’Rourke he says, “He’s talented. He ran a good race against Ted Cruz. I’ll let him talk about his future.”  
• Castro has not yet spoken to former President Obama about his plans but intends to consult Democratic leaders; Obama spoke with O’Rourke about 2020.  
• Background: Castro was Obama’s HUD secretary (2014–17), was 2012 DNC keynote speaker, and would be among the youngest and most prominent Latino candidates. His twin brother Joaquin Castro is a U.S. congressman from Texas.  
• Castro emphasizes the importance of Latino representation on the 2020 Democratic debate stage, saying the community has been treated “like a pinata” under Trump and “deserves a candidate.”  
• Despite his national profile, in Texas he has been eclipsed by O’Rourke’s near-victory in the Senate race, setting up the unusual possibility of two Texans running for president.

<Summary source="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/31/politics/elizabeth-warren-exploratory-committee-2020">
Here’s a summary of the CNN article “Elizabeth Warren launches exploratory committee ahead of likely 2020 presidential run” (Dec. 31, 2018):

Facts & Figures  
• On Dec. 31, 2018, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) announced via video and email that she has formed an exploratory committee for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.  
• This move comes roughly 13 months before the Iowa caucuses, making her the first Democrat with a national profile to take formal campaign steps so early.  
• Warren enters the cycle with $12.5 million left over from her 2018 Senate campaign (per FEC records), which she can transfer to her presidential effort.  
• She has already received small-dollar donations from all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico.  

Key Themes & Messaging  
• Warren’s four-and-a-half-minute video emphasizes:  
  – Economic equality and reining in big corporations (“Corruption is poisoning our democracy”)  
  – Government accountability (criticizing insurance companies, banks, oil companies)  
  – Racial inequality (“families of color face a path that is steeper and rockier…”)  
• She frames her pitch around her own “hardscrabble childhood” in Oklahoma and rising through public education, law school, and the Senate.  

Named–Source Opinions & Reactions  
• In the video, Warren: “I don’t think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires… Democrats are the party of the people.”  
• President Donald Trump (interview on Fox News): mocked Warren’s ancestry test, called her “Pocahontas,” and quipped he’d need to ask her psychiatrist whether she thinks she can beat him.  
• Rufus Gifford, Obama’s 2012 campaign finance director (via tweet): “Elizabeth Warren must think she can put up huge $$ numbers on her January report—scaring others out of the race.”  

Less-Reliable or Anonymous Opinions  
• A “fundraiser” (unnamed Democrat) speculated Warren’s New Year’s Eve launch was a gamble to generate a big day-one haul and deter rivals.  
• A source close to Warren suggested the timing was driven less by media impact and more by the need to “build an apparatus” (hire staff, set up infrastructure).  

Campaign Build-Out  
• Since her November 2018 re-election, Warren has been making calls to grassroots leaders in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.  
• Staff are scouting campaign office space in the Boston area; Dan Geldon (longtime aide and former chief of staff) is expected to play a senior role.  

Context  
• Her announcement coincided with a partial federal government shutdown over Trump’s border-wall funding demand—a backdrop that Warren could leverage to highlight her anti-corruption, pro-middle-class message.  
• The 2020 Democratic field is anticipated to be crowded, with roughly two dozen potential candidates already testing the waters, including Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Beto O’Rourke.

Here’s a concise summary of the New York Times article “Beto O’Rourke Enters the 2020 Presidential Campaign” by Matt Flegenheimer and Jonathan Martin (published March 14, 2019).  

• Identity and background  
  – Robert “Beto” O’Rourke, 46, former three-term U.S. Representative from El Paso, Texas; punk-rock enthusiast known for an “oversharing” social-media style.  
  – First elected to Congress in 2012; in 2018 nearly unseated Senator Ted Cruz, losing by roughly 200,000 votes after visiting all 254 Texas counties and raising record small-donor funds.  

• Announcement and campaign style  
  – Formally declared his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on March 14, 2019, in Burlington, Iowa, releasing a video just before launching a three-day grassroots tour of eastern Iowa.  
  – Emphasizes retail politicking—unpublicized local stops, impromptu Q&As, heavy use of live-streaming on social media.  

• Policy themes  
  – National unity and generational change; likely priorities include universal health care, stricter gun laws, immigration reform (“We don’t need another wall”).  
  – Contrasts himself with “big-ticket” progressives by pitching a broad message rather than a single signature proposal.  

• Perceived strengths and weaknesses  
  – Strengths: energetic town-hall style, appeal to younger voters, substantial small-donor network; charismatic, media-savvy presence.  
  – Weaknesses: few legislative achievements, no major policy anchor, potential questions about a white male nominee after 2018’s diversity-driven midterm gains; narrowly lost his last race.  

• Early reactions  
  – Fellow Democrats (Julian Castro, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris) swiftly acknowledged or counter-messaged; former Vice President Joe Biden expected to join soon.  
  – President Trump mocked O’Rourke’s animated speaking style in a subsequent Oval Office appearance.  

Overall, O’Rourke’s entry shakes up an increasingly crowded field—positioning a “relentless campaigner” whose success will hinge on translating retail energy into broad policy credibility.

  – In a post-event interview with WFAA, he said he’s focused on “bringing people together at town hall meetings,” registering voters and leading his volunteer group, Powered by People, and that “we’ll see what the future holds, but I’m going to do whatever is the greatest good for the greatest number in this state.”

Here is a summary of the PBS News article “Beto O’Rourke says nothing in his past will hinder 2020 run” (March 18, 2019):

• Context  
  – Location: Madison, Wisconsin, March 17 event in a coffee shop.  
  – About 400 people attended (half inside, half listening from the door).  
  – Wisconsin narrowly went for Trump in 2016 (by fewer than 23,000 votes). O’Rourke said the state is “fundamental” to any Democratic presidential prospect.

• O’Rourke’s key statements and facts  
  1. Nothing undisclosed in his past could hurt a 2020 campaign.  
     – He’s previously admitted a 1998 DUI arrest; says he’s revealed all else.  
  2. He has never taken LSD—answered after a fan asked him to sign a skateboard.  
  3. Language pledge: again vowed to stop using profanity (“keep it clean”), after breaking a similar promise in his 2018 Senate run.  
  4. Campaigning strategy:  
     – Promised to return often to Wisconsin (Milwaukee hosts the 2020 Democratic convention).  
     – Would prefer a woman as running mate but called it “presumptuous” to lock in that decision now.  
  5. Personal touches: wore a St. Patrick’s Day green-cabbage necklace; joked about Irish heritage.

• Other Democratic candidates’ highlights (all reported by PBS News)  
  – Elizabeth Warren (Tennessee stop): proposed “ultra-millionaires” tax on households worth $50 million+; estimates $2.75 trillion revenue over ten years; continues grassroots, no–corporate–donations approach.  
  – Kirsten Gillibrand: officially launched her 2020 campaign via video; first speech scheduled outside Trump International Hotel in New York.  
  – Amy Klobuchar (Iowa): moved by a tearful Vietnam veteran telling her about his son’s death; underscored importance of mental-health centers.  
  – Pete Buttigieg: announced he’d surpassed the DNC’s 65,000–donor threshold (now at 76,000) to qualify for summer debates; sees signs pointing toward an official candidacy.

<Summary source="https://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/bud-kennedy/article305148546.html">
Here are the key points from Naomi Skinner’s April 28, 2025 Fort Worth Star-Telegram opinion piece:

Facts & figures  
• Beto O’Rourke lost the 2018 Texas U.S. Senate race to Ted Cruz by 3 points and the 2022 gubernatorial race to Greg Abbott by 11 points.  
• He raised nearly $180 million across those two campaigns.  
• Observers expect the 2026 Democratic Senate nominee in Texas may need to raise up to $100 million, in what could be a $200 million-plus contest.  

Direct statements by O’Rourke (reliable source: his own public remarks)  
• At an April 26 town hall in Denton for his voter-mobilization group (Powered by People), he said: “If… this is what the people of Texas want… then yes, I will,” when asked if he’d run for Senate in 2026.  
• To WFAA, he added: “I’m going to do whatever is most helpful for the people of Texas… whatever is the greatest good for the greatest number in this state.”  
• He told The News that if Ken Paxton wins the March 2026 Republican primary over John Cornyn, it would be a “gift” to Democrats.  

Context & background  
• This is one of the first times O’Rourke has directly entertained a 2026 Senate bid, though he’s long been discussed as a possibility.  
• Other Democrats mentioned as potential 2026 Senate candidates include former U.S. Rep. Colin Allred (lost to Cruz by 8 points in 2024), state Sens. Nathan Johnson and Roland Gutierrez.  
• O’Rourke continues holding town halls across North Texas (recent stops: Denton, Mansfield, Wichita Falls, Fort Bend County), sometimes alongside former Democratic VP nominee Tim Walz.  
• In his speeches he’s touched on American government principles, freedom, due process, and criticized President Trump’s deportation policies.

**Bolsonaro Announces 2026 Presidential Bid Despite Ineligibility**
Former President Jair Bolsonaro has declared his intention to run for President in 2026, despite being declared ineligible by the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE). In a video posted on his X account, Bolsonaro stated, 'We will both be candidates next year. Tarcísio for re-election and I for president. If I don't appear as a candidate, it's a denial of democracy. What crime did I commit? Meeting with ambassadors? Oh, have patience.' Bolsonaro also mentioned the case of Romania, where a right-wing candidate was removed from the election and the court confirmed their ineligibility. He claimed that the people do not accept what he calls 'Lawfare', or political interference in the destiny of a nation. Bolsonaro's declaration was made in March, but was reposted on his X account on May 21, 2025.

**Hontiveros 'open' to possibility of running in 2028 presidential race**
Senator Risa Hontiveros said she is open to the possibility of running for president in 2028, but her focus is currently on uniting the opposition and allies in the next nine months. 'I'm not saying no. I'm open to all possibilities,' she said. Hontiveros emphasized the importance of consolidation and unity among opposition senators, saying 'my priority right now is to unite, consolidate during the first nine months after election.' She also expressed concern over Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman's statement that President Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr. will sit in the budget process for the 2026 General Appropriations Act, saying 'the power of the purse is wielded by Congress and Congress alone, not the executive.' Hontiveros vowed to refile bills on SOGIESC, dissolution of marriage, and anti-teenage pregnancy in the 20th Congress if they fail to be approved before the end of the 19th Congress on June 13. She also plans to seek retaining the chairmanship of the Senate committee on women, children, family relations and gender equality in the next Congress.

**2027 election: After 2 governors, 3 PDP senators endorse Tinubu's 2nd term ambition**
Three Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senators from Osun state, Senator Kamarudeen Lere Oyewumi, Senator Olubiyi Fadeyi Ajagunla, and Senator Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi, have endorsed President Bola Tinubu's second term ambition in the 2027 presidential election. They cited Tinubu's transformative infrastructural projects and effective economic policies, which have led to a significant reduction in food prices and improvement in national security. According to the senators, their endorsement is a 'clear reflection of genuine confidence and satisfaction with President Tinubu's delivery of democratic dividends.' This is the latest endorsement of Tinubu's second term from opposition leaders, following Governor Umo Eno of Akwa Ibom State and Governor Charles Soludo of Anambra state, who have also announced their support for Tinubu's candidacy.

**The 'Iron Stache' Is Back: Wisconsin Ironworker Randy Bryce Announces 2026 House Run | Common Dreams**
Randy Bryce, a disabled veteran and former union ironworker, announced his candidacy for the 2026 U.S. House election in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District. Bryce, also known as the 'Iron Stache', aims to oust incumbent Rep. Bryan Steil, a Trump ally. Bryce's campaign focuses on protecting social services like Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security, and promoting union representation in Congress. He believes that Democrats lack a coherent vision for defeating Trumpism and the oligarchy, and that union people and working-class Americans need to be represented in Congress. Bryce said, 'With what Trump and Musk have been doing, it's more important than ever to get union people, working people, into Congress.' He also stated, 'This isn't about left versus right, it's about the billionaires versus the rest of us, and we've got the numbers!'

**Bolsonaro's Endorsement of Caporezzo Sparks Senate Dispute in Minas Gerais**
A video circulating on social media shows former President Jair Bolsonaro calling Deputy Cristiano Caporezzo a 'senator', during a meeting with supporters. The recording has gained strength among Bolsonaro supporters in Minas Gerais and has agitated the party's backstage in the state, which is living an internal dispute to define who will be the PL candidate for the Senate in 2026. 'A senator for the photo here! It's Senator Caporezzo!', says Bolsonaro while pointing to the Minas Gerais parliamentarian, as someone next to him says: 'I'll go with whoever you tell me to.' The video has been shared in WhatsApp groups linked to Bolsonaro's base in Minas. This declaration happens in the midst of an internal dispute in the PL to define who will be the party's name in the Senate race next year. Although two vacancies are in dispute for Minas Gerais in the 2026 elections, as allowed by electoral law, the PL, as O TEMPO has already anticipated, intends to launch only one candidate for the position. Currently, at least four names are competing for the party's preference: in addition to Caporezzo, also in the running are federal deputies Domingos Sávio and Eros Biondini and Belo Horizonte city councilor Vile Santos. Behind the scenes of the party, one faction defends Caporezzo's name, mainly due to his proximity to Bolsonaro and alignment with conservative agendas. Another current, however, sees Domingos Sávio as the favorite, especially due to his relationship with mayors, state affiliates and businessmen from Minas. Eros Biondini, on the other hand, has publicly declared that he intends to run for the Senate. According to allies, he is considering leaving the party if he is not chosen. Caporezzo, although officially a pre-candidate for federal deputy in 2026, also remains available to run for the Senate, as he stated in a recent interview to the program Café com Política, from O TEMPO's YouTube channel.

**Gouveia e Melo Announces Presidential Candidacy for 2026 Election**
Henrique Gouveia e Melo, a former Chief of the Navy, announced his candidacy for the 2026 presidential election on April 14. He will officially present his candidacy on May 29 in Lisbon. Gouveia e Melo stated that his decision was influenced by 'some internal instability' in the country, due to short-term governments and a lack of stable governance. He emphasized that 'this internal instability is visible to all Portuguese' and that the 'world has changed a lot' since 2023. Gouveia e Melo also mentioned the ongoing war in Ukraine, increased tensions in Europe, and the election of Donald Trump as US President, which have altered the international configuration. He believes that there is a new attempt to build a new world order that may be 'perilous' or 'affect us significantly'. Gouveia e Melo was born in Mozambique and has a 22-year career in the Navy, including three years as head of the Navy. He decided to retire from active duty after his term ended, citing that it would give him 'some freedom' in his 'civil rights'.

**Jared Golden announces intention to seek reelection**
Maine Representative Jared Golden has announced his intention to seek reelection, citing the need for Democrats to win back the House of Representatives. Golden, a centrist Democrat, has been considered a contender for statewide office and has the support of various union leaders and Democratic leadership. His campaign manager, Kathleen Burns, called him a 'proven winner' and the 'right choice' to beat Republican challenger Paul LePage. Golden's decision means that Democrats will now have to look elsewhere for a candidate to challenge Senator Susan Collins in 2026. The Cook Political Report rates Collins' race as 'Lean Republican' and the governor's race in 2026 as 'Likely Democrat'.

**Former state legislator López Franzen ends campaign for US Senate**
Former State Sen. Melisa López Franzen has ended her campaign for Minnesota's open U.S. Senate seat. López Franzen, who was among three DFL candidates vying for the seat, stated, 'This is not about stepping back — it’s about stepping with intention into the space where I can have the greatest impact.' She cited reflection and conversations with family, supporters, and community leaders as reasons for her decision. López Franzen had been overshadowed by Lt. Gov Peggy Flanagan and U.S. Rep. Angie Craig in endorsements and available money. Two Republican candidates, Royce White and Adam Schwarze, have announced their intention to run for the seat. López Franzen's decision leaves the field open for other candidates to pursue the seat, which will be vacated by Sen. Tina Smith after 2026.

Mena will be the first place candidate for San José on the PNG's ticket, led by Fernando Zamora, who is running for president. Mena stated that he is running due to the 'critical moment' the country is facing in the formation of the Congress. He emphasized the need for a serious and transparent Congress, rather than the 'circus of shame' that currently exists in the Asamblea Legislativa. Mena also downplayed the popularity of the government of Rodrigo Chaves and the current dynamics of the opposition, saying 'Let's be honest, Rodrigo Chaves won the election because the other candidate was José María Figueres. There is a great frustration with politics in the country and a lot of internal anger among Costa Ricans.' The PNG has already renewed 82 of its 84 national structures, and Mena stated that the party will meet the legal requirements for the upcoming presidential campaign this week.

**Democrat Julian Beaudion announces US Senate run against Republican Mike Rounds in 2026**
Democrat Julian Beaudion has announced his candidacy for the US Senate in 2026, running against Republican incumbent Mike Rounds. Beaudion, a Sioux Falls activist and business owner, cited Rounds' support for President Trump and Elon Musk's policies as a reason for his decision. 'This campaign isn’t about me—it’s about securing a future where South Dakota’s working families don’t get left behind,' Beaudion said. He plans to focus on enforcing checks and balances, rejecting the influence of big money and tech monopolies, and investing in workers and communities to prepare for the future of AI and automation.

**Beto Albuquerque to Run for Deputy in 2026**
Beto Albuquerque, a prominent figure in the PSB gaúcho, has announced his candidacy for deputy in 2026. In December, he was convinced by party leaders to run for another term as deputy. The decision to run for a seat in the Congress in Brasília or the Assembleia Legislativa will be made in March. However, the candidacy is considered certain by the party's high-ranking officials. In 2022, Beto was chosen by the party to run for governor, but he dropped out in August, citing difficulties in structuring a viable candidacy. He also announced that he was leaving public and political life, but remaining in the party. Vicente Bogo took over the candidacy and received only 17,222 votes (0.27%), finishing eighth in the first round. Beto's health issues, including a life-threatening cardiovascular surgery in July 2024, had kept him out of the party's recent activities. However, in December, he met with socialist leaders who convinced him to re-enter the election. Members from various parts of the state were involved in the mobilization to persuade Beto to run again, and he has agreed to do so. His last election was in 2018, when he ran for senator and was not elected. Four years earlier, he ran for vice-president on Marina Silva's ticket.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **El Paso Times (2017)**: High-quality local reporting documenting O'Rourke's official filing for the 2018 Senate race against Cruz. Contains verifiable facts about his campaign launch, signature gathering, and pledge to refuse PAC money. Factual rather than opinion-based.

2. **El Paso Times (2018)**: Detailed retrospective on O'Rourke's 2018 Senate campaign with factual information about his electoral performance (lost by <3 points), campaign timeline (announced March 2017), and strategy (visiting all 254 counties). Contains limited expert opinions about his campaign challenges but primarily factual.

3. **OpenSecrets (2019)**: Highly reliable campaign finance data from FEC filings showing O'Rourke's 2018 fundraising breakdown (54% large contributions, 46% small contributions, minimal PAC money). Pure factual financial reporting.

4. **Texas Tribune (Dec 2018)**: Credible reporting on O'Rourke's post-2018 election statements. Key facts include his acknowledgment that he hadn't ruled out challenging Cornyn in 2020 and was "no closer to deciding" his future plans. Separates O'Rourke's direct quotes from analysis.

5. **Houston Public Media (Dec 2018)**: Reliable reporting on Julian Castro's presidential exploratory committee formation, with contextual information about O'Rourke being viewed as "exciting donors and activists" after his Senate run. Generally factual with limited characterizations.

6. **CNN (Dec 2018)**: Factual reporting on Elizabeth Warren's exploratory committee announcement with contextual information about the anticipated 2020 Democratic field, including O'Rourke. Contains quoted opinions from named sources but maintains factual reporting.

7. **Perplexity Report**: Synthesized information about Texas Senate candidacy announcement timelines, showing patterns from multiple election cycles. Key factual information includes:
   - Ted Cruz (2012): Announced 18 months before primary
   - O'Rourke (2018): Announced March 2017, ~12 months before primary
   - Colin Allred (2024): Announced May 2023, 10 months before primary
   - John Cornyn/Ken Paxton (2026): Announced March/April 2025
   - Common pre-announcement signals: fundraising activity, staff hires, public statements, grassroots mobilization

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Three potential reference classes emerge:

1. **O'Rourke's own Senate candidacy history**: Limited to his 2018 run, announced ~12 months before the primary.

2. **Recent Texas Senate candidacy announcements (2012-2026)**: More robust data showing candidates typically announce 10-18 months before primaries.

3. **Democratic challengers in Texas Senate races**: Shows challengers like O'Rourke (2018) and Allred (2024) announced 10-12 months before primaries.

Reference class #2 is most suitable as it provides the strongest pattern across multiple elections while including O'Rourke's own history.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

Today is May 22, 2025, and the prediction deadline is July 1, 2025 – a window of 40 days.

- Texas primaries typically occur in March (for the 2026 election, likely March 2026)
- Working backward from March 2026:
  - 10 months prior = May 2025 (now)
  - 12 months prior = March 2025 (2 months ago)
  - 18 months prior = September 2024 (8 months ago)

We are currently at the end of the typical announcement window (10-18 months before primary). The Perplexity report indicates major candidates for the 2026 race have already announced (Cornyn in March 2025, Paxton in April 2025).

## (d) Justification:

Several factors influence the likelihood of O'Rourke announcing before July 1, 2025:

1. **Timing patterns**: The data shows Texas Senate candidates typically announce 10-18 months before primaries. We're currently at the end of this window for the 2026 election.

2. **Competitor announcements**: Major candidates for the 2026 race (Cornyn, Paxton) have already announced in March-April 2025, creating pressure for any serious challenger to enter soon.

3. **O'Rourke's prior pattern**: For his 2018 run, O'Rourke announced 12 months before the primary, suggesting he prefers to announce early to build grassroots momentum.

4. **Campaign preparation time**: O'Rourke's 2018 strategy required significant lead time for county tours, small-donor fundraising, and grassroots organizing.

5. **Absence of reported signals**: The sources don't indicate any recent pre-announcement signals from O'Rourke (staff hires, fundraising, public statements about the 2026 race).

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I need to consider:

1. We're at the end of the typical announcement window (10-18 months before March 2026)
2. Major candidates have already announced their 2026 campaigns
3. If O'Rourke intends to run, historical patterns suggest he would announce soon
4. The absence of reported pre-announcement signals reduces confidence
5. The short 40-day window limits uncertainty somewhat

This requires breaking down two probabilities:
- IF O'Rourke intends to run, what's the probability he announces in the next 40 days?
- What's the probability O'Rourke intends to run at all?

For the first question, given the typical announcement timing patterns and that major candidates have already announced, I estimate ~75-80% chance he would announce before July 1 IF he intends to run.

For the second question, without specific signals of his intentions, and considering his previous political ambitions but also his absence from the current conversation, I estimate ~35-40% chance he intends to run.

Combining these: 38% × 78% = 29.6%

## Outside View Prediction:
30%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **El Paso Times (Nov 2017)**: Factual reporting of O'Rourke's official filing for the 2018 Senate race against Cruz. Contains verified details about his campaign approach (refusing PAC money, focusing on Texas-only fundraising) and provides reliable timeline information about his candidacy launch.

2. **El Paso Times (Nov 2018)**: Comprehensive factual summary of O'Rourke's 2018 Senate campaign, including specific vote margins, primary statistics, and key campaign moments. Contains minimal opinion except for a brief mention of Texas political experts noting O'Rourke faced an "uphill battle."

3. **OpenSecrets (2019)**: High-quality factual data about O'Rourke's 2017-2018 campaign finances from the FEC. Contains no opinions, only verified fundraising statistics and contributor information. OpenSecrets is a respected non-partisan research organization.

4. **Texas Tribune (Dec 2018)**: Reliable reporting with direct quotes from O'Rourke about his post-Senate loss thinking, including that he was "no closer to deciding" his future plans five weeks after the election. Contains factual information about his activities and direct quotes rather than speculation.

5. **Houston Public Media (Dec 2018)**: Factual coverage of Julian Castro's exploratory committee formation with contextual mentions of O'Rourke as a potential 2020 contender. Includes direct quotes from Castro about the race, with minimal opinion content.

6. **CNN (Dec 2018)**: Primarily focused on Elizabeth Warren's exploratory committee announcement, with brief mentions of other potential 2020 candidates including O'Rourke. Contains both factual reporting and some unnamed source opinions about campaign strategy.

7. **Perplexity Report (2023)**: Provides structured information about Texas Senate candidate announcement timelines from 2012-2026. Contains specific dates and patterns but includes information about 2025-2026 that would be future projections from our current date. Should be treated with caution despite its comprehensive appearance.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several potential reference classes emerge:

1. **O'Rourke's previous Senate run timing**: O'Rourke announced his 2018 Senate candidacy in March 2017, approximately 12 months before the primary.

2. **Texas Democratic Senate challengers (2018-2024)**: Per the Perplexity report, O'Rourke announced 12 months before the 2018 primary, and Colin Allred announced 10 months before the 2024 primary.

3. **Texas Senate candidates broadly (2012-2024)**: Candidates typically announced 10-18 months before primaries (Cruz at 18 months, O'Rourke at 12 months, Allred at 10 months).

4. **O'Rourke's decision-making pattern after electoral defeat**: After his 2018 loss, O'Rourke explicitly stated he was "no closer to deciding" his plans five weeks after the election.

The most suitable reference class combines #1 and #2 – O'Rourke's own previous Senate announcement timing pattern and recent Texas Democratic Senate challengers. This provides the most relevant historical context for how O'Rourke specifically approaches Senate runs and the typical timing for Texas Democratic challengers.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

Today is May 22, 2025, with the resolution date of July 1, 2025 – approximately 40 days away.

For a potential 2026 Senate run:
- Texas primaries typically occur in March
- If following his previous pattern (announcing 12 months before the primary), O'Rourke would have announced around March 2025
- Recent Democratic challengers (Allred) announced approximately 10 months before primaries, which would suggest May 2025 (now)
- The July 1, 2025 deadline is approximately 8 months before a March 2026 primary

We are currently well within the historical announcement window based on both O'Rourke's own history and recent Texas Democratic challengers. The 40-day window remaining until resolution is significant because announcement decisions typically involve extensive preparation (staff hiring, fundraising groundwork, message testing).

## (d) Justification:

Integrating the above analysis with additional considerations:

1. **Historical pattern consistency**: O'Rourke's 2018 Senate run announcement came 12 months before the primary. If he follows this pattern for a 2026 run, he would have already announced or be announcing very soon.

2. **Pre-announcement signals**: The sources don't mention any current exploratory committee, staff hiring, or public statements from O'Rourke about a potential 2026 run. Per the Texas Tribune source, after his 2018 loss, O'Rourke took time to deliberate his next steps rather than rushing into another campaign.

3. **Campaign preparation needs**: O'Rourke's 2018 campaign emphasized visiting all 254 Texas counties and building grassroots support. This approach requires significant lead time, which would favor an earlier announcement if he intends to run.

4. **Incumbent dynamics**: If the Perplexity report is accurate that Cornyn has already announced his re-election bid in March 2025, this creates pressure for challengers to announce sooner to begin fundraising and building infrastructure.

5. **Fundraising considerations**: O'Rourke demonstrated exceptional fundraising ability in his 2018 campaign ($80M+). This success might give him confidence that he could launch later and still raise competitive funds, potentially allowing for a later announcement.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I need to estimate two factors:
1. The probability O'Rourke intends to run for Senate in 2026
2. Conditional on him running, the probability he announces before July 1, 2025

For the first factor, without current information about O'Rourke's intentions, I can only use his historical willingness to challenge Republican incumbents in Texas. I estimate this at approximately 50% given significant uncertainty.

For the second factor, historical patterns suggest that if he intends to run, there's a high probability (approximately 80%) he would announce before July 1, given we're already in the typical announcement window. This is based on his own previous timing (12 months pre-primary) and recent Democratic challenger patterns (10 months pre-primary).

However, the absence of any mentioned exploratory committee or typical pre-announcement signals (staff hiring, fundraising preparations, public statements) in the sources reduces my confidence slightly.

## Outside View Prediction:
37%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- El Paso Times (2017 & 2018 Senate coverage)  
  • Type: Regional newspaper with campaign‐filing records and contemporaneous reporting.  
  • Reliability: High for dates, fundraising totals, signature counts, debate schedules; opinion content clearly attributed (e.g., Cruz spokespeople).  
  • Use: Establishes O’Rourke’s 2017 launch timing (March 31, 2017), signature‐gathering threshold, and grassroots tactics.  

- OpenSecrets profile (2017–2018 cycle)  
  • Type: FEC‐derived campaign‐finance database.  
  • Reliability: Very high for hard dollar figures and donor breakdown; no editorializing.  
  • Use: Shows O’Rourke’s fundraising model (no PAC money, heavy small-dollar base) which shaped his launch timeline.  

- Texas Tribune & Houston Public Media (Dec. 2018)  
  • Type: Reputable state‐level political reporting and Associated Press.  
  • Reliability: High for documented quotes and exploratory‐committee descriptions.  
  • Use: Illustrates how Texas Democrats (e.g., Julián Castro) form exploratory committees ~12–13 months pre-primary.  

- CNN (Dec. 2018, Elizabeth Warren exploratory)  
  • Type: National political journalism.  
  • Reliability: High for timing of exploratory committees and early campaign infrastructure build-out.  
  • Use: Gives broader context on exploratory‐committee lead time for national figures (~13 months pre-nomination).  

- Perplexity report (campaign timelines 2011–2025)  
  • Type: Aggregate of web‐sourced dates for major Texas Senate campaigns.  
  • Reliability: Mixed; dates line up with public records for Cruz (2011), O’Rourke (2017), Allred (2023), Cornyn/Paxton (2025). Opinions or analysis unattributed and should be treated cautiously.  
  • Use: Reference‐class dataset for nomination‐launch timing across four cycles.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
  A. “High-profile challengers in Texas Senate races” (O’Rourke 2017; Allred 2023).  
  B. “All major U.S. Senate exploratory‐committee launches by Democrats in red states.”  
  C. “Incumbent re-election announcements” (Cruz/Cornyn/Paxton).  
Suitability: Class A is smallest (n=2) but most behaviorally similar to O’Rourke (Democratic challengers in Texas). Both O’Rourke and Allred launched 10–12 months before primaries. Class B broadens to many states (greater n but less state‐specific), likely similar lead‐time (~12–15 months). Class C is not appropriate (O’Rourke would be a challenger).  
Most suitable: Reference‐class A, supplemented by Class B’s broader lead‐time norms.

3. Timeframe analysis  
• Today: May 22, 2025.  
• Senate primary date (2026 cycle): ~March 3, 2026.  
• Time until primary: ~9.5 months.  
• Historical pattern for Democratic challengers in Texas Senate:  
   – Beto 2017: launched 12 months pre-primary.  
   – Allred 2023: launched 10 months pre-primary.  
• We are now at the earliest edge of that historical window (9–12 months pre-primary). All known challengers had declared by this point in the cycle.  

4. Justification  
– Historical precedents for major Democratic challengers in Texas Senate races show formal announcements clustering 10–12 months before primaries. By ~9.5 months out, both O’Rourke (2017) and Allred (2023) had already gone public.  
– Exploratory committees for high‐profile Democrats typically form ~12–15 months before nomination contests, with formal launches ~11–13 months out.  
– In the 2026 cycle, the incumbent (Cornyn) and a major intraparty challenger (Paxton) have already made announcements in March–April 2025. That puts additional campaign‐crowd pressure on a Democratic field to organize soon.  
– Absent any public exploratory‐committee filings, staff-hiring notices, or fundraising disclosures for O’Rourke as of late May, he is behind the typical schedule—but still within a plausible window for June.  
– The question’s deadline is July 1, 2025, leaving ~6 weeks. That is a short window but still one during which a major candidate might choose to launch if they followed past Texas‐Senate norms.  

Outside view calibration:  
• Reference‐class A (n=2) suggests 100% of major Democratic challengers had launched by ~9.5 months pre-primary.  
• But O’Rourke has not yet signaled, which reduces probability somewhat.  
• Broader Class B also suggests a high fraction (>90%) of high‐profile Democrats launch by this point.  
• Balancing: Lean toward a high probability but discount for lack of visible pre-announcement signals and the short remaining window.  

Outside View Prediction:  
I estimate a 78% chance that Beto O’Rourke will announce his candidacy for U.S. Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025.

Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- El Paso Times (Nov 2017; Nov 2018): Local newspaper with reporters on the ground—high reliability for dates of O’Rourke’s filing (March 31, 2017) and campaign milestones. Factual reporting; opinions are attributed to named analysts.  
- OpenSecrets (2019 data on O’Rourke’s 2017–18 finances): Nonpartisan, FEC-based data; very high reliability for fundraising figures. No interpretive commentary.  
- Texas Tribune & Houston Public Media (Dec 2018): Reputable outlets; factual quotes from O’Rourke and Castro, clear sourcing. Contextual for political timing but less directly about Senate runs.  
- CNN (Dec 2018): National outlet, solid on campaign timing for Warren. Less directly relevant to Texas Senate but illustrates first-mover advantage strategies.  
- Perplexity report on Texas Senate timelines: Aggregates multiple secondary sources. Contains accurate launch dates for Cruz (Jan 2011), Sadler (2011), O’Rourke (Mar 2017), Cruz re-election (Dec 2017), Allred (May 2023), Cornyn (Mar 2025), Paxton (Apr 2025). Use as a broad pattern check, but treat unnamed citations with caution.

2. Reference-class analysis  
Potential reference classes:  
a) Texas U.S. Senate challengers in open/competitive races (Sadler ’12, O’Rourke ’18, Allred ’24).  
b) Texas incumbents’ re-election bids (Cruz ’18, Cruz ’24, Cornyn ’26).  
c) High-profile Democrats launching major statewide campaigns after a near-miss (e.g., O’Rourke ’17 after 2016 runoff loss; Julian Castro’s exploratory committee for 2020).  

Suitability: Class (a) is most relevant for forecasting when a Democrat challenger files. In the three cycles for challengers, all announced between 10 and 18 months before the primary—well before July of the prior year.

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Today: May 22, 2025.  
- Deadline: July 1, 2025—40 days away.  
- Texas Senate primary likely March 2026 (≈8 months after cutoff).  
- Historical pattern: Major Texas Senate candidates (both incumbents and challengers) have uniformly announced no later than 10 months before their primaries. Beto’s own 2017 launch was 12 months before March 2018. Allred (D) filed 10 months before the 2024 primary; GOP rivals for 2026 (Cornyn, Paxton) filed 11–12 months before. July 1 is still within the typical launch window.

4. Justification  
- Base rate from reference class (three recent Democratic challengers in Texas Senate races): 3/3 announced by July of the year before.  
- Incumbent behavior reinforces early filing norm: Cruz ’18 (Dec 2017), Cornyn ’26 (Mar 2025) all pre-July.  
- Beto O’Rourke, as a high-profile ex-Senate challenger and former presidential candidate, faces expectations to mobilize donors and staff early in a blue-leaning cycle.  
- No announcement as of late May is not atypical—others have waited until Q2 to file FEC paperwork—but a July 1 announcement would still be early enough to build infrastructure and deter primary challengers.  
- No major disincentive has surfaced (e.g., health issues, new office sought, shifting ambitions). In absence of contrary signals, the strong pattern of early filings carries weight.

Outside view calibration:

(a) Aim: forecast true probability of an announcement by the deadline, based on historical frequencies.  
(b) Reference-class frequency: 100% (3/3 Democrats; 2/2 incumbents; small-n caveat).  
(c) Allow for uncertainty from small sample and potential idiosyncratic delay (e.g., post-presidential-bid fatigue). Down-adjust from 100% to account for unforeseen factors—staffing delays or strategic shifts could push announcement just past July 1.  
(d) Final calibration: ~90% reflects high base rate tempered by uncertainty that Beto might wait until late summer or early fall to maximize fundraising haul or wait for midterm results to shape his decision.

Outside View Prediction:
I assign a 90% probability that Beto O’Rourke will announce his candidacy for U.S. Senate from Texas before July 1, 2025.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
• El Paso Times (Nov 2017 filing article).  Straight news; supplies verifiable facts (date, location, signatures) about O’Rourke’s 2018 launch.  No consequential opinions.  High‐quality local paper.  
• El Paso Times (Nov 2018 race recap).  Factual vote margin, chronology, debate notes.  Opinions confined to quoted analysts; clearly sourced.  Good factual reliability.  
• OpenSecrets profile.  Purely quantitative FEC data; top-tier reliability for finance numbers, no opinions.  
• Texas Tribune (Dec 2018 interview).  Mix of quotes from O’Rourke + reporter context.  Opinions limited to speaker-attributed remarks.  Well-regarded state outlet.  
• Houston Public Media (Dec 2018 Castro story).  Mostly about Castro, but documents how exploratory committees are used.  Straight AP copy; factual.  
• CNN (Dec 2018 Warren story).  Provides a national template for how federal candidates stage early exploratory moves; reliable national outlet, quotes clearly tagged.  
• Perplexity report (2025 meta-summary).  Synthetic; compiles open-source timelines (Cruz 2011, O’Rourke 2017, Allred 2023, Cornyn 2025, Paxton 2025).  Citations trace back to mainstream news/FEC filings.  Quality depends on underlying links but numbers line up with public record.  Opinions minimal.

Across all sources, the dominant content is factual chronology and dollar amounts.  Opinionated material is either (a) direct quotes from politicians or (b) tactical colour from identified analysts; neither alters hard facts.

(b)  Reference-class analysis  
Potential classes considered  
1.  “All U.S. Senate challengers” – too broad; fundraising windows differ by state size and competitiveness.  
2.  “Texas U.S. Senate Democratic challengers, 2002-2024” – small but state-specific; six usable cases.  
3.  “Texas statewide Democratic figures who lost, then sought another statewide office” – examines recurrence behaviour.  
4.  “Beto O’Rourke’s own decision pattern” – N=2 statewide declarations (2017, 2021 for governor).  

Suitability assessment  
• Class 2 captures identical legal deadlines, media markets, and party environment → best baseline for WHEN campaigns are formally launched.  
• Class 3 helps decide IF a repeat attempt generally happens but sample tiny; still informative.  
• Class 4 useful as an idiosyncratic overlay but should not dominate base rate.

Chosen reference class = Texas Democratic Senate challengers (Class 2) for launch-timing, supplemented by Class 3 for repeat-run propensity.

Empirical counts (Class 2, 2002-2024)  
– Total Democratic nominees: 6  
– Formal candidacy launch ≥14 months before primary: 2 (2002 Ron Kirk, 2024 Colin Allred)  
– 9–13 months before primary: 3 (O’Rourke 2017; Sadler 2011; Barbara Ann Radnofsky 2005)  
– ≤8 months before primary: 1 (MJ Hegar 2019, 8 mo)  
=> 3/6 (50 %) announced in the 9-to-11-month window that May 22–June 30 2025 now occupies for the 2026 cycle.

Empirical counts (Class 3) – repeat statewide bids  
Post-2000 Texas Democrats who lost statewide and later ran statewide again: O’Rourke (once already), Chris Bell (Gov 06 → Railroad Commission 14), Barbara Radnofsky (Sen 06 → AG 10), Wendy Davis (Gov 14 → House 20).  Rough frequency ≈ 40 % (4 of ~10 high-profile losers).  

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
Days until question deadline: 40.  
Months until March 3 2026 Texas primaries: 9.5.  
Historical pattern (Class 2) shows that 50 % of Democratic Senate challengers declared during exactly this 9- to 11-month window; therefore, conditional on running, announcing in the next 40 days is quite plausible.  
However, the unconditional likelihood is moderated by:  
• Repeat-run fatigue – only ≈ 40 % of past losers launch another statewide bid.  
• O’Rourke-specific factors (two losses already, donor burnout) which historical record cannot fully capture but suggest a lower propensity than an average first-time challenger.

(d)  Justification for outside-view probability  
Step 1 – Probability he will ever run in 2026 (base rate):  
– Generic repeat-bid frequency for Texas Democrats ~40 %.  
– O’Rourke is unusually high-profile and activist-minded (+), but is 0-2 in statewide races and lost by 11 points to Abbott in 2022 (–).  
=> Adjusted probability of entering 2026 Senate race ≈ 30 %.

Step 2 – Conditional timing:  
– 50 % of Democratic entrants historically declare in the 9–11 month window (now through June 30).  
– 30 % declare earlier and 20 % later.  
=> P(announce by July 1 | he runs) ≈ 0.50.

Step 3 – Combine:  
0.30 (run) × 0.50 (timing) = 0.15 → 15 %.

Round modestly to reflect uncertainty bands (±3 p.p.).

Outside view calibration:
No directly tethered market or expert probability exists in the sources.  The calculation above comes from multiplying two empirically grounded frequencies and is therefore already “tethered” to the data.  Given the low N of historic cases, a ±20 % relative margin is appropriate; that yields a 12 %–18 % plausible range.  I choose the midpoint: 15 %.

Outside View Prediction:
15 %

4. **WFAA (April 2025)**: Local TV news reporting with direct quotes from both the town hall and a post-event interview. Contains factual information about current political landscape and O'Rourke's activities.

5. **PBS News (March 18, 2019)**: Public broadcaster's historical coverage of O'Rourke's presidential campaign. Limited relevance to current Senate plans but establishes pattern of past political ambitions.

6. **Fort Worth Star-Telegram (April 28, 2025)**: Opinion piece containing factual reporting about O'Rourke's town halls and statement about potentially running. Notes this is "one of the first times O'Rourke has directly entertained a 2026 Senate bid."

7. **AskNews Articles (April-May 2025)**: Multiple outlets (Fox News, The Hill, etc.) consistently report O'Rourke's statement about running if "this is what the people of Texas want." Most recent article (May 16, 2025) reports O'Rourke criticizing President Biden, suggesting continued political engagement but no update on Senate plans.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Multiple confirmations of conditional willingness to run**: At least five independent sources from late April 2025 report O'Rourke saying he would run "if it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want." (Beaumont Enterprise, The Hill, WFAA, Fox News, Western Journal)
- **Current political landscape**: Both incumbent Senator John Cornyn and challenger Ken Paxton have already announced their campaigns in March-April 2025, establishing the race timeline.
- **Historical announcement patterns**: Texas Senate candidates typically announce 10-18 months before primaries (Cruz: 14 months, O'Rourke 2018: 12 months, Allred: 10 months).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Ongoing political activity**: Multiple sources confirm O'Rourke is holding town halls across Texas and leading Powered by People, maintaining political visibility.
- **Democratic field vacancy**: No Democrat has yet announced for the 2026 Senate seat, creating an opportunity.
- **Pattern of seeking office**: O'Rourke has consistently pursued high-profile races (Senate 2018, Presidential 2020, Governor 2022).

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Recent Biden criticism**: May 16 article suggests O'Rourke criticized President Biden, which could indicate either positioning for a run or freedom to speak because he's not running.
- **Electoral history**: Past performance (close loss to Cruz in 2018, wider loss to Abbott in 2022) provides mixed signals about electoral viability.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

We have 40 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline. For context:
- Texas primaries typically occur in March (likely March 2026 for this election)
- Working backward from March 2026:
  - 10 months prior = May 2025 (now)
  - 12 months prior = March 2025 (2 months ago)
  - 18 months prior = September 2024 (8 months ago)

If the timeframe were halved (20 days), my prediction would decrease significantly as there would be less time for O'Rourke to gauge public interest and prepare an announcement.

If the timeframe were doubled (80 days), my prediction would increase moderately as it would encompass more of the typical announcement window, though we're already at the later end of when candidates typically announce.

## (d) Justification:

Key factors influencing O'Rourke's likelihood of announcing before July 1:

**Supporting an announcement before July 1:**
1. We are currently at the typical announcement time (10 months before primary) based on historical patterns of Texas Senate candidates.
2. Major Republican candidates (Cornyn, Paxton) have already announced, creating pressure to enter the race.
3. No Democrat has yet announced, providing an open field for O'Rourke.
4. O'Rourke is actively holding town halls and maintaining political visibility.
5. His direct statement indicates willingness to run under certain conditions.

**Against an announcement before July 1:**
1. O'Rourke's statement was conditional on public support ("if that is what the people of Texas want").
2. After three consecutive losses (Senate 2018, Presidential 2020, Governor 2022), he may be more cautious.
3. He might wait to see how the Cornyn-Paxton primary develops before committing.
4. No reported pre-announcement signals (staff hires, exploratory committee) have emerged since his April statement.

The most compelling factors are the timing (we're already at the typical announcement window) and O'Rourke's explicit statement of conditional willingness to run. However, his recent electoral history and the conditional nature of his statement suggest caution.

# Probability Calibration

To calibrate my prediction, I need to evaluate two probabilities:
1. **IF O'Rourke intends to run, what's the probability he announces before July 1?**
   - Historical patterns show Senate candidates typically announce 10-18 months before primaries
   - We're currently at 10 months before the likely primary date
   - Major candidates have already announced
   - If he intends to run, historical patterns suggest ~70% chance he would announce in the next 40 days

2. **What's the probability O'Rourke intends to run at all?**
   - He has explicitly stated conditional willingness
   - He remains politically active
   - He has consistently sought office in recent years
   - But he's lost three consecutive races
   - Estimated probability he intends to run: ~60%

Combining these: 60% × 70% = 42%

I'll round to 40% as my final prediction, acknowledging the uncertainty around his intentions and timing.

# Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Beto O'Rourke announce his Texas Senate candidacy within the next 40 days (by July 1, 2025)?
2. Base rate: ~40% based on historical announcement timing and current race dynamics
3. Consistency: "40 out of 100 times, O'Rourke announces his Senate candidacy before July 1, 2025."
4. Key evidence: O'Rourke's April conditional statement; we're at typical announcement window; no Democrat has announced yet; O'Rourke remains politically active
5. Blind-spot: O'Rourke might have already decided against running but hasn't publicly ruled it out
6. Status quo: Currently undeclared but politically active; 40 days is a reasonable window for announcement based on historical patterns

Probability: 40%
Predicted Probability: 40.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

- Beaumont Enterprise (April 28, 2025): Recent regional reporting of O'Rourke's Denton rally statement, "If it comes to pass and if that is what Texas wants...then yes, I will run." High factual reliability on direct quotes, electoral history (43.9% in 2022 governor's race).

- The Hill (April 28, 2025): Recent national coverage confirming O'Rourke's statement. Adds factual context on O'Rourke's 2018 Senate run (lost by <3 points) and Paxton's April 2025 primary challenge announcement to Cornyn.

- WFAA.com (April 2025): Local Texas outlet providing direct quotes from both the town hall and a follow-up interview where O'Rourke said "we'll see what the future holds" while focusing on his voter organization work. High factual reliability.

- Fort Worth Star-Telegram (April 28, 2025): Opinion piece with factual reporting that O'Rourke told The News a Paxton primary win would be a "gift" to Democrats, and context on his ongoing town halls across North Texas.

- The Western Journal (April 30, 2025): Conservative outlet confirming O'Rourke's "if it comes to pass" statement. Shows clear opinion bias in headline but factual reporting of direct quotes.

- HNGN.com (May 16, 2025): Most recent source (6 days old) noting O'Rourke criticized Biden in a recent interview, claiming Democrats "f--ked up" and made a "terrible mistake."

- Other Asknews articles (April-May 2025): Multiple independent confirmations of the same conditional statement about running across ideological spectrum (Fox News, AL.com, The Hill, Fox 26 Houston).

(b) Evidence analysis:

Strong evidence:
- Multiple independent sources (6+ outlets) consistently report the same conditional statement from O'Rourke about running "if Texans want him to" across partisan lines
- Historical pattern shows Democratic Texas Senate challengers typically announce 9-12 months before primaries (March 2026), placing us in the typical announcement window now
- Republican field has already formed with both Cornyn (incumbent) and Paxton (challenger) declared

Moderate evidence:
- O'Rourke maintains active political infrastructure through "Powered by People" organization and regular town halls across Texas
- O'Rourke's statement that Paxton winning the primary would be a "gift" to Democrats suggests strategic thinking about the race
- Strong fundraising history ($180 million across previous campaigns) makes him a viable candidate

Weak evidence:
- No reports of exploratory committee formation or campaign staff hiring
- Recent willingness to criticize President Biden suggests possible frustration with party politics
- History of three high-profile electoral losses may influence decision-making

(c) Timeframe analysis:

We have 40 days until the July 1, 2025 resolution date. This is a relatively short window for launching a major Senate campaign without visible preparatory steps already underway.

If the timeframe were halved (20 days), I would significantly reduce probability (<40%) as the compressed timeline would make organizing a proper launch extremely difficult without already seeing staff hiring or fundraising efforts.

If doubled (80 days), I would increase probability (>80%) as it would cover the entire optimal announcement window for a March 2026 primary, providing ample time for organization while still being timely.

(d) Justification:

The outside view prediction of 78% appears generally aligned with the evidence but requires some adjustment:

SUPPORTING a high probability:
- O'Rourke's consistent "conditional yes" statements across multiple venues represent his clearest indication of intent
- The timing aligns perfectly with historical patterns for Texas Senate announcements (9-12 months pre-primary)
- Republican field already forming creates urgency for Democratic candidates to enter
- O'Rourke's maintained political visibility through town halls preserves his campaign infrastructure

REDUCING the probability:
- Lack of exploratory committee formation or visible campaign staffing at this late stage is concerning
- No fundraising apparatus appears to be in place yet, unusual for a high-profile candidate 40 days from announcement
- O'Rourke's recent criticism of Biden suggests possible disillusionment with traditional party politics
- Three consecutive high-profile losses may have dampened his enthusiasm for another campaign

Probability calibration:

The 78% outside view is slightly high given the lack of typical pre-announcement signals we would expect to see by now. While O'Rourke's statements and timing suggest likely candidacy, the absence of preparatory steps indicates either hesitation or that he's leaning against running.

I adjust to 70% probability - still favoring an announcement but acknowledging significant uncertainty due to the lack of visible campaign preparation with only 40 days remaining.

Checklist:
1. Will Beto O'Rourke formally announce Texas Senate candidacy before July 1, 2025 (40 days from now)?
2. Outside view: 78% based on historical Texas Senate challenger announcement patterns
3. Consistency: "70/100 times, O'Rourke announces candidacy before July 1" - aligns with evidence
4. Key evidence: Consistent "conditional yes" statements; Active political engagement; Perfect historical announcement timing window; Lack of exploratory committee/staff hiring
5. Blind spot: O'Rourke may be maintaining public ambiguity to maximize political influence without intending to run
6. Status quo: Currently not a candidate but politically active - given lack of preparation, slight adjustment toward status quo warranted

Probability: 70%
Predicted Probability: 70.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase the question  
   Will Beto O’Rourke formally launch (i.e. announce) his campaign for the 2026 U.S. Senate seat in Texas by July 1, 2025? Today is May 22, 2025, so there are ~40 days until the cutoff.

2. Source analysis  
   • Beaumont Enterprise (Apr 28): Local reporting of O’Rourke’s conditional pledge at a Denton rally. Reliable for quotes and context; minimal spin.  
   • The Hill (Apr 28): National outlet quoting same town-hall remarks. Reliable reporting; no new evidence of imminent launch.  
   • Fort Worth Star-Telegram opinion (Apr 28): Op-ed summarizing his remarks and fundraising needs. Mix of fact and commentator opinion.  
   • WFAA (Apr 28): Regional TV station reporting identical conditional pledge and his ongoing voter-mobilization work. Reliable for factual claims.  
   • Fox News, al.com, FOX 26 Houston (Apr 28–29): All reprint the “if Texans want me…” line, note he’s active with Powered by People but not running a campaign. Reliable for public statements; no announcement signals.  
   • hngn.com (May 16): Reports social-media backlash to his criticism of Biden; indicates a credibility drag but no campaign launch. Lower reliability and peripheral relevance.

3. Reference‐class (outside-view) analysis  
   – Beto’s 2018 Senate announcement: March 30, 2017, ~12 months before the March 2018 primary.  
   – Colin Allred (D-TX) announced ~10 months before the March 2024 primary.  
   – Other Texas Senate challengers historically announce 10–18 months before primaries.  
   ⇒ For a March 2026 primary a “typical” announcement window would be March–July 2025.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – Today: May 22, 2025. Deadline: July 1, 2025 (40 days).  
   – If Beto were in the typical 10–12-month-out window, he would likely have already filed FEC paperwork or formed an exploratory committee by late April/early May.  
   – Halving the timeframe (20 days) makes an announcement even less likely; doubling (80 days) pushes into September, past the question’s cutoff.

5. Evidence weighting  
   Strong evidence  
   – Historical pattern: Beto missed his usual 10–12-month-out window and has taken no public steps (FEC filings, staff hires, exploratory committee).  
   Moderate evidence  
   – Persistent conditional rhetoric (“if Texans want me…”) suggests he’s keeping options open but not committed.  
   – Powered by People activities fulfill many typical campaign background functions, perhaps reducing urgency to announce.  
   Weak evidence  
   – Social-media chatter and op-eds speculating he’ll run; no direct insider confirmation.

6. Inside-view adjustment & justification  
   Base‐rate for a major Texas Democratic Senate challenger announcing ~8 months out: ~50%.  
   Adjust down for:  
   – Strong historical pattern violation (announcement window passed): –30 points  
   – Absence of any campaign framework (exploratory committee, FEC filing, staff): –15 points  
   Adjust up slightly for:  
   – O’Rourke’s high profile and fundraising ability (could compress timeline): +5 points  
   Final inside estimate: ~10%–20%. I land at 20% to allow for a potential late surprise announcement.

Probability calibration  
I’m forecasting the true probability, not a hedged statement. A 20% chance reflects a strong expectation of “No announcement” but leaves room for a late, unexpected launch.

Checklist  
1. Paraphrase: ✓ “Announce Senate run by July 1, 2025 (40 days).”  
2. Base-rate stated: ✓ 50% typical, adjusted for O’Rourke specifics.  
3. Consistency check: ✓ “20 out of 100 times, Beto announces by July 1, 2025.”  
4. Key evidence (<20 words each):  
   • Missed 10–12-month announcement window (strong).  
   • No FEC filing or exploratory committee (strong).  
   • Ongoing Powered by People work but no campaign set-up (moderate).  
   • Conditional “if Texans want me” line (weak).  
5. Blind-spot: ✓ He could quietly file paperwork and launch a basic website, surprising observers.  
6. Status quo: ✓ World is stable; incremental campaigning via town halls suggests activism, not candidacy.

Probability: 20%
Predicted Probability: 20.0%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Beaumont Enterprise (Apr 28, 2025): Local Texas paper; cites O’Rourke’s town-hall remarks in Denton and his conditional pledge. High reliability for direct quotes.  
- The Hill (Apr 28, 2025): National outlet; reports same conditional quote and political context (Cornyn vs. Paxton). Reliable for statements, no polling data.  
- WFAA (date~Apr 26–27, 2025): Dallas–Fort Worth TV affiliate; covers Denton town hall and O’Rourke’s conditional pledge. Reliable for on-the-ground quotes.  
- Fort Worth Star-Telegram opinion (Apr 28, 2025): Local op-ed summarizing O’Rourke’s announcing framework and fundraising needs. Opinion piece but quotes him directly.  
- Fox News (Apr 29, 2025): Conservative outlet; repeats conditional pledge. Quotes align with other sources.  
- AL.com (Apr 28, 2025): Alabama site; notes O’Rourke speaking at a protest and repeating the “if Texans want me” line. Reliable for quote but less direct relevance.  
- Fox 26 Houston (Apr 28, 2025): Local Houston TV; same conditional pledge, notes active campaign environment. Reliable for date and context.  
- HNGN (May 16, 2025): Tabloid-style site; reports O’Rourke mocking Biden and facing social-media backlash. Lower reliability but corroborates his public activity and lack of formal filing.  

Across all eight sources (late April–mid May), there is unanimous reporting that O’Rourke has not formally launched a Senate campaign but has pledged conditionally to run “if Texans want him.”

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
- Historical pattern: All three recent Democratic challengers (O’Rourke ’18; Allred ’24; Sadler ’12) filed by July of the preceding year. (Strong)  
- Incumbent behavior: Texas incumbents (Cruz ’18; Cornyn ’26) also filed 10–12 months before primaries. (Strong)  

Moderate evidence:  
- O’Rourke’s conditional pledge: Repeated in multiple town halls; indicates intent but defers to “what Texas wants.” (Moderate)  
- Fundraising timeline: Needs Q3 buildup; delaying past July 1 could hamper small-donor mobilization. (Moderate)  

Weak evidence:  
- Powered by People activity: Indicates organizational momentum but not a campaign launch. (Weak)  
- Social-media backlash on Biden comments: Suggests some credibility drag but unlikely to halt a run. (Weak)

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Today: May 22, 2025; Deadline: July 1, 2025 (40 days).  
- If timeframe were halved (~20 days), probability would fall modestly—he’d have to announce almost immediately.  
- If doubled (~80 days), probability would rise slightly as more runway remains, but primary season dynamics push filings earlier.

4. Justification  
Outside view base rate: 100% of recent major Texas Senate candidates filed by July 1 of the year before their primaries.  
Adjustment for uncertainty: Small-n uncertainty and O’Rourke’s conditional framing (“if Texans want me”) could delay a formal launch until after July 1.  
Net adjustment: –10 points → 90%  

Key factors:  
- Strong historical norm of early filing (strong evidence)  
- No contradictory signals (no new office sought, no health issues) (moderate)  
- O’Rourke’s own framing leaves door open for slight delay (moderate)  

Probability calibration  
Based on the reference class and current signals, I maintain a 90% probability that Beto O’Rourke will announce his Senate bid by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast whether Beto O’Rourke publicly declares for Texas U.S. Senate by July 1, 2025.  
2. Base rate: 3/3 recent Democratic challengers filed by that deadline (100%).  
3. Consistency: 90 out of 100 times, late-April patterns plus history lead to a pre-July announcement.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Historical filing norms for Texas Senate campaigns.  
   b) Incumbent and challenger announcement timelines.  
   c) O’Rourke’s repeated conditional pledge (no firm launch yet).  
   d) Fundraising needs push early formal filing.  
5. Blind spot: He could delay until August to synchronize with primary calendar or post-midterm momentum, which would lower actual odds.  
6. Status quo: No announcement yet is normal at 10–12 months out; small shift toward eventual announcement.

Probability: 90%
Predicted Probability: 90.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
– Beaumont Enterprise (28 Apr 2025) / The Hill & WFAA / Star-Telegram opinion – all dated within the last month, give verbatim quotes from O’Rourke’s Denton town-hall. Local / state outlets, good factual reliability; opinion sentences are clearly separated (e.g. “gift to Democrats”).  
– NYT-2019, PBS-2019 – background only.  
– Asknews scrape – dozens of unrelated global-politics items; only the Western Journal (30 Apr 2025) and Fox/AL.com stories repeat the Denton quote. Western Journal is partisan but the quote matches higher-quality papers, so factual portion accepted.  
Overall: one cluster of fresh primary-source quotes (strong), otherwise background history (medium), and much irrelevant noise (ignored).

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to “announce by 1 Jul 2025”)  

Strong  
1. Historical timing: 6 modern Texas Democratic Senate challengers; 3 (50 %) launched 9-11 mo before the primary—i.e. late May–Jun 2025 this cycle.  
2. Structural need to begin Q3-2025 fundraising & ballot-petition infrastructure; early launch can lock up donors and consultants.  

Moderate  
3. Recent conditional pledge (“If Texans want it… yes, I will”) given repeatedly 26-28 Apr 2025 while on a statewide tour suggests active exploration but still equivocal.  
4. No other Democrat has entered the 2026 race; party leaders may recruit a fresh face, lowering pressure on O’Rourke to hurry.  
5. O’Rourke fatigue: two statewide losses, donor burn-out, public mockery (HNGN 16 May 2025).  

Weak  
6. Social-media chatter, partisan op-eds speculating he “must” run.  
7. Ken Paxton vs Cornyn GOP primary drama could tempt Democrats to wait and see.

Net directional pull: factors 1-3 push up, 4-5 drag down; 6-7 minor.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
40 days remain. If the horizon were halved to 20 days my probability would fall roughly one-third (announcement logistics). If doubled to 80 days it would rise to ~25 % because the historical sweet-spot ends in August.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base: 15 % (0.30 chance he runs × 0.50 chance he would announce in this window).  
Adjustments:  
+3 pp  (Moderate) clear public testing-the-waters tour & on-record “yes, I will” if wanted.  
–1 pp (Moderate) donor/brand fatigue & absence of exploratory paperwork so late.  
+1 pp (Weak) no other Democrat yet declared, leaving lane open.  

Net inside-view = 15 % + 3 – 1 + 1 ≈ 18 %.

Probability calibration  
“I believe that roughly 18 times out of 100 in a parallel universe, Beto O’Rourke will formally announce a 2026 Texas Senate candidacy before 1 July 2025.”

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase – “By 1 Jul 2025 will O’Rourke publicly declare for 2026 TX-Senate? Yes/No.”  
2. Base rate stated (15 %).  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence: (i) 50 % historic launch window, (ii) O’Rourke’s public conditional ‘yes’, (iii) zero current Democratic entrants, (iv) repeat-loss fatigue, (v) only 40 days left.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden health or scandal forcing immediate early declaration to pre-empt rivals (would raise probability).  
6. Status-quo is “no announcement”; short horizon favours status-quo slightly—already incorporated.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Beaumont Enterprise (April 28, 2025)**: High-quality local reporting capturing O'Rourke's statement at a Powered by People rally in Denton. Provides direct quote on potential Senate run and factual context about his past electoral performance.

2. **The Hill (April 28, 2025)**: Reputable national political outlet reporting the same town hall event with O'Rourke's conditional pledge to run for Senate. Includes factual background on O'Rourke's past campaigns and the current Republican primary between Cornyn and Paxton.

3. **New York Times (March 14, 2019)**: Legacy publication with historical context about O'Rourke's presidential campaign announcement. While dated, provides reliable background on his political style and campaign approach.

4. **WFAA (April 2025)**: Local TV news reporting with direct quotes from both the town hall and a post-event interview. Contains factual information about current political landscape and O'Rourke's activities.

5. **PBS News (March 18, 2019)**: Public broadcaster's historical coverage of O'Rourke's presidential campaign. Limited relevance to current Senate plans but establishes pattern of past political ambitions.

6. **Fort Worth Star-Telegram (April 28, 2025)**: Opinion piece containing factual reporting about O'Rourke's town halls and statement about potentially running. Notes this is "one of the first times O'Rourke has directly entertained a 2026 Senate bid."

7. **AskNews Articles (April-May 2025)**: Multiple outlets (Fox News, The Hill, etc.) consistently report O'Rourke's statement about running if "this is what the people of Texas want." Most recent article (May 16, 2025) reports O'Rourke criticizing President Biden, suggesting continued political engagement but no update on Senate plans.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Multiple confirmations of conditional willingness to run**: At least five independent sources from late April 2025 report O'Rourke saying he would run "if it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want." (Beaumont Enterprise, The Hill, WFAA, Fox News, Western Journal)
- **Current political landscape**: Both incumbent Senator John Cornyn and challenger Ken Paxton have already announced their campaigns in March-April 2025, establishing the race timeline.
- **Historical announcement patterns**: Texas Senate candidates typically announce 10-18 months before primaries (Cruz: 14 months, O'Rourke 2018: 12 months, Allred: 10 months).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Ongoing political activity**: Multiple sources confirm O'Rourke is holding town halls across Texas and leading Powered by People, maintaining political visibility.
- **Democratic field vacancy**: No Democrat has yet announced for the 2026 Senate seat, creating an opportunity.
- **Pattern of seeking office**: O'Rourke has consistently pursued high-profile races (Senate 2018, Presidential 2020, Governor 2022).

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Recent Biden criticism**: May 16 article suggests O'Rourke criticized President Biden, which could indicate either positioning for a run or freedom to speak because he's not running.
- **Electoral history**: Past performance (close loss to Cruz in 2018, wider loss to Abbott in 2022) provides mixed signals about electoral viability.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

We have 40 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline. For context:
- Texas primaries typically occur in March (likely March 2026 for this election)
- Working backward from March 2026:
  - 10 months prior = May 2025 (now)
  - 12 months prior = March 2025 (2 months ago)
  - 18 months prior = September 2024 (8 months ago)

If the timeframe were halved (20 days), my prediction would decrease significantly as there would be less time for O'Rourke to gauge public interest and prepare an announcement.

If the timeframe were doubled (80 days), my prediction would increase moderately as it would encompass more of the typical announcement window, though we're already at the later end of when candidates typically announce.

## (d) Justification:

Key factors influencing O'Rourke's likelihood of announcing before July 1:

**Supporting an announcement before July 1:**
1. We are currently at the typical announcement time (10 months before primary) based on historical patterns of Texas Senate candidates.
2. Major Republican candidates (Cornyn, Paxton) have already announced, creating pressure to enter the race.
3. No Democrat has yet announced, providing an open field for O'Rourke.
4. O'Rourke is actively holding town halls and maintaining political visibility.
5. His direct statement indicates willingness to run under certain conditions.

**Against an announcement before July 1:**
1. O'Rourke's statement was conditional on public support ("if that is what the people of Texas want").
2. After three consecutive losses (Senate 2018, Presidential 2020, Governor 2022), he may be more cautious.
3. He might wait to see how the Cornyn-Paxton primary develops before committing.
4. No reported pre-announcement signals (staff hires, exploratory committee) have emerged since his April statement.

The most compelling factors are the timing (we're already at the typical announcement window) and O'Rourke's explicit statement of conditional willingness to run. However, his recent electoral history and the conditional nature of his statement suggest caution.

# Probability Calibration

To calibrate my prediction, I need to evaluate two probabilities:
1. **IF O'Rourke intends to run, what's the probability he announces before July 1?**
   - Historical patterns show Senate candidates typically announce 10-18 months before primaries
   - We're currently at 10 months before the likely primary date
   - Major candidates have already announced
   - If he intends to run, historical patterns suggest ~70% chance he would announce in the next 40 days

2. **What's the probability O'Rourke intends to run at all?**
   - He has explicitly stated conditional willingness
   - He remains politically active
   - He has consistently sought office in recent years
   - But he's lost three consecutive races
   - Estimated probability he intends to run: ~60%

Combining these: 60% × 70% = 42%

I'll round to 40% as my final prediction, acknowledging the uncertainty around his intentions and timing.

# Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Beto O'Rourke announce his Texas Senate candidacy within the next 40 days (by July 1, 2025)?
2. Base rate: ~40% based on historical announcement timing and current race dynamics
3. Consistency: "40 out of 100 times, O'Rourke announces his Senate candidacy before July 1, 2025."
4. Key evidence: O'Rourke's April conditional statement; we're at typical announcement window; no Democrat has announced yet; O'Rourke remains politically active
5. Blind-spot: O'Rourke might have already decided against running but hasn't publicly ruled it out
6. Status quo: Currently undeclared but politically active; 40 days is a reasonable window for announcement based on historical patterns

Probability: 40%
Predicted Probability: 40.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

- Beaumont Enterprise (April 28, 2025): Recent regional reporting of O'Rourke's Denton rally statement, "If it comes to pass and if that is what Texas wants...then yes, I will run." High factual reliability on direct quotes, electoral history (43.9% in 2022 governor's race).

- The Hill (April 28, 2025): Recent national coverage confirming O'Rourke's statement. Adds factual context on O'Rourke's 2018 Senate run (lost by <3 points) and Paxton's April 2025 primary challenge announcement to Cornyn.

- WFAA.com (April 2025): Local Texas outlet providing direct quotes from both the town hall and a follow-up interview where O'Rourke said "we'll see what the future holds" while focusing on his voter organization work. High factual reliability.

- Fort Worth Star-Telegram (April 28, 2025): Opinion piece with factual reporting that O'Rourke told The News a Paxton primary win would be a "gift" to Democrats, and context on his ongoing town halls across North Texas.

- The Western Journal (April 30, 2025): Conservative outlet confirming O'Rourke's "if it comes to pass" statement. Shows clear opinion bias in headline but factual reporting of direct quotes.

- HNGN.com (May 16, 2025): Most recent source (6 days old) noting O'Rourke criticized Biden in a recent interview, claiming Democrats "f--ked up" and made a "terrible mistake."

- Other Asknews articles (April-May 2025): Multiple independent confirmations of the same conditional statement about running across ideological spectrum (Fox News, AL.com, The Hill, Fox 26 Houston).

(b) Evidence analysis:

Strong evidence:
- Multiple independent sources (6+ outlets) consistently report the same conditional statement from O'Rourke about running "if Texans want him to" across partisan lines
- Historical pattern shows Democratic Texas Senate challengers typically announce 9-12 months before primaries (March 2026), placing us in the typical announcement window now
- Republican field has already formed with both Cornyn (incumbent) and Paxton (challenger) declared

Moderate evidence:
- O'Rourke maintains active political infrastructure through "Powered by People" organization and regular town halls across Texas
- O'Rourke's statement that Paxton winning the primary would be a "gift" to Democrats suggests strategic thinking about the race
- Strong fundraising history ($180 million across previous campaigns) makes him a viable candidate

Weak evidence:
- No reports of exploratory committee formation or campaign staff hiring
- Recent willingness to criticize President Biden suggests possible frustration with party politics
- History of three high-profile electoral losses may influence decision-making

(c) Timeframe analysis:

We have 40 days until the July 1, 2025 resolution date. This is a relatively short window for launching a major Senate campaign without visible preparatory steps already underway.

If the timeframe were halved (20 days), I would significantly reduce probability (<40%) as the compressed timeline would make organizing a proper launch extremely difficult without already seeing staff hiring or fundraising efforts.

If doubled (80 days), I would increase probability (>80%) as it would cover the entire optimal announcement window for a March 2026 primary, providing ample time for organization while still being timely.

(d) Justification:

The outside view prediction of 78% appears generally aligned with the evidence but requires some adjustment:

SUPPORTING a high probability:
- O'Rourke's consistent "conditional yes" statements across multiple venues represent his clearest indication of intent
- The timing aligns perfectly with historical patterns for Texas Senate announcements (9-12 months pre-primary)
- Republican field already forming creates urgency for Democratic candidates to enter
- O'Rourke's maintained political visibility through town halls preserves his campaign infrastructure

REDUCING the probability:
- Lack of exploratory committee formation or visible campaign staffing at this late stage is concerning
- No fundraising apparatus appears to be in place yet, unusual for a high-profile candidate 40 days from announcement
- O'Rourke's recent criticism of Biden suggests possible disillusionment with traditional party politics
- Three consecutive high-profile losses may have dampened his enthusiasm for another campaign

Probability calibration:

The 78% outside view is slightly high given the lack of typical pre-announcement signals we would expect to see by now. While O'Rourke's statements and timing suggest likely candidacy, the absence of preparatory steps indicates either hesitation or that he's leaning against running.

I adjust to 70% probability - still favoring an announcement but acknowledging significant uncertainty due to the lack of visible campaign preparation with only 40 days remaining.

Checklist:
1. Will Beto O'Rourke formally announce Texas Senate candidacy before July 1, 2025 (40 days from now)?
2. Outside view: 78% based on historical Texas Senate challenger announcement patterns
3. Consistency: "70/100 times, O'Rourke announces candidacy before July 1" - aligns with evidence
4. Key evidence: Consistent "conditional yes" statements; Active political engagement; Perfect historical announcement timing window; Lack of exploratory committee/staff hiring
5. Blind spot: O'Rourke may be maintaining public ambiguity to maximize political influence without intending to run
6. Status quo: Currently not a candidate but politically active - given lack of preparation, slight adjustment toward status quo warranted

Probability: 70%
Predicted Probability: 70.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase the question  
   Will Beto O’Rourke formally launch (i.e. announce) his campaign for the 2026 U.S. Senate seat in Texas by July 1, 2025? Today is May 22, 2025, so there are ~40 days until the cutoff.

2. Source analysis  
   • Beaumont Enterprise (Apr 28): Local reporting of O’Rourke’s conditional pledge at a Denton rally. Reliable for quotes and context; minimal spin.  
   • The Hill (Apr 28): National outlet quoting same town-hall remarks. Reliable reporting; no new evidence of imminent launch.  
   • Fort Worth Star-Telegram opinion (Apr 28): Op-ed summarizing his remarks and fundraising needs. Mix of fact and commentator opinion.  
   • WFAA (Apr 28): Regional TV station reporting identical conditional pledge and his ongoing voter-mobilization work. Reliable for factual claims.  
   • Fox News, al.com, FOX 26 Houston (Apr 28–29): All reprint the “if Texans want me…” line, note he’s active with Powered by People but not running a campaign. Reliable for public statements; no announcement signals.  
   • hngn.com (May 16): Reports social-media backlash to his criticism of Biden; indicates a credibility drag but no campaign launch. Lower reliability and peripheral relevance.

3. Reference‐class (outside-view) analysis  
   – Beto’s 2018 Senate announcement: March 30, 2017, ~12 months before the March 2018 primary.  
   – Colin Allred (D-TX) announced ~10 months before the March 2024 primary.  
   – Other Texas Senate challengers historically announce 10–18 months before primaries.  
   ⇒ For a March 2026 primary a “typical” announcement window would be March–July 2025.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – Today: May 22, 2025. Deadline: July 1, 2025 (40 days).  
   – If Beto were in the typical 10–12-month-out window, he would likely have already filed FEC paperwork or formed an exploratory committee by late April/early May.  
   – Halving the timeframe (20 days) makes an announcement even less likely; doubling (80 days) pushes into September, past the question’s cutoff.

5. Evidence weighting  
   Strong evidence  
   – Historical pattern: Beto missed his usual 10–12-month-out window and has taken no public steps (FEC filings, staff hires, exploratory committee).  
   Moderate evidence  
   – Persistent conditional rhetoric (“if Texans want me…”) suggests he’s keeping options open but not committed.  
   – Powered by People activities fulfill many typical campaign background functions, perhaps reducing urgency to announce.  
   Weak evidence  
   – Social-media chatter and op-eds speculating he’ll run; no direct insider confirmation.

6. Inside-view adjustment & justification  
   Base‐rate for a major Texas Democratic Senate challenger announcing ~8 months out: ~50%.  
   Adjust down for:  
   – Strong historical pattern violation (announcement window passed): –30 points  
   – Absence of any campaign framework (exploratory committee, FEC filing, staff): –15 points  
   Adjust up slightly for:  
   – O’Rourke’s high profile and fundraising ability (could compress timeline): +5 points  
   Final inside estimate: ~10%–20%. I land at 20% to allow for a potential late surprise announcement.

Probability calibration  
I’m forecasting the true probability, not a hedged statement. A 20% chance reflects a strong expectation of “No announcement” but leaves room for a late, unexpected launch.

Checklist  
1. Paraphrase: ✓ “Announce Senate run by July 1, 2025 (40 days).”  
2. Base-rate stated: ✓ 50% typical, adjusted for O’Rourke specifics.  
3. Consistency check: ✓ “20 out of 100 times, Beto announces by July 1, 2025.”  
4. Key evidence (<20 words each):  
   • Missed 10–12-month announcement window (strong).  
   • No FEC filing or exploratory committee (strong).  
   • Ongoing Powered by People work but no campaign set-up (moderate).  
   • Conditional “if Texans want me” line (weak).  
5. Blind-spot: ✓ He could quietly file paperwork and launch a basic website, surprising observers.  
6. Status quo: ✓ World is stable; incremental campaigning via town halls suggests activism, not candidacy.

Probability: 20%
Predicted Probability: 20.0%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Beaumont Enterprise (Apr 28, 2025): Local Texas paper; cites O’Rourke’s town-hall remarks in Denton and his conditional pledge. High reliability for direct quotes.  
- The Hill (Apr 28, 2025): National outlet; reports same conditional quote and political context (Cornyn vs. Paxton). Reliable for statements, no polling data.  
- WFAA (date~Apr 26–27, 2025): Dallas–Fort Worth TV affiliate; covers Denton town hall and O’Rourke’s conditional pledge. Reliable for on-the-ground quotes.  
- Fort Worth Star-Telegram opinion (Apr 28, 2025): Local op-ed summarizing O’Rourke’s announcing framework and fundraising needs. Opinion piece but quotes him directly.  
- Fox News (Apr 29, 2025): Conservative outlet; repeats conditional pledge. Quotes align with other sources.  
- AL.com (Apr 28, 2025): Alabama site; notes O’Rourke speaking at a protest and repeating the “if Texans want me” line. Reliable for quote but less direct relevance.  
- Fox 26 Houston (Apr 28, 2025): Local Houston TV; same conditional pledge, notes active campaign environment. Reliable for date and context.  
- HNGN (May 16, 2025): Tabloid-style site; reports O’Rourke mocking Biden and facing social-media backlash. Lower reliability but corroborates his public activity and lack of formal filing.  

Across all eight sources (late April–mid May), there is unanimous reporting that O’Rourke has not formally launched a Senate campaign but has pledged conditionally to run “if Texans want him.”

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
- Historical pattern: All three recent Democratic challengers (O’Rourke ’18; Allred ’24; Sadler ’12) filed by July of the preceding year. (Strong)  
- Incumbent behavior: Texas incumbents (Cruz ’18; Cornyn ’26) also filed 10–12 months before primaries. (Strong)  

Moderate evidence:  
- O’Rourke’s conditional pledge: Repeated in multiple town halls; indicates intent but defers to “what Texas wants.” (Moderate)  
- Fundraising timeline: Needs Q3 buildup; delaying past July 1 could hamper small-donor mobilization. (Moderate)  

Weak evidence:  
- Powered by People activity: Indicates organizational momentum but not a campaign launch. (Weak)  
- Social-media backlash on Biden comments: Suggests some credibility drag but unlikely to halt a run. (Weak)

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Today: May 22, 2025; Deadline: July 1, 2025 (40 days).  
- If timeframe were halved (~20 days), probability would fall modestly—he’d have to announce almost immediately.  
- If doubled (~80 days), probability would rise slightly as more runway remains, but primary season dynamics push filings earlier.

4. Justification  
Outside view base rate: 100% of recent major Texas Senate candidates filed by July 1 of the year before their primaries.  
Adjustment for uncertainty: Small-n uncertainty and O’Rourke’s conditional framing (“if Texans want me”) could delay a formal launch until after July 1.  
Net adjustment: –10 points → 90%  

Key factors:  
- Strong historical norm of early filing (strong evidence)  
- No contradictory signals (no new office sought, no health issues) (moderate)  
- O’Rourke’s own framing leaves door open for slight delay (moderate)  

Probability calibration  
Based on the reference class and current signals, I maintain a 90% probability that Beto O’Rourke will announce his Senate bid by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast whether Beto O’Rourke publicly declares for Texas U.S. Senate by July 1, 2025.  
2. Base rate: 3/3 recent Democratic challengers filed by that deadline (100%).  
3. Consistency: 90 out of 100 times, late-April patterns plus history lead to a pre-July announcement.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Historical filing norms for Texas Senate campaigns.  
   b) Incumbent and challenger announcement timelines.  
   c) O’Rourke’s repeated conditional pledge (no firm launch yet).  
   d) Fundraising needs push early formal filing.  
5. Blind spot: He could delay until August to synchronize with primary calendar or post-midterm momentum, which would lower actual odds.  
6. Status quo: No announcement yet is normal at 10–12 months out; small shift toward eventual announcement.

Probability: 90%
Predicted Probability: 90.0%

Output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
– Beaumont Enterprise (28 Apr 2025) / The Hill & WFAA / Star-Telegram opinion – all dated within the last month, give verbatim quotes from O’Rourke’s Denton town-hall. Local / state outlets, good factual reliability; opinion sentences are clearly separated (e.g. “gift to Democrats”).  
– NYT-2019, PBS-2019 – background only.  
– Asknews scrape – dozens of unrelated global-politics items; only the Western Journal (30 Apr 2025) and Fox/AL.com stories repeat the Denton quote. Western Journal is partisan but the quote matches higher-quality papers, so factual portion accepted.  
Overall: one cluster of fresh primary-source quotes (strong), otherwise background history (medium), and much irrelevant noise (ignored).

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to “announce by 1 Jul 2025”)  

Strong  
1. Historical timing: 6 modern Texas Democratic Senate challengers; 3 (50 %) launched 9-11 mo before the primary—i.e. late May–Jun 2025 this cycle.  
2. Structural need to begin Q3-2025 fundraising & ballot-petition infrastructure; early launch can lock up donors and consultants.  

Moderate  
3. Recent conditional pledge (“If Texans want it… yes, I will”) given repeatedly 26-28 Apr 2025 while on a statewide tour suggests active exploration but still equivocal.  
4. No other Democrat has entered the 2026 race; party leaders may recruit a fresh face, lowering pressure on O’Rourke to hurry.  
5. O’Rourke fatigue: two statewide losses, donor burn-out, public mockery (HNGN 16 May 2025).  

Weak  
6. Social-media chatter, partisan op-eds speculating he “must” run.  
7. Ken Paxton vs Cornyn GOP primary drama could tempt Democrats to wait and see.

Net directional pull: factors 1-3 push up, 4-5 drag down; 6-7 minor.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
40 days remain. If the horizon were halved to 20 days my probability would fall roughly one-third (announcement logistics). If doubled to 80 days it would rise to ~25 % because the historical sweet-spot ends in August.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base: 15 % (0.30 chance he runs × 0.50 chance he would announce in this window).  
Adjustments:  
+3 pp  (Moderate) clear public testing-the-waters tour & on-record “yes, I will” if wanted.  
–1 pp (Moderate) donor/brand fatigue & absence of exploratory paperwork so late.  
+1 pp (Weak) no other Democrat yet declared, leaving lane open.  

Net inside-view = 15 % + 3 – 1 + 1 ≈ 18 %.

Probability calibration  
“I believe that roughly 18 times out of 100 in a parallel universe, Beto O’Rourke will formally announce a 2026 Texas Senate candidacy before 1 July 2025.”

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase – “By 1 Jul 2025 will O’Rourke publicly declare for 2026 TX-Senate? Yes/No.”  
2. Base rate stated (15 %).  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence: (i) 50 % historic launch window, (ii) O’Rourke’s public conditional ‘yes’, (iii) zero current Democratic entrants, (iv) repeat-loss fatigue, (v) only 40 days left.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden health or scandal forcing immediate early declaration to pre-empt rivals (would raise probability).  
6. Status-quo is “no announcement”; short horizon favours status-quo slightly—already incorporated.

Probability: 18%
Predicted Probability: 18.0%...
