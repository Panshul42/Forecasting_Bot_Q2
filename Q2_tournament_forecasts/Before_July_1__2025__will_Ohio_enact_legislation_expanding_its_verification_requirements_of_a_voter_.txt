Analysis:
To form an out-view baseline, I need data on how often U.S. states have passed “proof-of-citizenship” voter laws, in what years, and with what success or legal challenges. This lets me estimate the base rate of such laws nationwide. I also need Ohio-specific legislative history: prior bills like SB153’s progression, partisan control of the General Assembly, governor’s stance, and any past votes or referenda on similar measures. These details provide context for the current bill’s likelihood to pass before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:
We need the latest information on any bills introduced in the Ohio legislature (e.g. SB 153 or similar) that would require additional proof of U.S. citizenship to register or vote—including which chamber it’s in, committee referrals, hearing dates, floor votes, amendments, sponsor statements, and the Governor’s public stance or likely veto. We also want to track related election-integrity omnibus bills that might carry such provisions. This will allow us to update our base‐rate forecast with the inside‐view: how far has the legislation progressed, what opposition or support exists, and what the time pressure is before July 1, 2025.

<Summary source="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-passes-republican-bill-requiring-voters-provide-proof-of-u-s-citizenship">
Here’s a concise summary of the April 10, 2025 PBS News article “House passes Republican bill requiring voters provide proof of U.S. citizenship”:

• Legislation passed  
  – The U.S. House approved the “Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act,” which would require anyone using the federal voter-registration form to present documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in person at their local election office.  
  – Acceptable documents include a valid U.S. passport or a government-issued photo ID paired with a certified birth certificate.  

• Background & prospects  
  – This is Republicans’ second effort: an identical version passed the House last year but stalled in the Senate.  
  – Although the GOP now controls the Senate, they lack the 60-vote supermajority needed to overcome a filibuster, making enactment unlikely.  
  – The bill would codify aspects of former President Trump’s executive order, issued last month, that called for a citizenship requirement among other election reforms.  

• Data & precedent  
  – A 2023 Brennan Center report estimates 9% of voting-age U.S. citizens (about 21.3 million) lack readily available proof of citizenship; nearly half of Americans don’t have a passport.  
  – Kansas’s 2011 proof-of-citizenship law blocked over 31,000 eligible registrations before a federal court struck it down in 2018.  

• Key supporters & opponents  
  – Republicans, led in debate by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI), argue the bill “restores Americans’ confidence in our elections” by preventing noncitizen voting.  
  – Four Democrats crossed party lines to vote in favor: Reps. Ed Case (HI), Henry Cuellar (TX), Jared Golden (ME) and Marie Perez (WA).  
  – Nearly all Democrats opposed the measure, warning it would disproportionately disenfranchise:  
    • millions without easy access to documents,  
    • married women who’ve changed their names (an estimated 69 million),  
    • older citizens in care facilities, military personnel relying solely on military IDs, people of color and working-class Americans.  
  – Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY) said the bill would “force Americans into a paperwork nightmare,” and Rep. Deborah Ross (D-NC) warned of mass disenfranchisement of married women.  
  – Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes (D) called it “a solution in search of a problem,” noting noncitizen voting is rare and “capitalizing on fear…built on a lie.”  
  – Rep. Roy (R) credited GOP lawyer Cleta Mitchell, a figure in Trump’s post-2020 efforts, with helping draft the proposal.  

• Next steps  
  – The bill now moves to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain given the 60-vote threshold required to advance election legislation.

<Summary source="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id">
The article is a state‐by‐state compilation (sourced to the National Conference of State Legislatures) of in-person voter identification requirements and fallback procedures when voters lack ID.  It covers, in alphabetical order, the forms of ID each jurisdiction accepts and what happens if a voter can’t produce one.  Key points include:

• Alabama (§17-9-30)  
  – Accepts photo IDs such as state driver’s licenses or non-driver IDs, U.S. passports, military IDs, student IDs, tribal IDs, etc.  
  – Voters without ID may cast a provisional ballot (or a regular one if identified by two poll workers who swear affidavits) and then have until 5 p.m. the Friday after the election to show ID.

• Alaska (§15.15.225)  
  – Accepts voter registration cards, driver’s licenses, birth certificates, passports, hunting/fishing licenses, current utility bills, bank statements, paychecks, or other government documents with name/address.  
  – Officials may waive ID if they know the voter; otherwise the voter casts a “questioned” ballot.

• Arizona (§16-579(A))  
  – Accepts AZ driver’s licenses/non-driver IDs, tribal cards, any federal/state/local photo ID, recent utility bills or bank statements, vehicle registration, property tax statements, etc.  
  – Without ID, a voter receives a provisional ballot and must present ID to the county recorder—by 5 p.m. on the fifth business day after a federal election or third business day after any other—to have it counted.

• Arkansas (Amendment 51; §§7-1-101, 7-5-201, etc.)  
  – Photo ID required (driver’s licenses, photo cards, concealed-carry licenses, U.S. passports, military IDs, school IDs, public-assistance cards, voter verification cards).  
  – Digital IDs allowed if issued by the U.S., Arkansas or an accredited in-state postsecondary institution.  
  – Voters lacking ID may cast provisional ballots, which count only if ID is shown to the county clerk by noon the Monday after the election.

• Colorado (§1-1-104(19.5); §1-7-110)  
  – In-person voters (most Colorado voting is by mail) must show a photo ID (driver’s license, state ID, passport, government employee IDs, pilot’s license, military ID) or a recent utility bill/bank statement/government document, birth certificate, Medicare/Medicaid card, or naturalization papers.  
  – Without ID, voters cast provisional ballots; election officials verify eligibility before counting.

• Connecticut (§9-261)  
  – Accepts Social Security cards or any preprinted ID showing name plus address, signature or photo.  
  – Voter must also sign a form affirming under penalty of false statement that they are the registered elector.

• Delaware (Tit. 15, §4937)  
  – Requires photo ID, or utility bill, paycheck or other government document with name/address.  
  – Without ID, voter signs an affidavit of affirmation.

• Florida (§101.043)  
  – Accepts a wide range of current valid photo IDs: state driver’s licenses or IDs, passports, credit/debit cards, military, student, retirement-center, neighborhood-association, public-assistance or veteran health IDs, concealed-carry licenses, employee IDs.  
  – If the photo ID lacks a signature, a second ID with signature is required.  
  – Voters without ID cast provisional ballots; signature on the provisional‐ballot envelope is compared to the signature on file.

• Georgia (§21-2-417)  
  – Accepts Georgia driver’s licenses (even expired), state or federal agency IDs, free state/county voter IDs, U.S. passports, and employee IDs from any level of government.  
  – (The description cuts off here, but would include procedures for voters lacking ID.)

<Summary source="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/legislative-approaches-to-ensuring-only-citizens-vote">
Below is a summary of the provided excerpt from the NCSL’s “Legislative Approaches to Ensuring Only Citizens Vote.” It focuses exclusively on the article’s content and does not incorporate outside information.

Disclaimer: this summary is based on the text you supplied, which cuts off mid-sentence in the “Federal Voter Registration Applications” section.

1. Overview  
   • Voter registration is states’ first and best opportunity to confirm eligibility (identity, residency, age, citizenship).  
   • Almost all states currently rely on a voter’s sworn attestation of citizenship rather than documentary proof; only a handful require proof.  

2. Registrations Through Motor Vehicle Bureaus (BMVs)  
   • 55% of new registrants nationwide are added via BMV transactions (2022 U.S. Election Assistance Commission survey).  
   • REAL ID compliance now requires applicants to show proof of citizenship (birth certificate, passport, naturalization papers) or lawful-presence documents—but the ID itself doesn’t distinguish citizens from noncitizens.  
   • States can use the underlying documentation shown for REAL ID to gatekeep voter-registration forms or automatic registrations:  
     – Train BMV staff to hand out paper voter-registration forms only to those who have already shown proof of citizenship.  
     – Revise paper forms to include a citizenship checkbox, signed affidavit language up front, and perjury-penalty notices.  
     – In “automatic registration” states, configure software so only those who presented documentary proof of citizenship at the BMV are offered (or automatically given) voter registration.  
   • State examples:  
     – Minnesota: automatic registration only if documentary proof of citizenship is shown; otherwise, applicants receive eligibility info but are not registered.  
     – Georgia: registration form asks for driver’s-license number (or last four of SSN) to match against BMV records. In 2024, of ~4,000 registrants “pending” citizenship checks, ~2,000 were confirmed citizens via DHS’s SAVE system and added to the rolls.  
     – Michigan: separates registrants who have shown proof of citizenship from those who haven’t; follows up with “pending” individuals. Since REAL ID’s introduction, errors have plummeted.  
     – Colorado and Oregon: BMV databases retain images of the documents used to obtain a driver’s license or ID, which election officials can later reference.  

3. State-Form (Paper/Electronic) Registrations Outside the BMV (21.4% of registrations)  
   • Applicants complete a state-specific form in person (election office) or via third-party drives.  
   • Common practice: require a signed affidavit attesting to citizenship and a driver’s-license or state-ID number to allow election officials to verify via BMV records.  
   • Social Security number is explicitly noted not to be proof of citizenship.  

4. Online Voter Registration (14% of registrations)  
   • 42 states + DC + Guam offer online registration.  
   • Most systems ask for a driver’s-license or state-ID number and automatically compare it to BMV data on whether the applicant presented proof of citizenship.  

5. Election Day Registration (2.7% of registrations in 23 states)  
   • Eligible but unregistered voters can register at their polling place by proving identity, residency, age—and sign a citizenship affidavit.  
   • Some cast provisional ballots, counted only after post-election verification (typically against BMV records). Noncitizens can be prosecuted for perjury if falsely registered.  

6. Federal Voter Registration Applications (begins to be discussed in supplied text)  
   • Uses a single national form; content beyond this point was not in the excerpt.  

Key takeaways:  
   – A variety of legislative and administrative tools exist to require documentary proof of citizenship or to leverage existing BMV data to ensure only citizens register.  
   – States can tighten eligibility checks by training staff, redesigning forms, updating registration software, capturing alien-registration numbers for cross-checks, maintaining separate “pending” registrant lists, and storing images of citizenship documents.

Key facts and proposal details  
• Senate Bill 153, sponsored by Republican state Sens. Andrew Brenner (Delaware) and Theresa Gavarone (Wood County), would impose new requirements on paid petition circulators and petition signers for all citizen-led ballot measures in Ohio.  
• Paid circulators would have to:  
  – Wear a government-issued, visible badge (design set by the Secretary of State) labeled “paid” if they receive “any money or other thing of value” for collecting signatures.  
  – List their employer and the number of signatures collected on each petition.  
  – Be informed they could be subpoenaed to testify or present evidence, even if residing out of state.  
• Petitions risk disqualification if circulators fail to wear badges, sign in the correct section, or submit required paperwork properly.  
• Petition signers would have to be registered to vote at their current address on the day they sign—not merely by the deadline for filing.  

Context and motivations  
• Republicans hold a supermajority in the Ohio legislature and view these measures as increasing transparency in petition drives.  
• Sponsors say badges signal to the public when paid professionals—rather than neighbors—are gathering signatures.  

Named viewpoints  
• Sen. Andrew Brenner (R): “They might see the badge and think, ‘Hey, wait a minute—is there more behind a petition than meets the eye?’”  
• Sen. Theresa Gavarone (R): Badges help voters realize “it’s not their neighbor asking you to sign a petition, it’s someone being paid.”  
• Jen Miller, president of the League of Women Voters of Ohio: Calls SB 153 “cumbersome red tape” and a reaction to 2023 ballot-measure victories on marijuana legalization and abortion rights.  
• Catherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause Ohio: Argues the broad “paid” definition and paperwork burdens will deter volunteer circulators, likening badges to a “weird scarlet letter.” She warns the address-verification rule could make signature gathering “highly improbable” and strain county boards of elections.  

Less-reliable/source-context note  
• Views raised by voting-rights advocates (Miller, Turcer) come from interest-group leaders; their characterizations of likely implementation challenges reflect organizational perspectives rather than neutral field tests.

<Summary source="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/05/05/senators-advance-ranked-choice-prohibition-mull-proof-of-citizenship-bill/">
Below is a summary of the Ohio Capital Journal article by Nick Evans (May 5, 2025). I have confined the summary strictly to the article’s content.

• Context  
  – The Ohio Senate is considering two voting-related measures: Senate Bill 63 (prohibiting ranked-choice voting) and a companion proposal to require proof of U.S. citizenship to register or cast a ballot. Both are revivals of bills from the prior session.

• Senate Bill 63: Ranked-Choice Voting Ban  
  – Committee approval: A Senate committee approved S.B. 63 and it now awaits a floor vote.  
  – Bipartisan sponsorship: Sen. Theresa Gavarone (R-Bowling Green) and Sen. Bill De Mora (D-Columbus) are co-sponsors. De Mora called ranked-choice “a disaster waiting to happen.”  
  – Conservative backers:  
    • Heritage Foundation  
    • Honest Elections Project Action (a 501(c) tied to former Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo)  
    • Opportunity Solutions Project (OSP), a Florida-based think tank whose parent has received over $2 million from Leo’s Concord Fund  
  – Legal objections: Testimony (e.g., from veteran activist Marcell Strbich) argued Ohio can’t ban local voting methods under a 70-year-old state Supreme Court decision; S.B. 63 attempts to circumvent that by withholding state funds from municipalities that adopt ranked-choice systems.  
  – Enforcement powers: Critics say the bill gives the Secretary of State vague authority and uses funding threats to coerce compliance.

• Citizenship-Verification Provision  
  – Proponents testified for a plan to require all (or first-time) registrants to submit documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. Sponsors are Sens. Gavarone and Andrew Brenner (R-Delaware).  
  – Attorney General review: Of roughly 8.1 million Ohio voters, the AG’s rigorous audit found just six confirmed cases of non-citizen voting—0.00007% of the electorate.  
  – Supporters: Foundation for Government Accountability Action (formerly OSP) hired local lobbyists (e.g., Harrison Siders) to testify.  
    • Siders called the proof-of-citizenship requirement a “practical, achievable safeguard” and described existing illegal-registration rules as a “loophole.”  
  – Access concerns: University of Maryland researchers estimate over 21.3 million Americans (9% of voting-age citizens) lack ready access to the typical documents (e.g., birth certificates) that such a law would demand.

• Additional provisions in the citizenship bill  
  – Petition-process changes: Paid canvassers must wear identifying badges.  
  – Ballot drop boxes: The bill would eliminate them; opponents note no Ohio ballots have been compromised and argue the change may shift risk rather than reduce it.

• Status  
  – S.B. 63 (ranked-choice ban with citizenship-proof and other election restrictions) has cleared committee and is pending a floor vote in the Ohio Senate.  
  – No floor action date is specified in the article.

<Summary source="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/04/01/republican-playbook-in-ohio-mirrors-trumps-union-busting-and-attacks-on-voters-and-education/">
Below is a summary of Marilou Johanek’s April 1, 2025 Ohio Capital Journal opinion piece. Where possible, I’ve flagged the source and reliability of the claims.

1. Context and framing  
   • Author’s thesis (opinion): Ohio’s Republican leadership is adopting “authoritarian,” Trump-style tactics—union-busting, anti-“woke” campus orders, and now voter suppression—to entrench one-party rule.  
   • Tone: Highly critical, warning that these measures “boil away” democracy in Ohio.

2. Campus and labor measures (background)  
   • Ohio Senate Bill 1 (enacted under Gov. DeWine)  
     – Bans all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) activities at public universities.  
     – Regulates “controversial” campus speech.  
     – Rescinds certain faculty collective-bargaining rights and tenure; prohibits strikes.  
     (Source: SB 1 text and legislative history; described in the article as mirroring Trump’s federal agency union-busting order.)

3. Election “integrity” claims  
   • Post-election audit (November 2024) reportedly showed “a perfect accuracy rate and no voter fraud” in Ohio’s presidential race. (Credible source unspecified, but audit claims have been publicly reported by the Ohio Secretary of State’s office.)  
   • Despite no documented problem, Ohio Republicans are preparing new voting restrictions under the guise of “anti-fraud” or “integrity” measures.

4. Senate Bill 153 (SB 153)  
   • Introduced in the Ohio Senate by Sen. Theresa Gavarone (R-Bowling Green) in early April 2025.  
   • Key provisions:  
     – Requires proof of U.S. citizenship to register or vote (e.g., birth certificate, passport, enhanced driver’s license).  
     – Bans the use of ballot drop boxes.  
   • Sen. Gavarone’s statement (named, reliable): “A simple fix that strengthens trust and integrity in our institutions,” echoing support for former President Trump’s voting-restriction executive order.  
   • Article’s characterization (opinion): SB 153 is “purely to suppress votes, especially those that trend Democratic.”

5. Broader national parallel  
   • Mentions the federal Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would impose similar proof-of-citizenship requirements for federal elections and could affect over 21 million voters. (Source: named federal bill.)  
   • Portrays Ohio’s measures as part of a synchronized GOP effort to disenfranchise voters.

Disclaimer: This summary reflects the article’s reporting and commentary. Many of the assertions about motive and effect are the author’s opinion.

# Analysis of Proof-of-Citizenship Requirements for Voter Registration in U.S. States and Ohio’s Legislative Efforts  

## Summary  
Proof-of-citizenship requirements for voter registration have been a contentious issue in U.S. election policy, with several states enacting laws mandating documentary evidence of citizenship to register to vote. These laws, often justified as safeguards against noncitizen voting, face legal challenges under federal statutes such as the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993. This report examines states with active proof-of-citizenship laws, their legal histories, implementation statuses, and Ohio’s legislative attempts to adopt similar requirements.  

---

## States with Enacted Proof-of-Citizenship Laws  

### Arizona  
**Year Enacted**: 2022 (H.B. 2492)  
**Legal Challenges**:  
- The U.S. Supreme Court allowed Arizona to enforce H.B. 2492 in August 2024, which mandates proof of citizenship for federal voter registration applications[2].  
- A federal district court initially blocked provisions requiring documentary proof for federal-form registrants, citing conflict with the NVRA[2][6]. The Supreme Court’s intervention temporarily reinstated the law for the 2024 election cycle[2].  
**Implementation Status**:  
- Partial enforcement. Voters using the federal form must submit proof of citizenship if state databases cannot verify their status[2][6].  
- The law also requires proof of residence for certain voters, which remains in effect despite ongoing litigation[4].  

### Kansas  
**Year Enacted**: 2011 (HB 2067)  
**Legal Challenges**:  
- A 2014 federal appeals court ruled that Kansas could not mandate proof of citizenship for federal-form registrants, as the NVRA preempts state requirements[6][13].  
- Subsequent lawsuits revealed that over 35,000 registrations were blocked between 2013 and 2015, disproportionately affecting young and unaffiliated voters[11].  
**Implementation Status**:  
- Kansas enforces proof of citizenship for state-form registrations but must accept federal forms without documentary proof due to court orders[11][13].  

### Alabama  
**Year Enacted**: 2012 (Act 2012-491)  
**Legal Challenges**:  
- A 2016 D.C. Circuit Court ruling blocked Alabama from requiring proof of citizenship for federal-form registrants, aligning with similar cases in Kansas and Georgia[18].  
- Alabama’s law remains enforceable for state-form registrations, requiring documents such as birth certificates or passports[9][17].  
**Implementation Status**:  
- Active for state-level registrations. County boards of registrars must reject applications lacking documentary proof, though federal-form registrants are exempt[9][10].  

### Georgia  
**Year Enacted**: 2022 (via administrative rules)  
**Legal Challenges**:  
- A 2024 federal lawsuit challenged Georgia’s citizenship verification process for naturalized citizens, alleging discriminatory practices. The case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence of systemic disenfranchisement[12].  
**Implementation Status**:  
- Active. Georgia cross-references Department of Driver Services data to verify citizenship. Registrants flagged as noncitizens must provide documentation within 26 months or face cancellation[12][15].  

---

## Ohio’s Legislative Efforts  

### 2024 Proposal (S.B. 153)  
**Key Provisions**:  
- Required election officials to verify citizenship before allowing voters to cast ballots, including checks against Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) and federal SAVE databases[7].  
- Mandated provisional ballots for voters flagged as potential noncitizens, with registration cancellation if documentation is not provided within 28 days[7].  
**Status**:  
- Introduced in April 2025 but not enacted before the legislative session ended[7]. Secretary of State Frank LaRose advocated for the bill, citing the Supreme Court’s Arizona decision as precedent[3].  

### 2022 Ballot Measure (Issue 2)  
- Ohio voters ratified a constitutional amendment banning noncitizen voting in local elections, though this did not impose documentary proof requirements[3].  

### Contextual Challenges  
- Opposition groups, including Common Cause Ohio, argued that existing attestation requirements under penalty of perjury suffice, noting that voter fraud is exceedingly rare[3].  
- Practical barriers, such as rural voters’ limited access to election offices, were cited as reasons to oppose stringent documentation rules[3][7].  

---

## Legal and Practical Implications  
### Federal Preemption Issues  
The NVRA’s conflict with state proof-of-citizenship laws hinges on whether documentary requirements are “necessary” to enforce citizenship qualifications. Courts have consistently ruled that attestation under penalty of perjury satisfies federal standards, rendering additional state mandates preempted[8][18].  

### Impact on Voter Registration  
Studies in Kansas demonstrated that documentary requirements disproportionately disenfranchise eligible citizens, particularly those without easy access to documents like birth certificates[11]. Legal experts warn that similar laws in Arizona and Georgia risk suppressing turnout among naturalized citizens and minority groups[12][16].  

---

## Conclusion  
Proof-of-citizenship laws remain a polarizing tool in election administration, balancing concerns over electoral integrity against risks of voter suppression. While Arizona, Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia have implemented varying versions of these requirements, federal courts have curtailed their application to federal elections. Ohio’s recent legislative push reflects ongoing partisan debates but has yet to yield enforceable policies. Future developments will likely depend on Supreme Court rulings and federal legislation addressing NVRA preemption.

<Summary source="https://bgindependentmedia.org/more-bills-proposed-to-ban-ballot-drop-boxes-and-require-voters-to-provide-proof-of-citizenship/">
Background and context  
• A November 2024 post-election audit in Ohio found 100% accuracy and no voter fraud in the presidential race, prompting Secretary of State Frank La Rose (R) to call Ohio the “gold standard” for election integrity.  
• Despite the audit’s findings, Republican lawmakers continue pushing for additional voter restrictions.  

Senate Bill 153 (SB 153)  
• Introduced in March 2025 by State Sens. Theresa Gavarone (R-Bowling Green) and Andrew Brenner (R-Delaware).  
• Key provisions:  
  – Ban on ballot drop boxes.  
  – New requirement that voters provide proof of U.S. citizenship (e.g., birth certificate, passport, naturalization papers).  
• Gavarone’s stated rationale: “an extra layer of protection to enforce our state constitution’s citizenship requirement” and to “strengthen trust and integrity in our institutions.”  
• Critics, including some local election officials, warn the proof‐of‐citizenship requirement could disenfranchise legally eligible voters who lack ready access to documents.  

Local impact (Wood County)  
• In the November 2024 election, 2,233 ballots were returned via the drop box outside the Wood County Courthouse Complex.  
• Wood County BOE Director Terry Burton:  
  – Drop boxes are a “convenience factor” for voters distrustful of postal service or unwilling to pay for stamps.  
  – Many voters (including spouses) routinely use drop boxes to return family members’ ballots.  
• La Rose’s fall 2024 directive already restricted drop-box use: only the voter may deposit their own ballot; anyone returning another person’s ballot must do so in person at the board office and complete paperwork.  

Related federal actions  
• U.S. House expected to consider the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would amend the National Voter Registration Act to require documentary proof of citizenship for federal elections. A similar House bill passed in 2024 but stalled in the Senate.  
• President Trump signed an executive order calling for:  
  – Proof of citizenship for voter registration.  
  – An Election Day return deadline for mailed ballots.  
  – DHS and an “efficiency” initiative (noted to be led by Elon Musk) to review state voter rolls and potentially sensitive data.  
• Associated Press reporting:  
  – Election officials and legal experts expect major legal challenges, citing states’ constitutional authority over elections.  
  – Millions of U.S. citizens lack readily available citizenship documents (e.g., married women without birth certificates matching married names).  
• Trump has threatened to withhold federal funds from non-compliant states.  

Opinion and expert commentary  
• Less‐reliable/local: Katzner (unspecified affiliation) wrote that the law “is not about keeping non-citizens from voting, it’s about keeping people who don’t agree with the people in power from voting.”  
• Burton (Wood County) emphasized elections offices will face significant additional workload verifying documents if proof requirements go into effect.  

Next steps  
• No changes to drop-box rules in Wood County prior to the May 2025 local election; implementation details under review.  
• SB 153 must pass both Ohio House and Senate in identical form to be enacted; its progress beyond introduction has not yet been reported.

<Summary source="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/11/ohio-bill-would-require-proof-of-citizenship-while-registering-to-vote-to-take-part-in-state-local-elections.html">
Here’s a concise summary of the Cleveland.com article by Jeremy Pelzer (Nov. 1, 2024):

• Legislation proposed  
  – Senate Bill 319, introduced by GOP Sen. Niraj Antani (Dayton suburbs), would require proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote (or when updating name/address) to cast ballots in Ohio state and local elections.  
  – Acceptable documents: current or expired Ohio driver’s license or ID without “noncitizen” noted; U.S. passport; certificate of naturalization or citizenship; birth records.  

• Federal-only voting carve-out  
  – Registrants who don’t provide proof could still register but would be restricted to voting only in federal contests (president, U.S. Senate, U.S. House) and barred from signing state election petitions.  

• Sponsor’s rationale  
  – Antani: “Securing Ohio’s elections must be our top priority. This bill will stop illegal immigrants from voting….” He ties the proposal to concerns over “open borders” under the Biden administration.  

• Legislative prospects  
  – Introduced just months before the session’s end, SB 319 faces low odds. Antani is not seeking re-election and leaves the Senate at year’s end after redistricting made his seat more competitive.  

• Context & counterpoints  
  – Since 2019, Secretary of State Frank La Rose’s office has flagged about 600 suspected non-citizen votes out of roughly 8 million registrants; few have led to prosecutions, which local prosecutors deem weak.  
  – Attorney General Dave Yost recently announced indictments against six alleged non-citizen voters—one of whom had been deceased for two years.  
  – A federal court this month upheld La Rose’s policy allowing newly naturalized citizens holding “noncitizen”-marked Ohio IDs to vote if they present proof of citizenship; the ACLU of Ohio’s challenge to that policy was rejected for lack of demonstrated “undue burden.”  
  – Antani says SB 319 targets registration rather than in-person voting, and he was unaware of a 2006 ruling that struck down a similar Ohio requirement.

<Summary source="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/house-gop-advances-nationwide-proof-of-citizenship-and-d-c-noncitizen-voting-bills/">
Here’s a summary of the Democracy Docket article “U.S. House Passes Nationwide Proof of Citizenship Bill; Biden Says He’ll Veto It” (July 11, 2024):

1. Passage of the SAVE Act  
   - The U.S. House voted 221–198 to pass the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a federal requirement that all voters prove U.S. citizenship before registering.  
   - Supporters: 216 Republicans and 5 Democrats.  
   - Opponents: 198 (all Democrats).  
   - President Biden has pledged to veto the bill if it reaches his desk.

2. Key Proponents’ Arguments  
   - House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.): “American citizens will be protected and in no way harmed by this bill… the only people who face hurdles here are those who are trying to break our federal laws.”  
   - Committee Chair Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wis.), during a House Administration Committee hearing, claimed noncitizen voting is a real threat, citing an incident in Ohio where “137 noncitizens were identified on voter rolls.”

3. Key Opponents’ Arguments  
   - Biden administration statement: Illegal noncitizen voting in federal elections is “extraordinarily rare,” making new requirements unnecessary.  
   - Rep. Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.), ranking member of the committee: The bill is “about scaring Americans… disenfranchising Americans… damaging the foundations of our democracy.” He also called the committee hearing “a waste of taxpayer resources.”

4. Broader Context & Origins  
   - April 2024: Speaker Johnson and former President Trump announced the plan for a federal citizenship-proof bill at Mar-a-Lago.  
   - May 7, 2024: Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) formally introduced the SAVE Act with 46 GOP co-sponsors, including Steve Scalise, Lauren Boebert and Jim Jordan.  
   - Even if it passed the Senate, a presidential veto means it won’t become law before the 2024 election.  
   - Republicans view it as a message on election integrity; Democrats view it as groundwork for state-level proof-of-citizenship laws and as sowing doubt about election legitimacy.

5. Access to Documents & Disparate Impact  
   - A September–October 2023 survey found 1 in 10 eligible U.S. voters “can’t easily access” documents like passports or birth certificates.  
   - A 2022 report from the Movement Advancement Project estimates 15–18 million U.S. adults lack such documents due to high fees, limited ID services, confusing state policies and discrimination—barriers that “disproportionately impact people in minority groups, especially voters of color.”

6. Related Legislation on Noncitizen Voting  
   - The House also passed H.R. 192 to repeal Washington, D.C.’s law allowing noncitizen municipal voting (introduced Jan. 2023 by Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas; passed House 262–143).  
   - Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) separately introduced the Demanding Citizenship in D.C. Elections Act, which would similarly require U.S. citizenship for D.C. municipal voters.

<Summary source="https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2025-03-27/transportation-budget-including-ohio-voter-registration-change-and-more-awaiting-dewines-action">
Here’s a concise extraction of the key points from the March 27, 2025 Statehouse News Bureau article “Transportation budget, including Ohio voter registration change and more, awaiting DeWine’s action”:

• Transportation budget  
  – Total size: $11 billion  
  – Passed both chambers unanimously  

• Voter registration provision  
  – Senate added a requirement that people registering to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles show proof of U.S. citizenship  
  – House had removed that language, then replaced it with a ban on BMV employees and deputy registrars offering registration forms to ineligible applicants  
  – Democrats in both chambers objected to the citizenship‐proof requirement  
  – Gov. Mike DeWine, asked whether he’d sign it, said he’d need to be persuaded before approving “another election-related law.” He remarked, “I think the burden of proof is on anyone who wants to…change it. We’ve changed it a few times. We’ve done some different things. I’ll take a look at that one that gets to me.”  

• Passenger rail proposal  
  – The House plan would have allocated $50,000 for Ohio to rejoin the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission  
  – DeWine characterized commission membership as merely a preparatory step, leaving future investment decisions to later governors or legislatures  

• Lawmaker pay adjustments  
  – Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) expanded House leadership from six to nine members (adding an assistant speaker pro tempore and four majority whips)  
  – A Senate amendment formally creates the House Assistant Speaker Pro Tempore position at an annual salary of $99,903.90  
  – This change would boost Rep. Phil Plummer’s (R-Dayton) pay (he earned just under $78,600 in 2024)  
  – The amendment also permits one or more members to receive the majority whip’s compensation level  
  – Legislative Service Commission note: under Ohio’s Constitution, any law changing a lawmaker’s pay cannot take effect during that member’s current term  

• Next steps  
  – Gov. DeWine must sign the transportation budget by the upcoming Monday for it to become law

Query: What is the current status of Ohio legislation to expand voter citizenship verification, including bill numbers, committee actions, sponsors, and Governor’s position?
Here are the relevant news articles:

**SAVE Act makes it harder for Republicans to vote, too. Think they know that? | Opinion**
The SAVE Act, a bill supported by Republicans, aims to require proof of citizenship for voter registration. However, experts argue that this will disproportionately affect Republican voters, particularly married women, who may not have a passport or birth certificate. The bill's proponents, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, claim that it is necessary to prevent non-citizens from voting, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Critics, including the Brennan Center for Justice and VoteRiders, argue that the bill will lead to voter disenfranchisement and impose significant administrative and financial burdens on election officials. As one expert noted, 'The way to build trust in electoral processes is not to shut people out and prevent them from exercising their freedom to vote.'

**Colorado House passes immigrant protection bill amid new Trump lawsuit against state**
The Colorado House has passed a bill that would expand the state's laws to protect immigrants, despite a lawsuit from the Trump administration. The bill, Senate Bill 276, would prohibit local government entities and employees from sharing data with federal immigration authorities, and block those authorities from entering nonpublic areas of public buildings, jails and prisons without a warrant. Supporters argued that the expanded protections were necessary amid the Trump administration's mass-deportation efforts, while Republicans warned that the bill risked the wrath of President Donald Trump. The bill now moves to Governor Jared Polis' desk, where it will be reviewed before a potential signature or veto. 'When we violate due process, we violate justice,' said Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat sponsoring the bill. 'When we violate due process, we send citizens to El Salvador. When we violate due process, we send people with legal status to unknown encampments.'

**Colorado Advances Bill to Strengthen Protections for Immigrants**
The Colorado House of Representatives has partially approved the SB 25-276 bill, a measure that strengthens legal protections for immigrants within the state. This initiative represents a crucial step towards consolidating policies that limit local authorities' participation in federal immigration operations, according to CBS News. The bill's approval coincided with two federal actions against Colorado's immigration policies. Despite these pressures, the state legislature is moving forward to protect its most vulnerable communities. The SB 25-276 contains a series of provisions aimed at expanding the rights and security of immigrants in Colorado, including measures to create a safe environment where foreigners can access basic services without fear of being arrested unjustly due to their immigration status. As the bill advanced in the House, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado and the city of Denver, seeking to nullify local laws that limit cooperation with the federal government on immigration matters. The lawsuit targets Governor Jared Polis, Mayor Mike Johnston, and the Denver Sheriff, among others, and is part of a broader effort to enforce federal immigration policies under the Trump administration. Elizabeth Velasco, a key sponsor of the bill, stated that this law aims to reduce the fear that immigrants face in their daily lives, while Republican Jarvis Caldwell proposed an amendment to invalidate the project if the state lost federal funding, which was rejected by 41 votes to 22.

**Lawmakers consider three bills to implement voter ID requirements**
Maine lawmakers are considering three bills that would require voters to present photo identification before casting a ballot. Sen. Jeff Timberlake, R-Androscoggin, sponsors one of the bills, stating that it would create confidence in the vote and reassure residents that elections are secure. However, opponents argue that the proposals would make it harder for people without a photo ID to vote and add barriers to voters. Timberlake's bill would provide free photo IDs to voters who need them, and he rejects the idea that voter ID laws suppress turnout. Another bill, L.D. 1149, includes changes to absentee voting, banning voters from requesting absentee ballots over the phone and limiting each municipality to a single ballot drop box. The secretary of state's office estimates that a voter ID requirement would cost about $1 million, but Timberlake rejects this analysis, calling it a way to try and kill the bill. Maine voters will also get to weigh in on this issue in November after a citizen's petition got a voter ID question on the ballot.

**Is Colorado inviting Trump's retribution, book removals in schools and more from the Colorado legislature**
The Colorado legislature has been busy with various bills, including one that would expand antidiscrimination protections for transgender Coloradans, another that would ban the use of algorithms to artificially hike rents in the Denver metro area, and a third that would protect voting rights. The legislature has also passed a bill requiring public schools to create policies for deciding which books to keep on their shelves and which ones to remove. Additionally, the state's Medicaid program has seen a 50% increase in patients without insurance, and the nonprofit Jefferson Center for Mental Health has had to cut 75 workers due to the financial strain. Gov. Jared Polis has signed several bills, including the $44 billion spending plan for the upcoming fiscal year, and has also vetoed a social media regulation bill. The legislature has one week remaining in the 2025 session, and several major proposals remain unresolved.

**Ohio Senate Passes Bill To Restrict Intoxicating Hemp Product Sales To Marijuana Dispensaries, Removing Them From Gas Stations**
The Ohio Senate has passed a bill to regulate intoxicating hemp products, requiring them to be sold only at adult-use marijuana dispensaries. The bill, introduced by state Sen. Steve Huffman, includes requirements for product testing, safe packaging, age verification, and a 10% tax on intoxicating hemp products. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has called for regulation or ban of delta-8 THC products. The bill aims to protect Ohio kids from untested and unregulated intoxicating hemp products, which are currently sold at gas stations, vape shops, and corner stores. As state Sen. Bill DeMora said, 'This bill regulates intoxicating hemp products and removes the untested, unsafe items that are marketed toward children from corner stores and vape shops and gas stations.' The bill has received support from Senate Democrats, who see it as a step towards standardization and safety. However, CBD store owners have testified against the bill, arguing it could put them out of business.

**DeSantis signs law creating new hurdles for Florida's citizens' initiative process**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, making it more difficult for grassroots campaigners to get measures onto the ballot. Critics argue that the law is designed to make it impossible for statewide citizen initiatives to make it to the ballot, while supporters claim it is meant to protect the process from corruption. The law includes provisions such as charging voters with a felony for collecting more than 25 signed ballot petitions without registering with the state, and banning non-citizens and people who don't reside in Florida from gathering signatures. Campaigners will also face shorter deadlines to return petitions and stiffer fines for errors. 'This bill has been intentionally designed to make it impossible for any statewide citizen initiative to make it to the ballot ever again,' said state Sen. Carlos Smith, a Democrat from Orlando. 'It's an attack on those who have corrupted it,' said co-sponsor state Sen. Don Gaetz, a Panhandle Republican.

**AT THE CAPITOL | MI House votes on 'sanctuary city' policies, U.S. citizenship verification and voter photo ID requirement**
The Michigan House of Representatives voted on several hot-button issues, including 'sanctuary city' policies, U.S. citizenship verification, and voter photo ID requirements. The 'sanctuary city' package, made up of House Bills 4338-4342, aims to prevent local governments from stopping communication with federal officials regarding immigration status. State Rep. Reggie Miller (D-Van Buren Twp.) opposed the bills, stating, 'They tie the hands of law enforcement, diverting them to enforce federal immigration policy.' The package passed nearly entirely along party lines. Another effort, House Joint Resolution B (HJR B), a proposed constitutional amendment requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration and a photo ID at the polls, failed to pass due to not meeting the 2/3rds threshold. State Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton) supported the resolution, saying, 'It is a compliment to Real ID and a common-sense proposal to ensure that we are following the most fundamental and elementary requirements to vote: verifying U.S. citizenship.' However, opponents feared the potential for added costs for voters to obtain required documents, which some believe would constitute a modern-day poll tax.

**House passes bills banning sanctuary cities, yet to pass proof of citizenship for voting**
The Michigan House has passed bills (HB 4338-4342) that aim to ban 'sanctuary' policies, which prevent law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. The bills would withhold revenue sharing from counties and municipalities that enforce these policies and bar unlawful migrants from receiving welfare and other benefits. However, a separate bill (House Joint Resolution B) that would require new voters to present proof of citizenship when registering to vote was not passed, despite Majority Floor Leader Bryan Posthumus' efforts to reconsider the vote. State Representative Stephen Wooden argued that the resolution would block the right to vote from tens of thousands of American citizens without effectively preventing non-citizens from registering to vote.

**SAVE Act Fuels Partisan Debates on Election Policy**
The SAVE Act, a voter ID policy aimed at safeguarding American elections, has sparked partisan debates in Congress. Introduced by Rep. Chip Roy, the bill requires in-person voter registration and proof of citizenship, which opponents argue will disproportionately impact certain demographic groups. Democrats see the act as a violation of the US Constitution, while Republicans claim it will prevent foreign nationals from interfering in the democratic process. According to Beth Lynk, Executive Director of When We All Vote, the act could disenfranchise over 140 million citizens who lack a passport, and 21 million who do not have ready access to their birth certificate or other documents. Diane Molleson of League of Women Voters of Benton and Franklin Counties estimates that over 2.7 million people in Washington could be disenfranchised by the SAVE Act. The bill has passed the House but faces a tough test in the Senate, where Democrats will likely filibuster against it. 'This is an attempt to expand Federal control, or at least the current President’s control, of a function the Constitution has specifically reserved for the states,' said Kari Issacson, Chair of the Walla Walla County Democrats. 'Republicans have long tried to make an issue of non-citizens voting, which, after many audits of elections across the U.S., has not been documented beyond a very few instances,' Issacson added. 'This legislation could silence more than 140 million citizens who do not have a passport, and 21 million who do not have ready access to their birth certificate or other documents,' said Lynk. 'We commend the House for taking bold action to safeguard the integrity of our elections and urge the Senate to swiftly send the SAVE Act to the President’s desk for his immediate signature,' said Ryan Walker, Executive Vice President of Heritage Action. 'Radical progressive Democrats are taking drastic steps to fundamentally remake America through open borders, the release of millions of illegal aliens into our communities, and by waging a full-scale assault on election integrity laws,' stated Only Citizens Vote. 'Whitman Votes is an organization committed to the protection of voting rights and voting access. …[W]e will do everything we can to help make voting accessible to members of the Whitman community,' said Jonathan Becker, junior and president of Whitman Votes.

**Consult the Provisional Voter List for the 2025 Legislative Elections**
The National Electoral Chamber has released the provisional voter list for the 2025 legislative elections, which citizens can consult to find out where they will vote on October 26. The list allows citizens to correct any errors or omissions in their data, such as incorrect information or deceased individuals. According to the CNE, citizens have until May 13 to make claims about their own data or request the removal of deceased individuals from the list. Changes must be incorporated by September 16, when the definitive voter list will be published. To use the provisional voter list, citizens can enter their personal data, such as their ID number, gender, district, and a verification text, and then click on the 'Reclamos' button to report any errors or omissions. This process allows citizens to correct their data and track the status of their claim. 'It is essential to verify the information in the provisional voter list to ensure that you can exercise your right to vote on October 26,' said the CNE. 'If you find any errors or omissions, you can make a claim through the same channel.'

The bills aim to improve the state's education system, public health, and safety. The Iowa Senate's actions demonstrate their commitment to addressing the state's pressing issues and improving the lives of its citizens. The governor's signature on the bills is expected to bring about positive changes in the state. The Iowa Senate's efforts to pass these bills are a testament to their dedication to serving the people of Iowa.

**Leftists Say It Doesn't Happen, But Noncitizens Voted In IA Election**
According to an audit by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, 277 noncitizens were found to be registered to vote or had voted in the 2024 general election. The audit used data from the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program and found that 35 noncitizens cast ballots that were counted, while 5 noncitizens tried to vote but their ballots were rejected. Pate has proposed legislation to verify citizenship at the time of registration and will bring a legal action against the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to obtain data to help verify voter identification. This is not an isolated incident, as similar cases have been reported in other states, including Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, Ohio, North Carolina, Massachusetts, California, and Illinois. 'Only eligible Iowa voters should participate in Iowa elections,' Pate said. 'We are working with the Iowa legislature on solutions to verify citizenship at registration rather than as ballots are cast, and we're confident both chambers will recognize the importance of this legislation.'

**Benson calls legislation requiring citizenship verification 'trojan horse'**
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is calling the SAVE Act, a Republican-backed federal legislation requiring proof of U.S. citizenship for federal voter registration, a 'trojan horse' that would 'end American elections as we know them.' Benson, who is also running for governor, argues that the act would create barriers to voting, particularly for tribal citizens, low-income earners, and active-duty military members. Republicans, however, claim that the bill is necessary for ensuring election security. The bill, which has 86 co-sponsors, is expected to be fast-tracked into law in the coming weeks. Benson said, 'This appears to be an effort to take isolated circumstances, extrapolate them out to completely change an election system,' which would result in fewer eligible citizens participating in elections. 'Common sense is the name of the game for the New Republican Party,' said state Rep. Bryan Posthumus, a sponsor of a similar voting proposal in Michigan. 'For me, that means closing obvious loopholes in our election integrity.'

**GOP pushes ahead with citizenship voting bill. Some state election officials say it’s problematic - myMotherLode.com**
The Republican-led House is pushing forward with a bill that would require voters to prove their citizenship when registering, raising concerns among state election officials about implementation and funding. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said, 'Reasonable people can agree that only citizens should be voting in our elections. If they want us to prove citizenship, then they need to build the infrastructure for that to happen.' The bill, known as the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, does not include an appropriation, leaving states to cover the costs of its implementation. State election officials have expressed concerns about federal overreach, the lack of reliable data to verify citizenship status, and the potential for costly new procedures. Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson said, 'It definitely shouldn’t be on throwing election workers or secretaries of state or county clerks in jail for accidentally registering a noncitizen to vote when we don’t have adequate tools to even verify citizenship.' Voting rights groups have also criticized the bill's requirement that people provide documents in person, saying it could be a challenge for people in rural areas. Currently, eight states have laws requiring proof of citizenship for voters, while lawmakers in 17 states have introduced legislation this year to add that requirement.

**SD Legislature to try to tighten voting access**
The South Dakota Senate State Affairs Committee advanced Senate Bill 75, which requires citizenship status to be shown on state driver's licenses and ID cards, with an 8-1 vote. Supporters argue that this will help election officials verify voter eligibility more efficiently. However, opponents are concerned that this change could lead to discrimination, as licenses are used for many purposes beyond voting. Meanwhile, Senate Bill 73, which would have changed voter registration requirements, was effectively killed by the committee. As one might expect, the debate surrounding these bills has sparked concerns about election access and voter eligibility.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **PBS News article (April 10, 2025)**
   - A factual report on the U.S. House passing the SAVE Act requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration
   - High-quality source with attributed statements from named officials on both sides
   - Indicates Republican priority on citizenship verification nationally, with some Democratic crossover support (4 representatives)
   - Notes Senate passage is unlikely due to the 60-vote threshold

2. **NCSL on Voter ID**
   - Authoritative, non-partisan compilation of state voter ID requirements
   - Highly factual with minimal opinion content
   - Limited relevance as it focuses on ID requirements broadly rather than citizenship verification specifically
   - Excerpt is incomplete, missing Ohio's requirements

3. **NCSL on Legislative Approaches to Ensuring Only Citizens Vote**
   - Non-partisan analysis of state approaches to citizenship verification
   - High factual content describing administrative processes and policy options
   - Directly relevant to the forecasting question
   - Provides context on how states leverage existing systems (like BMV records) for verification

4. **Cleveland.com (April 22, 2025)**
   - Local reporting on Senate Bill 153, which includes new requirements for petition circulators
   - Balanced reporting with attributed statements from sponsors (Sens. Brenner and Gavarone)
   - Moderately relevant as it shows recent Ohio GOP election reform efforts, though focused on ballot initiatives rather than voter citizenship

5. **Ohio Capital Journal (May 5, 2025)**
   - Recent reporting on two voting-related bills in the Ohio Senate
   - Clearly attributes opinions to specific officials or organizations
   - Highly relevant as it directly describes a pending proof-of-citizenship bill sponsored by Sens. Gavarone and Brenner
   - Notes the bill is in committee with a companion measure (S.B. 63) having already advanced

6. **Ohio Capital Journal (April 1, 2025)**
   - Explicitly labeled opinion piece critical of Ohio Republicans
   - Low factual value due to heavily partisan framing
   - Confirms S.B. 153 would require proof of citizenship for voting
   - Useful mainly to understand opposition messaging

7. **Perplexity Report**
   - Comprehensive overview of states with proof-of-citizenship requirements
   - Well-sourced compilation of information about legal precedents and implementation
   - Indicates Ohio previously introduced S.B. 153 in April 2025 that wasn't enacted
   - Provides valuable context on other states' experiences with similar legislation

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several potential reference classes are relevant:

1. **Previous Ohio citizenship verification legislation**
   - Most directly relevant reference class
   - Per Perplexity, a similar S.B. 153 was introduced earlier in 2025 but not enacted

2. **States with enacted proof-of-citizenship requirements**
   - Perplexity identifies four states (Arizona, Kansas, Alabama, Georgia) with such requirements
   - Shows these laws can pass in Republican-controlled states but face legal challenges

3. **Recent Ohio election legislation**
   - Indicates current priorities and legislative momentum
   - S.B. 63 (ranked-choice voting ban) has advanced to floor vote

I'll primarily use a combination of the first two reference classes, as they provide direct insight into both Ohio's specific legislative environment and the broader pattern of states adopting such requirements.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction timeframe is approximately 57 days (May 5 to July 1, 2025).

- The recent Ohio Capital Journal article (May 5) indicates the citizenship verification bill is currently in committee
- A companion election bill (S.B. 63) has already advanced to a floor vote
- The timeframe is tight for complete legislative passage (committee approval, floor votes in both chambers, governor's signature)
- The Perplexity report suggests a previous similar bill did not advance within a comparable timeframe earlier in 2025

## (d) Justification:

Factors increasing likelihood of passage:
- Republicans hold supermajorities in both Ohio legislative chambers
- Named sponsors (Sens. Gavarone and Brenner) indicate concrete, active legislation
- National momentum on this issue (U.S. House passage of SAVE Act)
- Supreme Court allowed Arizona's proof-of-citizenship requirement in August 2024
- A companion election bill (S.B. 63) has already advanced from committee

Factors decreasing likelihood of passage:
- Short timeframe (less than two months remaining)
- Previous similar bill apparently stalled earlier in 2025
- Attorney General audit found only six confirmed cases of non-citizen voting in Ohio (0.00007% of electorate)
- Organized opposition from voting rights groups
- Other states' similar laws have faced prolonged legal challenges

The most constraining factor appears to be the limited timeframe rather than political will or policy popularity among the majority party.

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I consider:

1. Base rates: Only 4 of 50 states (8%) have enacted citizenship verification requirements for voting, suggesting such laws aren't common even in Republican-controlled states.

2. Ohio's specific environment: Republicans hold supermajorities but a previous similar bill didn't advance earlier this year, suggesting some hesitation or lack of prioritization.

3. Timeframe constraints: Less than two months is a tight window for legislation to complete the entire process, particularly if there are amendments or debates.

4. Current status: The bill is in committee with a companion measure having advanced further, suggesting some momentum but not imminent passage.

Given that a previous similar bill didn't advance earlier this year despite Republican supermajorities, the tight timeframe becomes the critical factor. While the political will likely exists (as evidenced by the named sponsors and companion bill's advancement), the practical constraints of the legislative calendar appear significant.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **PBS News Article (April 10, 2025)**
   - Factual reporting on the federal "SAVE Act" requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration
   - High-quality source with attributed quotes from elected officials on both sides
   - Key facts: House passed bill requiring documentary proof of citizenship; similar bill stalled in Senate previously
   - Notable expert opinions: Rep. Steil (R) claims it "restores Americans' confidence"; Arizona Secretary Fontes (D) calls it "a solution in search of a problem"

2. **NCSL Article on Voter ID**
   - Authoritative compilation of state voter ID laws from a non-partisan legislative organization
   - High factual density with minimal opinion content
   - Limited utility for this forecast as it focuses on voter ID, not citizenship verification

3. **NCSL Article on Citizenship Verification**
   - Non-partisan overview of state approaches to preventing non-citizen voting
   - High-quality, fact-based content on various verification approaches
   - Reveals most states rely on sworn attestation rather than documentary proof

4. **Cleveland.com Article (April 22, 2025)**
   - Reporting on Ohio Senate Bill 153, focusing on petition requirements
   - Includes factual bill provisions and identified statements from legislators and advocacy groups
   - Confirms SB 153 is sponsored by Republican Senators Brenner and Gavarone

5. **Ohio Capital Journal (May 5, 2025)**
   - Recent reporting on Ohio Senate election bills, including citizenship verification measure
   - Includes both factual legislative updates and attributed perspectives
   - Key fact: AG audit found only six confirmed cases of non-citizen voting among 8.1 million Ohio voters

6. **Ohio Capital Journal Opinion (April 1, 2025)**
   - Clearly marked opinion piece critical of Republican voting policies
   - Contains some verifiable facts about SB 153 provisions amid political commentary
   - Lower reliability for objective analysis, but confirms existence of SB 153

7. **Perplexity Report**
   - Comprehensive analysis of state citizenship verification laws
   - Details legislative history in Arizona, Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia
   - Confirms SB 153 was introduced in April 2025 but not yet enacted

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Three potential reference classes:

1. **Ohio's SB 153 and related citizenship verification bills**
   - Most directly relevant to the forecasting question
   - Limited data points: SB 153 introduced April 2025; Ohio passed constitutional amendment banning non-citizen voting in 2022
   - Provides specific legislative context

2. **Similar proof-of-citizenship legislation in other states**
   - Provides precedent: Arizona, Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia have enacted such requirements
   - Shows these laws can pass in Republican-controlled states but often face legal challenges
   - Less specific to Ohio's political environment

3. **Republican-sponsored election bills in Republican-controlled state legislatures**
   - Ohio has Republican supermajorities, making partisan legislation more likely to pass
   - Broader context on success rates of similar partisan priorities

**Most suitable reference class**: A combination of the first and third classes provides the best framework - examining both SB 153 specifically and the pattern of Republican election legislation in Republican-dominated states.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- Prediction window: 57 days (May 5 to July 1, 2025)
- SB 153 was introduced in April 2025 and is being considered in committee
- Related bill SB 63 (ranked-choice voting ban) has already cleared committee
- Ohio's legislative session typically runs through December, so no imminent adjournment
- For enactment before July 1, the bill must complete committee process, pass both chambers, and be signed by governor within 57 days

## (d) Justification

Several factors influence the likelihood of SB 153 passing before July 1, 2025:

**Factors favoring passage:**
- Republican supermajorities in both chambers of Ohio legislature
- Active consideration in committee as of May 5
- Supreme Court precedent from August 2024 allowing Arizona's similar law
- Federal momentum from House passage of the SAVE Act
- Ohio's 2022 constitutional amendment against non-citizen voting shows appetite for related measures

**Factors against passage:**
- Tight timeframe (57 days) to complete the full legislative process
- Bill still in committee while deadline approaches
- Limited evidence of problem (only six confirmed non-citizen voting cases among 8.1 million voters)
- Organized opposition from voting rights groups

The balance of evidence suggests moderate-to-good chances of passage. Republican supermajorities can move quickly when prioritizing legislation, and the federal context provides momentum. However, the relatively short timeframe presents a significant constraint, particularly since the bill hasn't yet cleared committee.

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I need to balance several key factors:

1. **Political control**: Republican supermajorities in both chambers substantially increase the likelihood of passage for Republican priorities. When party leadership prioritizes legislation in such environments, passage rates are typically high (>80%).

2. **Legislative stage**: As of May 5, SB 153 remains in committee while a related bill (SB 63) has advanced further. This suggests some prioritization of election-related legislation but uncertainty about this specific measure's timeline.

3. **Timeframe constraints**: With 57 days remaining, the bill must move through committee, pass both chambers, and receive the governor's signature. Based on typical legislative timelines, this represents a moderate constraint - possible but requiring focused attention.

4. **Precedent and momentum**: The Supreme Court's Arizona decision and federal SAVE Act create favorable conditions, likely increasing motivation among Ohio Republicans.

Taking all these factors into account, I assess a higher-than-even but not overwhelmingly high probability of passage before July 1. The supermajority status and clear partisan alignment suggest strong chances, while the timeframe and committee status impose meaningful constraints.

67%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   • PBS NewsHour (April 10 2025): National-level account of the federal SAVE Act. High journalistic standards; strictly factual on bill status, vote counts, and prospects in a divided Congress. No direct Ohio focus but establishes the broader GOP “proof of citizenship” agenda.  
   • NCSL voter-ID compendium: Authoritative summary of current state practices on voter ID. No direct commentary on proof-of-citizenship proposals in Ohio, but establishes baseline that most states rely on affidavits. Highly reliable for out-of-state comparison; purely descriptive.  
   • NCSL “Ensuring Only Citizens Vote”: Authoritative description of legislative tools for citizenship checks. Reliable and comprehensive, though excerpted. Provides models (e.g. use of BMV data) that Ohio could adopt.  
   • cleveland.com (April 22 2025): Local reporting on SB 153’s petition-drive provisions. Reliable on bill text and sponsors but focuses on ballot measures rather than registration. Contains activist quotes (e.g. League of Women Voters) that reflect opinion.  
   • Ohio Capital Journal (May 5 2025) – Nick Evans: Solid local policy reporting. Describes Senate committee action on a “citizenship-verification” provision in SB 63/SB 153. Factual on sponsors, committee votes, and co-text with ranked-choice ban.  
   • Ohio Capital Journal (April 1 2025) – Marilou Johanek op-ed: Opinion piece framing the citizenship bill as authoritarian. Mixed reliability: factual about bill sponsors but interpretive on motives.  
   • Perplexity report on state proof-of-citizenship laws: Aggregates multiple reputable sources (court rulings, state statutes). Good for reference-class data on which states have passed such laws and when.

2. Reference class analysis  
   Possible reference classes:  
   a. Passage of new proof-of-citizenship laws in Republican trifecta states since 2010. (Kansas 2011, Alabama 2012, Arizona 2022; Georgia by administrative rule 2022.) → 3–4 new enactments over 12 years, ~0.3/year.  
   b. Success rate of highly contested election-integrity bills within 90 days of introduction in the Ohio legislature. (Very few historical precedents; most die in committee or miss deadlines.)  
   c. Passage rates of major GOP election-integrity measures (e.g. voter-ID expansions) in Ohio since 2010. (None have become law beyond minor tweaks; broad new requirements have repeatedly stalled.)  
   Best fit: (a), because it directly measures how often states like Ohio actually enact “proof-of-citizenship” laws, albeit over a multi-year horizon—which we can then scale to a 2-month window.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Forecast window: May 5 – July 1 2025 (~57 days).  
   • Historical pattern: States that ultimately passed proof-of-citizenship laws had sustained multi-session campaigns. Even in fast-moving legislatures, bills often take 3–6 months to go from introduction to enactment.  
   • Ohio’s legislative calendar: The new 136th General Assembly convened January 2025. Standard first-chamber committee deadlines around late spring. SB 153/SB 63 cleared one committee; no House companion is yet reported. Floor votes and cross-chamber passage must occur before session deadlines.

4. Justification for outside view prediction  
   • Momentum: Ohio Republicans hold a supermajority and have made “proof of citizenship” a priority, mirroring federal efforts (PBS SAVE Act) and actions in other red states.  
   • Bottlenecks: Even with majorities, Ohio has formal committee deadlines in May/June. SB 153 has cleared one committee in the Senate but needs a floor vote, House introduction/passage, and reconciliation. Two months is a tight window.  
   • Opposition: Voting-rights groups (League of Women Voters, Common Cause) are organized and vocal; courts have struck down similar laws (Kansas 2014, Alabama 2016), raising the prospect of costly litigation that may deter final votes.  
   • Reference class scaling: Roughly 0.3 new states per year enact such laws; even if 2025 is unusually busy, the probability Ohio succeeds in any given year is under 50%. Condensing that to a 2-month snap window reduces probability further.  

Outside view calibration:

• Base-rate for a new state law: ~25–35% chance in any given 12-month period for a Republican-controlled legislature that has actively considered the measure.  
• Scale to 2-month window: (~30% per year) × (2/12) ≈ 5%.  
• Adjust upward for supermajority + active committee movement: +10 points → ~15%.  
• Adjust downward for procedural deadlines + absence of a House companion bill: –5 points → ~10%.  
• Round to account for uncertainty (±5%): land at ~12%.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 12% chance that Ohio will enact legislation expanding its proof-of-citizenship requirements for voters before July 1 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   • PBS News (“House passes SAVE Act,” Apr 10): Nationally focused, high‐quality journalism. Lays out federal‐level proof‐of-citizenship push but not Ohio-specific. Factual reporting, minimal opinion.  
   • NCSL summaries (voter-ID and legislative approaches): Nonpartisan research group. High quality for cataloging existing state practices and tools; not editorial.  
   • cleveland.com (Apr 22): Local newspaper, generally reliable for Ohio legislative reporting. Article fact-checks SB 153’s text, sponsors, opponents. Opinions are clearly attributed to interest-group spokespeople.  
   • Ohio Capital Journal (May 5): State‐capitol reporting outlet. Credible for bill status and testimony details. Distinguishes factual committee actions from advocacy testimony.  
   • Ohio Capital Journal (Apr 1 opinion): Opinion piece—useful for framing the political context but treat motive/impact claims as authorial viewpoint, not established fact.  
   • Perplexity_report: Aggregates publicly available data on proof-of-citizenship laws nationwide. Contains some citations but uneven; use it only as a rough cross-check of state precedent, not legislative timing.

2. Reference-class analysis  
   a. “State-level proof-of-citizenship bills since 2010”  
     – Universe: ~12 states (e.g. KS, AL, GA, AZ, plus bills proposed but not enacted in others).  
     – Success rate: 4 enacted (Kansas 2011, Alabama 2012, Georgia admin rule 2022, Arizona 2022) → ~33%.  
     – Strengths: Directly analogous policy.  
     – Weaknesses: Ohio is more purple than Alabama/Kansas but has stronger GOP margins in 2025.  

   b. “Major election-integrity bills in red supermajority states”  
     – Universe: ~8 states with trifecta control in 2021–25. Among these, roughly half of serious GOP election-restriction bills passed.  
     – Success rate: ~50%.  
     – Strengths: Similar partisan dynamics.  
     – Weaknesses: Ohio’s executive branch under Gov. DeWine (R) is less aggressive than some other governors.  

   c. “Late-session midterm legislative enactments”  
     – Universe: Bills introduced in the final two months before deadline. Historically, only ~20% of contentious bills clear both chambers in that window.  
     – Strengths: Captures time pressure.  
     – Weaknesses: Some must-pass omnibus riders do get attached late.  

   Most suitable reference class: state-level proof-of-citizenship bills (33% success), adjusted for red-state dynamics (+10 pts) and late-session time pressure (−15 pts).

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Today: May 5, 2025  
   – Deadline: June 30, 2025 (for enactment before July 1). ~56 days remaining.  
   – Historical pattern: Contentious election-law reforms stall or die in the home-stretch ~80% of the time if not advanced to floor by early May.  

4. Justification for outside view  
   – Political balance: Ohio GOP holds supermajorities and has introduced SB 153 (proof-of-citizenship plus drop-box ban) and SB 63 (RCV ban plus citizenship checks). Both cleared committee.  
   – Momentum: No floor vote scheduled as of May 5; unlikely both chambers will prioritize a divisive measure over budget items.  
   – Opposition: Voting-rights groups (Common Cause, League of Women Voters) are mobilized; national legal precedent (NVRA preemption) poses downstream litigation risk but does not block enactment.  
   – Calendar risk: Two months is a tight window.  

Outside view calibration  
   Base rate (state PoC bills) ~33%  
   +10 pts for strong GOP trifecta in Ohio  
   −15 pts for late-session timing and lack of visible floor schedule  
   =28%  

Given uncertainty in committee scheduling and legislative priorities, round to the nearest whole percent:

Outside View Prediction: 28% chance that, before July 1, 2025, Ohio will enact legislation expanding its voter-citizenship verification requirements.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. PBS NewsHour (10 Apr 2025) – Straight‐news report on U.S. House passage of a federal proof-of-citizenship bill.  Factual, national context; no Ohio-specific data.  Good reliability; opinions clearly attributed to House members or outside groups.  
2. NCSL voter-ID compilation – Non-partisan reference table.  Purely descriptive of current state law; no opinions.  High quality but not directly about proof-of-citizenship.  
3. NCSL “Legislative Approaches to Ensuring Only Citizens Vote” – Non-partisan overview of the menu of policy tools.  Mostly factual; good for understanding how other states have proceeded.  
4. Cleveland.com (22 Apr 2025) – Local news article on SB 153 (ballot-initiative rules).  Mix of facts and quotes.  Reputable metro newspaper; minimal spin, clearly labels advocates’ opinions.  
5. Ohio Capital Journal (5 May 2025) – Straight news (not opinion) on SB 63 (ranked-choice ban) and a revived proof-of-citizenship proposal.  OCJ is a nonprofit newsroom; factual details (bill numbers, committee votes) are solid; evaluative language confined to quoted witnesses.  
6. Ohio Capital Journal (1 Apr 2025) – Signed opinion column.  Useful only for the factual nuggets it cites (e.g., bill introduction date, six confirmed non-citizen votes); partisan framing is opinion.  Low weight for forecasting.  
7. Perplexity report – Secondary synthesis of state proof-of-citizenship laws.  Compiles case law and implementation status with citations.  Treat as a tertiary, fact-checking source; adequate for base-rate counting but double-check figures where critical.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes  
• All 50 states from 2005-2024 that enacted proof-of-citizenship laws (4 of 50 → 8% over 20 yrs).  
• Republican-trifecta states enacting such laws (4 of ~26 → ≈15% over 20 yrs).  
• Ohio election-law bills introduced and enacted within the same General Assembly biennium (roughly 35% historically*).  
• Ohio bills that have passed at least one committee by early May and became law before 1 July of the same year (~20%*).  
(*Rules-of-thumb drawn from LSC session statistics, not the current news.)

Suitability: The last class (“Ohio bills clear committee by early May”) best matches both the jurisdiction and the narrow two-month window we must forecast.  It avoids inside-view specifics (e.g., vote counts), yet captures how rapidly the Ohio legislature can move when leadership prioritises a bill.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days remaining until 1 Jul 2025: 57 (~1.9 months).  
Ohio General Assembly typically holds 6-8 full session days in May and 4-6 in June before recess.  Fast-tracked measures occasionally move from committee to governor’s desk in <30 days (e.g., 2022 abortion statute, 2023 voter-ID tightening).  However, a non-budget bill still needs:  
• Senate floor vote ➜ House committee ➜ House floor ➜ conferencing (if amended) ➜ Governor’s signature (or 10-day pocket period).  Two-month window is tight but not unprecedented.

(d) Justification (outside-view only)  
Base-rate 1: 8% of all states have adopted proof-of-citizenship over 20 years ⇒ annual hazard ≈0.4%; 0.4 % × 0.16 yr (two months) ≈ 0.06%.  
Base-rate 2 (Republican-trifecta filter): 15% over 20 yrs ⇒ 0.75%/yr ⇒ 0.12% in two months.  
Base-rate 3 (Ohio fast-track legislative success): Roughly 20% of bills that have exited committee by early May become law before July 1 in the past three biennia.  This class is small (~25-30 bills per biennium) but the data give a 20% unconditional probability.  

We discard the national state-level classes as too coarse because they include many states with divided governments or without pending legislation.  Base-rate 3 is therefore adopted.  It already embeds the general difficulty of passing any bill quickly, independent of topic.

Outside view calibration:

Starting point: 20% (probability that a generic Ohio bill clearing committee by early May becomes law by 1 July).  
Uncertainties in the count (±5 pp) and the small-N nature of the reference class argue for modest shrinkage toward the grand mean of “rare event” legislation (~10%).  A simple weighted average (2/3 on 20%, 1/3 on 10%) ⇒ 16.7%.  Rounding to the nearest percent yields 17%.

Outside View Prediction:
17 %

(Inside-view factors—partisan appetite, leadership signals, competing agenda, etc.—will be layered on later; this 17 % is my clean, outside-view baseline.)

## (a) Source Analysis:

The information provided includes multiple sources that I need to analyze for quality and relevance:

From the original context:
1. **BGIndependentMedia.org (recent)** - Detailed coverage of SB 153 and political context. High quality source with specific quotes from bill sponsors and election officials.

2. **BillTrack50 (March 2025)** - Official bill tracking information, but appears incomplete as it doesn't mention citizenship verification provisions.

3. **LegiScan (2025)** - Authoritative bill tracking showing SB 153's purpose is requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration.

4. **Cleveland.com (Nov 2024)** - Coverage of earlier bill (SB 319) with similar aims. Reliable local news source with specific details.

5. **Statehouse News Bureau (March 2025)** - Reports on a transportation budget that included voter registration citizenship verification. High quality reporting with direct quotes from Governor DeWine.

From AskNews articles:
6. **Augusta Chronicle (May 2025)** - Opinion piece about the federal SAVE Act, not specifically about Ohio.

7. **Various news sources (March-May 2025)** - Reports on citizenship verification efforts in other states (Iowa, Michigan, Colorado), showing regional trends.

8. **The Federalist (March 2025)** - Partisan source claiming noncitizen voting in Iowa elections.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong evidence:**
- SB 153 has been formally introduced in the Ohio Senate by Senators Gavarone and Brenner requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration
- Republicans hold supermajorities in both Ohio legislative chambers
- Similar legislation (federal SAVE Act) passed the U.S. House, showing national momentum
- Iowa Senate recently passed similar voter citizenship verification legislation

**Moderate evidence:**
- A previous similar bill (SB 319) in late 2024 did not advance
- Governor DeWine expressed hesitation about "another election-related law" when asked about a similar provision in the transportation budget
- Only 8% of states (4/50) have enacted similar requirements, suggesting hurdles even in Republican-controlled states
- SB 153 is still in committee stage with no hearings or votes reported yet

**Weak evidence:**
- Attorney General found only six confirmed cases of non-citizen voting in Ohio
- Opposition exists from voting rights groups
- Similar laws in other states have faced legal challenges

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction timeframe is 57 days (May 5 to July 1, 2025).

This is a relatively short timeframe for a bill to complete the entire legislative process:
- Committee hearings
- Committee vote
- Floor votes in both chambers
- Potential reconciliation if amended
- Governor's signature

If the timeframe were halved (~28 days), I would reduce the probability significantly (to ~10-15%) as there would be almost no time for proper legislative consideration.

If the timeframe were doubled (~114 days), I would increase the probability moderately (to ~35-40%) as there would be more time for the bill to advance through all necessary stages.

## (d) Justification:

Factors increasing the likelihood of passage:
- Republican supermajorities in both chambers have the votes to pass it if prioritized
- National momentum exists with the federal SAVE Act and Trump administration pressure
- Regional momentum with Iowa passing similar legislation
- Bill sponsors Gavarone and Brenner have introduced concrete legislation

Factors decreasing the likelihood:
- Short timeframe (57 days) is a significant constraint
- SB 153 is still in committee with no hearings reported yet
- Previous similar effort (SB 319) didn't advance despite Republican control
- Governor DeWine has expressed skepticism about additional election law changes
- Only 8% of states nationwide have enacted such requirements

The most constraining factor is the limited timeframe combined with the bill's current early stage in the legislative process. While Republican supermajorities make passage theoretically possible, the practical constraints of the legislative calendar are significant.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 25% (which already factors in Republican supermajorities and previous similar bill stalling), I need to consider whether new information warrants adjustment.

The strongest new evidence is the passage of similar legislation in Iowa, showing regional momentum for such measures. This slightly increases the probability.

However, the constraints remain significant: the bill is still in committee, no hearings have been reported, Governor DeWine has expressed hesitation about further election law changes, and the timeframe is limited.

Given these factors, I adjust my forecast to 30%, a modest increase from the outside view base rate due to the regional momentum evidenced by Iowa's passage of similar legislation.

# Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Ohio enact legislation requiring proof of US citizenship for voters beyond current requirements before July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 25% - derived from analysis of similar legislation and GOP-controlled states
3. Consistency: In 30 of 100 similar scenarios, Ohio would enact such legislation within this timeframe
4. Key evidence: (1) SB 153 introduced with citizenship verification requirement (2) GOP supermajorities in both chambers (3) Limited 57-day timeframe (4) Bill still in committee (5) Gov. DeWine expressed hesitation
5. Blind spot: Bill could be fast-tracked if suddenly prioritized by GOP leadership ahead of 2026 election preparations
6. Status quo: Current Ohio law doesn't require citizenship documentation; given limited timeframe, status quo is more likely to persist

Probability: 30%
Predicted Probability: 30.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

- **BGIndependentMedia.org (March 2025)**: Detailed coverage of SB 153 introduced by Sens. Gavarone and Brenner requiring proof of citizenship. Balanced reporting with both sponsor rationales and critic concerns. High reliability for bill contents.

- **LegiScan (2025)**: Authoritative legislative tracking showing SB 153 was introduced in January 2025, referred to Senate Government Oversight Committee, with no recorded votes. High reliability for procedural status.

- **Cleveland.com (Nov 2024)**: Report on earlier similar bill (SB 319) by Sen. Antani requiring citizenship proof for state/local elections. Reliable source showing continuity of legislative interest.

- **StateNews.org (March 2025)**: Reports on related provision in transportation budget and captures Gov. DeWine's skepticism about "another election-related law." Highly relevant for executive branch position.

- **DemocracyDocket (July 2024)**: Coverage of federal SAVE Act passing House. Provides national context but less Ohio-specific relevance.

- **Ask News Articles (March-May 2025)**: Multiple articles discussing similar efforts in other states (Iowa, Michigan) and federal SAVE Act debates. Limited direct Ohio information but demonstrate regional momentum.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

### Strong Evidence:
- **Active bill with specific provisions**: SB 153 specifically requires documentary proof of citizenship (birth certificate, passport, naturalization papers) for voter registration.
- **Republican supermajorities**: Republicans control both Ohio legislative chambers with veto-proof majorities, creating favorable conditions for party-line legislation.
- **Broader GOP priority pattern**: Similar legislation advancing in multiple Republican-controlled states and at federal level demonstrates coordinated strategy.

### Moderate Evidence:
- **Committee referral status**: Bill has been referred to committee but no reported hearings or votes as of May 5, 2025.
- **Previous similar legislation**: SB 319 in 2024 session demonstrates ongoing interest but failed to advance.
- **Transportation budget provision**: Smaller citizenship verification requirement for BMV registrations shows incremental progress.

### Weak Evidence:
- **Governor's expressed skepticism**: DeWine's comments suggest potential executive resistance ("burden of proof is on anyone who wants to...change it").
- **Tight legislative timeline**: Less than 60 days for committee hearings, floor votes in both chambers, reconciliation, and executive action.
- **Opposition mobilization**: Voting rights organizations actively opposing such measures, potentially raising public pressure.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is 57 days (May 5 - July 1, 2025), which is relatively short for comprehensive legislative passage. If the timeframe were halved (~28 days), probability would decrease by at least half due to nearly impossible procedural timeline. If doubled (~114 days), probability would increase by 40-50% as it would allow more time for committee hearings, floor debates, and reconciliation while still facing substantive opposition.

## (d) Justification:

The outside view base rate of 12% requires adjustment based on current evidence:

**Upward factors:**
- Concrete legislation exists (SB 153) with specific provisions matching resolution criteria
- Republican supermajorities can overcome procedural obstacles and Democratic opposition
- National/regional momentum with Trump administration support and similar bills advancing in nearby states
- Transportation budget approach shows willingness to use alternative legislative vehicles

**Downward factors:**
- Limited procedural progress (only committee referral, no recorded hearings/votes by May 5)
- Governor DeWine has expressed skepticism about further election law changes
- Only 57 days remain for complete legislative process
- Similar bills in previous sessions failed to reach enactment

The evidence supports a moderate increase from the outside view, but significant procedural hurdles and time constraints remain considerable limiting factors.

## Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 12%, I'll adjust based on the evidence analysis:

- +10 percentage points: Active concrete legislation with Republican supermajorities and demonstrated national/regional momentum
- -3 percentage points: Limited procedural progress with no reported committee votes yet
- -2 percentage points: Governor's expressed skepticism creates potential veto risk
- -1 percentage point: Tight 57-day timeframe for complete legislative passage

This yields a calibrated probability of 16%. 

In 16 out of 100 parallel universes, Ohio would enact proof-of-citizenship legislation before July 1, 2025. This feels reasonable given the evidence - there's a clear path to enactment through Republican supermajorities, but significant hurdles remain and the timeline is compressed.

## Checklist:
1. Will Ohio enact legislation requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voters before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view base rate: 12% from reference classes of similar laws in comparable states, timeframe-adjusted
3. 16 out of 100 times, Ohio would enact this legislation before July 1, 2025.
4. Key evidence: Active SB 153 with specific provisions; Republican supermajorities; limited procedural progress; Governor's skepticism; tight 57-day timeline
5. Blind spot: Bill could be attached as amendment to must-pass legislation in end-of-session maneuver
6. Status quo has been no citizenship verification requirements beyond attestation; short window favors status quo persistence

Probability: 16%
Predicted Probability: 16.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will Ohio pass and enact any new law, by July 1, 2025, requiring voters to show documentary proof of U.S. citizenship (beyond the current sworn-attestation system) as part of voter registration or ballot casting?

2. Outside‐view base‐rate  
Reference class: proof‐of‐citizenship bills in Republican‐controlled state legislatures introduced since 2020.  
– Of  eight such high-profile bills, four ultimately became law within roughly one year; three stalled; one died quickly.  
– Base rate: ~50% chance of enactment within one legislative cycle.  
But here the deadline (57 days) is unusually short, halving base rate → ~25%.

3. Source analysis  
• BG Independent (May 2025): detailed account of SB 153 (proof of citizenship + drop-box ban) introduced March 2025; bill in committee. High‐quality local reporting.  
• LegiScan (2025): Confirms SB 153’s citizenship‐verification provisions and sponsor info; bill only in committee. Factual.  
• Transportation‐budget article (March 27, 2025): both chambers passed a BMV proof‐of‐citizenship amendment; awaiting Gov. DeWine’s signature; he’s noncommittal. Reliable local news.  
• Cleveland.com (Nov 2024) & Ohio Capital Journal (May 2025): background on earlier SB 319 and audit data (six confirmed noncitizen votes). Factual context.  
• Federal contexts (SAVE Act, Trump EO, related state actions): federal momentum but legal and constitutional challenges expected. Mixed‐quality but consistent signal of nationwide GOP push.

4. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (+):  
– Republican supermajorities in Ohio legislature (structural factor).  
– SB 153 explicitly filed with citizenship‐verification language (direct mechanism).  
Moderate evidence (+/–):  
– Transportation budget’s BMV proof requirement has passed legislature but not yet signed (signals momentum but uncertain enactment).  
– Gov. DeWine’s cautious stance (“burden of proof on proponents”) reduces certainty of signature.  
Weak evidence (–):  
– Audit found near-zero noncitizen voting (undermines urgency).  
– Organized opposition from local election officials and voting-rights groups (could slow or kill the bill).

5. Timeframe analysis  
– 57 days remain.  
– SB 153 must clear committee, floor votes in both chambers, then see governor’s signature by July 1.  
– If timeframe halved (≈28 days), chances drop sharply (<10%). If doubled (114 days), chances rise significantly (≈60–70%).

6. Justification  
Starting from a 50% base rate for comparable GOP proof-of-citizenship bills, we halve to 25% for the compressed timeframe. We then modestly raise to account for Ohio’s Republican supermajorities (+15 points) but lower slightly to reflect Gov. DeWine’s cautious posture and vocal opposition (−5 points). This yields ~35%.

Probability calibration  
I assess a 35% chance Ohio will enact new proof-of-citizenship requirements by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Defined question and cutoff.  
2. Base rate: 50% adjusted to 25% for timeframe.  
3. Consistency: “35 out of 100 times, a GOP-led state with this momentum enacts such a law in 57 days.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Republican supermajority and SB 153 text (strong)  
   • BMV amendment passed but unsigned (moderate)  
   • DeWine’s caution (moderate)  
   • Short timeframe (strong)  
   • Low incidence of noncitizen voting (weak)  
5. Blind-spot: Gov. DeWine unexpectedly pocket-vetoes or vetoes—would drop to near 0%. If he signs uncontroversially, probability would jump to >60%.  
6. Status quo: No new requirements as of May 5; incremental changes likely if any.

Probability: 35%
Predicted Probability: 35.0%

Output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- BG Independent (Mar 2025): Local watchdog reporting on SB 153’s introduction and provisions. High reliability on bill text and sponsor quotes; no floor action yet.  
- LegiScan summary (Mar 2025): Basic bill‐status data on SB 153. Reliable for tracking referral but incomplete on content.  
- Cleveland.com (Nov 2024): Local newspaper on earlier SB 319. Accurate legislative context; opinion clearly attributed.  
- Statehouse News Bureau (Mar 2025): Nonpartisan, detailed on budget amendment for BMV‐citizenship check. Credible; highlights House/Senate wrangling and Gov. DeWine’s cautious stance.  
- Democracy Docket (Jul 2024) & other federal‐level articles: Reliable on federal SAVE Act momentum but limited direct bearing on Ohio.  
- AskNews articles (Apr–May 2025): Variety of state‐level efforts in other states; helps gauge national trend but uneven quality.  

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shift potential)  
- GOP trifecta in Ohio legislature supporting proof‐of‐citizenship bills (SB 153 introduced; Senate majority wields agenda).  
- Historical pattern: contentious late‐session election bills stall ~80% if not on floor by early May.  

Moderate evidence  
- Gov. DeWine’s public hesitation on new election laws; “burden of proof is on anyone who wants to change it.”  
- Active mobilization by voting‐rights groups (Common Cause, LWV) threatening public and legal pushback.  
- Passage of BMV Proof requirement in transportation budget only as an amendment stripped/replaced by House.  

Weak evidence  
- Federal SAVE Act passage in House signaling national GOP appetite.  
- Other states’ experiences with proof‐of‐citizenship laws (mixed success, but some get enacted).  

3. Timeframe analysis  
- 56 days remain until July 1, 2025.  
- If timeframe halved (~28 days), very low probability (<10%) due to legislative calendar.  
- If doubled (~112 days), moderate bump (+10–15 pts) as more floor time and hearings possible.  

4. Justification and inside‐view adjustment  
Outside view base rate: ~33% (state proof‐of‐citizenship bills historically).  
+10 pts for strong GOP control and recent introduction of SB 153.  
−15 pts for late‐session timing, no committee hearings scheduled as of early May, and Gov. DeWine’s reluctance to sign more election laws without clear constituent pressure and legislative prioritization.  
Net: ~28%.  

Inside-view factors pushing lower:  
- No floor votes or hearings scheduled on SB 153 or SB 319 analog as of May 5.  
- Competing priorities: budget bills, transportation package dominate legislative docket.  
- Gov. DeWine’s mixed record: he has signed some election measures but resisted burdensome new requirements without clear implementation plan.  

Inside-view adjustment: −8 pts for lack of visible momentum and razor‐thin window.  
Final probability: ~20%.  

Probability calibration  
Based on the above, I assign a final inside‐view forecast of 20% that Ohio will enact expanded voter citizenship verification legislation before July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Ohio enact a law requiring additional proof of U.S. citizenship for any voters before July 1, 2025?  
2. Base rate: ~33% for state‐level proof‐of‐citizenship bills.  
3. Consistency: “20 times out of 100, SB 153 (or similar) passes under these conditions.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   a. GOP legislative trifecta + SB 153 introduction (moderate).  
   b. Late-session historical stall rate ~80% (strong).  
   c. Gov. DeWine’s cautious public statements (moderate).  
   d. No floor hearings/votes yet (strong).  
   e. Active opposition by rights groups and legal preemption risk (moderate).  
5. Blind‐spot: A late omnibus election‐law package could slip proof requirements into a must-pass bill, boosting enactment odds.  
6. Status quo: Most contentious election reforms fail late; incremental changes more likely via admin rules, not new statutes.

Probability: 20%
Predicted Probability: 20.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
(Only sources containing Ohio-specific or directly analogous information are listed; others were discarded as noise.)

1. BGIndependent (5 Mar 2025).  Local straight-news story on SB 153 introduction; quotes sponsors and Wood County election director.  Reliable for bill content/date; opinions clearly attributed.  
2. LegiScan bill page (captured 30 Apr 2025).  Non-partisan tracking site; shows formal status (“referred to Government Oversight & Reform Committee,” no hearings yet).  Pure fact.  
3. Statehouse News Bureau (27 Mar 2025).  Capitol-press pool report on the $11 bn transportation budget; notes proof-of-citizenship language inserted by Senate, stripped by House; quotes Gov. DeWine’s lukewarm comments.  High quality, contemporaneous.  
4. Cleveland.com (1 Nov 2024).  Earlier attempt (SB 319) died with session; demonstrates recurring GOP interest.  Major newspaper, good factual reliability.  
5. NCSL data set on proof-of-citizenship laws (Jan 2025 update).  Reference material for base-rate (eight states with laws, four fully in force).  
6. Ohio legislative statistics 2019-2023 (LSC annual reviews).  Shows ~35 % of bills referred to committee ever become law; only ~20 % of those do so before 1 July of odd-numbered years.  
7. AskNews packet (4-5 May 2025).  Contains nationwide commentary on the federal SAVE Act and state analogues; corroborates partisan momentum but provides no Ohio-specific legislative movement after 27 Mar 2025.  Treated as moderate-indirect evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis  

Strong  
• Structural: Ohio is a Republican trifecta (Gov + Senate + House).  
• Calendar: A must-pass biennial operating budget is due 30 Jun 2025—commonly used as a vehicle for late policy riders.

Moderate  
• SB 153 is formally introduced but has had no hearing five weeks on.  
• In March, proof-of-citizenship language was stripped from the transportation budget during House–Senate negotiations, signalling divided GOP enthusiasm.  
• Governor DeWine’s public caution (“burden of proof is on anyone who wants another election-related law”).

Weak  
• National GOP messaging (SAVE Act, Trump executive order) could increase pressure but does not force Ohio action.  
• 2024 audit finding “no fraud” provides rhetorical ammunition to opponents, but not a binding constraint.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until 1 Jul 2025: 57.  Both chambers will meet roughly 10-14 regular session days plus budget hearings.  
If the window were halved to 28 days, probability would fall to ~10 %.  
If doubled to 114 days, probability would rise to ~28-30 %, reflecting the additional post-budget special-session possibilities.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  

Outside-view baseline (class: Ohio bills that clear committee by early May) = 17 %.

Adjustments  
+3 pp Republican trifecta & national election-integrity push give leadership the raw votes.  
+2 pp Omnibus operating budget offers a fast-track vehicle even for bills still in committee.  
−4 pp To date, no committee hearing; House stripped identical language in March; signals intra-caucus resistance and procedural drag.  
−1 pp Governor’s reluctance lowers leadership urgency; a veto (unlikely) or threat thereof would complicate the timetable.  

Net shift = 0 pp → inside-view probability ≈ 17–18 %.

Probability calibration
My 90 % CI: 8 % – 32 %.  Distribution is right-skewed (small chance of last-minute rider).  Central estimate: 18 %.

Checklist:  
1. Will Ohio enact proof-of-citizenship requirement before 1 Jul 2025?  
2. Base rate stated (17 %).  
3. “About 18 out of 100 times, the requirement is enacted by the deadline.”  
4. Key evidence: GOP trifecta; budget vehicle; no committee action; House previously removed similar language; governor lukewarm.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden voting-fraud news burst or Trump rally in Ohio could trigger a whip count flip and rapid passage.  
6. Status-quo bias checked—most Ohio election bills stall; slight lean back toward “No” retained.

Probability: 18%
Predicted Probability: 18.0%

- National/regional momentum with Trump administration support and similar bills advancing in nearby states
- Transportation budget approach shows willingness to use alternative legislative vehicles

**Downward factors:**
- Limited procedural progress (only committee referral, no recorded hearings/votes by May 5)
- Governor DeWine has expressed skepticism about further election law changes
- Only 57 days remain for complete legislative process
- Similar bills in previous sessions failed to reach enactment

The evidence supports a moderate increase from the outside view, but significant procedural hurdles and time constraints remain considerable limiting factors.

## Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 12%, I'll adjust based on the evidence analysis:

- +10 percentage points: Active concrete legislation with Republican supermajorities and demonstrated national/regional momentum
- -3 percentage points: Limited procedural progress with no reported committee votes yet
- -2 percentage points: Governor's expressed skepticism creates potential veto risk
- -1 percentage point: Tight 57-day timeframe for complete legislative passage

This yields a calibrated probability of 16%. 

In 16 out of 100 parallel universes, Ohio would enact proof-of-citizenship legislation before July 1, 2025. This feels reasonable given the evidence - there's a clear path to enactment through Republican supermajorities, but significant hurdles remain and the timeline is compressed.

## Checklist:
1. Will Ohio enact legislation requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voters before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view base rate: 12% from reference classes of similar laws in comparable states, timeframe-adjusted
3. 16 out of 100 times, Ohio would enact this legislation before July 1, 2025.
4. Key evidence: Active SB 153 with specific provisions; Republican supermajorities; limited procedural progress; Governor's skepticism; tight 57-day timeline
5. Blind spot: Bill could be attached as amendment to must-pass legislation in end-of-session maneuver
6. Status quo has been no citizenship verification requirements beyond attestation; short window favors status quo persistence

Probability: 16%
Predicted Probability: 16.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will Ohio pass and enact any new law, by July 1, 2025, requiring voters to show documentary proof of U.S. citizenship (beyond the current sworn-attestation system) as part of voter registration or ballot casting?

2. Outside‐view base‐rate  
Reference class: proof‐of‐citizenship bills in Republican‐controlled state legislatures introduced since 2020.  
– Of  eight such high-profile bills, four ultimately became law within roughly one year; three stalled; one died quickly.  
– Base rate: ~50% chance of enactment within one legislative cycle.  
But here the deadline (57 days) is unusually short, halving base rate → ~25%.

3. Source analysis  
• BG Independent (May 2025): detailed account of SB 153 (proof of citizenship + drop-box ban) introduced March 2025; bill in committee. High‐quality local reporting.  
• LegiScan (2025): Confirms SB 153’s citizenship‐verification provisions and sponsor info; bill only in committee. Factual.  
• Transportation‐budget article (March 27, 2025): both chambers passed a BMV proof‐of‐citizenship amendment; awaiting Gov. DeWine’s signature; he’s noncommittal. Reliable local news.  
• Cleveland.com (Nov 2024) & Ohio Capital Journal (May 2025): background on earlier SB 319 and audit data (six confirmed noncitizen votes). Factual context.  
• Federal contexts (SAVE Act, Trump EO, related state actions): federal momentum but legal and constitutional challenges expected. Mixed‐quality but consistent signal of nationwide GOP push.

4. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (+):  
– Republican supermajorities in Ohio legislature (structural factor).  
– SB 153 explicitly filed with citizenship‐verification language (direct mechanism).  
Moderate evidence (+/–):  
– Transportation budget’s BMV proof requirement has passed legislature but not yet signed (signals momentum but uncertain enactment).  
– Gov. DeWine’s cautious stance (“burden of proof on proponents”) reduces certainty of signature.  
Weak evidence (–):  
– Audit found near-zero noncitizen voting (undermines urgency).  
– Organized opposition from local election officials and voting-rights groups (could slow or kill the bill).

5. Timeframe analysis  
– 57 days remain.  
– SB 153 must clear committee, floor votes in both chambers, then see governor’s signature by July 1.  
– If timeframe halved (≈28 days), chances drop sharply (<10%). If doubled (114 days), chances rise significantly (≈60–70%).

6. Justification  
Starting from a 50% base rate for comparable GOP proof-of-citizenship bills, we halve to 25% for the compressed timeframe. We then modestly raise to account for Ohio’s Republican supermajorities (+15 points) but lower slightly to reflect Gov. DeWine’s cautious posture and vocal opposition (−5 points). This yields ~35%.

Probability calibration  
I assess a 35% chance Ohio will enact new proof-of-citizenship requirements by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Defined question and cutoff.  
2. Base rate: 50% adjusted to 25% for timeframe.  
3. Consistency: “35 out of 100 times, a GOP-led state with this momentum enacts such a law in 57 days.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Republican supermajority and SB 153 text (strong)  
   • BMV amendment passed but unsigned (moderate)  
   • DeWine’s caution (moderate)  
   • Short timeframe (strong)  
   • Low incidence of noncitizen voting (weak)  
5. Blind-spot: Gov. DeWine unexpectedly pocket-vetoes or vetoes—would drop to near 0%. If he signs uncontroversially, probability would jump to >60%.  
6. Status quo: No new requirements as of May 5; incremental changes likely if any.

Probability: 35%
Predicted Probability: 35.0%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- BG Independent (Mar 2025): Local watchdog reporting on SB 153’s introduction and provisions. High reliability on bill text and sponsor quotes; no floor action yet.  
- LegiScan summary (Mar 2025): Basic bill‐status data on SB 153. Reliable for tracking referral but incomplete on content.  
- Cleveland.com (Nov 2024): Local newspaper on earlier SB 319. Accurate legislative context; opinion clearly attributed.  
- Statehouse News Bureau (Mar 2025): Nonpartisan, detailed on budget amendment for BMV‐citizenship check. Credible; highlights House/Senate wrangling and Gov. DeWine’s cautious stance.  
- Democracy Docket (Jul 2024) & other federal‐level articles: Reliable on federal SAVE Act momentum but limited direct bearing on Ohio.  
- AskNews articles (Apr–May 2025): Variety of state‐level efforts in other states; helps gauge national trend but uneven quality.  

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shift potential)  
- GOP trifecta in Ohio legislature supporting proof‐of‐citizenship bills (SB 153 introduced; Senate majority wields agenda).  
- Historical pattern: contentious late‐session election bills stall ~80% if not on floor by early May.  

Moderate evidence  
- Gov. DeWine’s public hesitation on new election laws; “burden of proof is on anyone who wants to change it.”  
- Active mobilization by voting‐rights groups (Common Cause, LWV) threatening public and legal pushback.  
- Passage of BMV Proof requirement in transportation budget only as an amendment stripped/replaced by House.  

Weak evidence  
- Federal SAVE Act passage in House signaling national GOP appetite.  
- Other states’ experiences with proof‐of‐citizenship laws (mixed success, but some get enacted).  

3. Timeframe analysis  
- 56 days remain until July 1, 2025.  
- If timeframe halved (~28 days), very low probability (<10%) due to legislative calendar.  
- If doubled (~112 days), moderate bump (+10–15 pts) as more floor time and hearings possible.  

4. Justification and inside‐view adjustment  
Outside view base rate: ~33% (state proof‐of‐citizenship bills historically).  
+10 pts for strong GOP control and recent introduction of SB 153.  
−15 pts for late‐session timing, no committee hearings scheduled as of early May, and Gov. DeWine’s reluctance to sign more election laws without clear constituent pressure and legislative prioritization.  
Net: ~28%.  

Inside-view factors pushing lower:  
- No floor votes or hearings scheduled on SB 153 or SB 319 analog as of May 5.  
- Competing priorities: budget bills, transportation package dominate legislative docket.  
- Gov. DeWine’s mixed record: he has signed some election measures but resisted burdensome new requirements without clear implementation plan.  

Inside-view adjustment: −8 pts for lack of visible momentum and razor‐thin window.  
Final probability: ~20%.  

Probability calibration  
Based on the above, I assign a final inside‐view forecast of 20% that Ohio will enact expanded voter citizenship verification legislation before July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Ohio enact a law requiring additional proof of U.S. citizenship for any voters before July 1, 2025?  
2. Base rate: ~33% for state‐level proof‐of‐citizenship bills.  
3. Consistency: “20 times out of 100, SB 153 (or similar) passes under these conditions.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   a. GOP legislative trifecta + SB 153 introduction (moderate).  
   b. Late-session historical stall rate ~80% (strong).  
   c. Gov. DeWine’s cautious public statements (moderate).  
   d. No floor hearings/votes yet (strong).  
   e. Active opposition by rights groups and legal preemption risk (moderate).  
5. Blind‐spot: A late omnibus election‐law package could slip proof requirements into a must-pass bill, boosting enactment odds.  
6. Status quo: Most contentious election reforms fail late; incremental changes more likely via admin rules, not new statutes.

Probability: 20%
Predicted Probability: 20.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
(Only sources containing Ohio-specific or directly analogous information are listed; others were discarded as noise.)

1. BGIndependent (5 Mar 2025).  Local straight-news story on SB 153 introduction; quotes sponsors and Wood County election director.  Reliable for bill content/date; opinions clearly attributed.  
2. LegiScan bill page (captured 30 Apr 2025).  Non-partisan tracking site; shows formal status (“referred to Government Oversight & Reform Committee,” no hearings yet).  Pure fact.  
3. Statehouse News Bureau (27 Mar 2025).  Capitol-press pool report on the $11 bn transportation budget; notes proof-of-citizenship language inserted by Senate, stripped by House; quotes Gov. DeWine’s lukewarm comments.  High quality, contemporaneous.  
4. Cleveland.com (1 Nov 2024).  Earlier attempt (SB 319) died with session; demonstrates recurring GOP interest.  Major newspaper, good factual reliability.  
5. NCSL data set on proof-of-citizenship laws (Jan 2025 update).  Reference material for base-rate (eight states with laws, four fully in force).  
6. Ohio legislative statistics 2019-2023 (LSC annual reviews).  Shows ~35 % of bills referred to committee ever become law; only ~20 % of those do so before 1 July of odd-numbered years.  
7. AskNews packet (4-5 May 2025).  Contains nationwide commentary on the federal SAVE Act and state analogues; corroborates partisan momentum but provides no Ohio-specific legislative movement after 27 Mar 2025.  Treated as moderate-indirect evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis  

Strong  
• Structural: Ohio is a Republican trifecta (Gov + Senate + House).  
• Calendar: A must-pass biennial operating budget is due 30 Jun 2025—commonly used as a vehicle for late policy riders.

Moderate  
• SB 153 is formally introduced but has had no hearing five weeks on.  
• In March, proof-of-citizenship language was stripped from the transportation budget during House–Senate negotiations, signalling divided GOP enthusiasm.  
• Governor DeWine’s public caution (“burden of proof is on anyone who wants another election-related law”).

Weak  
• National GOP messaging (SAVE Act, Trump executive order) could increase pressure but does not force Ohio action.  
• 2024 audit finding “no fraud” provides rhetorical ammunition to opponents, but not a binding constraint.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until 1 Jul 2025: 57.  Both chambers will meet roughly 10-14 regular session days plus budget hearings.  
If the window were halved to 28 days, probability would fall to ~10 %.  
If doubled to 114 days, probability would rise to ~28-30 %, reflecting the additional post-budget special-session possibilities.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  

Outside-view baseline (class: Ohio bills that clear committee by early May) = 17 %.

Adjustments  
+3 pp Republican trifecta & national election-integrity push give leadership the raw votes.  
+2 pp Omnibus operating budget offers a fast-track vehicle even for bills still in committee.  
−4 pp To date, no committee hearing; House stripped identical language in March; signals intra-caucus resistance and procedural drag.  
−1 pp Governor’s reluctance lowers leadership urgency; a veto (unlikely) or threat thereof would complicate the timetable.  

Net shift = 0 pp → inside-view probability ≈ 17–18 %.

Probability calibration
My 90 % CI: 8 % – 32 %.  Distribution is right-skewed (small chance of last-minute rider).  Central estimate: 18 %.

Checklist:  
1. Will Ohio enact proof-of-citizenship requirement before 1 Jul 2025?  
2. Base rate stated (17 %).  
3. “About 18 out of 100 times, the requirement is enacted by the deadline.”  
4. Key evidence: GOP trifecta; budget vehicle; no committee action; House previously removed similar language; governor lukewarm.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden voting-fraud news burst or Trump rally in Ohio could trigger a whip count flip and rapid passage.  
6. Status-quo bias checked—most Ohio election bills stall; slight lean back toward “No” retained.

Probability: 18%
Predicted Probability: 18.0%...
