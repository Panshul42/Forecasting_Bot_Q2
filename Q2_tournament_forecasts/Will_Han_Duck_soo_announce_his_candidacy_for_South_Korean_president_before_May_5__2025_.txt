Analysis:
This question hinges on understanding the typical timing and drivers of presidential candidacy announcements in South Korea, especially for high‑profile figures like former prime ministers or acting presidents drafted by their party. Historically, major party candidates reveal their bids several months before the June election—often 4–6 months out—making a declaration within one month of the vote highly unusual. To establish a baseline (out‑view), I need data on past announcement dates relative to election day, average lead times, and any rare late filings. I also want precedent for parties “drafting” non‑candidates (e.g., acting prime ministers) and whether those calls led to actual bids. These insights will inform how exceptional a late April/early May announcement by Han Duck‑soo would be and help set a base‑rate probability.

Analysis:
Han Duck‑soo’s potential candidacy hinges on recent shifts within the People Power Party (PPP) and any public statements he or senior PPP figures have made regarding a formal announcement. With fewer than two weeks until the May 5 deadline, key information includes: announcements or hints from Han himself; internal PPP deliberations or drafting campaigns; endorsements from influential party factions; and any changes in his public schedule suggesting mounting preparations. Historical context shows that major Korean political figures typically signal intentions through controlled media op-eds or televised interviews roughly one to two weeks before formal declarations. An inside‑view forecast requires the latest news on whether those signals have occurred or are imminent.

Summary of “South Korea Sets New Presidential Election for June 3” (New York Times, April 8, 2025)

Facts and key details
• Snap election scheduled for June 3, 2025, to replace impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol  
• Constitutional Court unanimously upheld Yoon’s impeachment (8–0) after his attempt to impose martial law  
• By law, a new president must be elected within 60 days of the court’s ruling  
• June 3 declared a national holiday to boost turnout  
• Rival parties must complete primaries by May 12; official campaign also begins May 12  
• Election winner will assume office immediately (no two‑month transition)  
• Prime Minister Han Duck‑soo is serving as unelected interim leader until the new president takes office  

Opposition Democratic Party  
• Lee Jae‑myung (party leader; narrowly lost 2022 election) is the clear front‑runner in polls, leading by about 25 percentage points  
• Lee is expected to resign as party chairman to focus on his presidential bid  
• He faces several criminal charges, including bribery, which he alleges are politically motivated  

People Power Party (conservatives)  
• More than a dozen potential candidates have declared, including Labor Minister Kim Moon‑soo  
• No consensus front‑runner has emerged, partly because the party had been focused on defending Yoon’s presidency  
• Yoon’s impeachment is the second in a row for a conservative president; he also faces an insurrection trial over his December martial‑law orders  

Broader context  
• South Korea remains led by Han Duck‑soo amid rising external pressures: U.S. tariffs on Korean goods and North Korea’s advancing nuclear program and closer ties with Russia  
• The political crisis has deepened partisan polarization, with conservatives (including right‑wing YouTube influencers) pushing allegations of election rigging and “anti‑state” collusion by progressives, while the Democratic Party accuses them of smears to divert attention from Yoon’s failures

Here is a focused summary of the AP News article (April 8, 2025):

• Election timing and context  
  – Acting President Han Duck‑soo announced on April 8 that a snap presidential election will be held June 3, 2025.  
  – The vote follows the Constitutional Court’s unanimous removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol; South Korean law requires an election within 60 days.  
  – The winner will serve a full five‑year term.  

• Political landscape  
  – Deep polarization: a two‑way contest between Yoon’s conservative People Power Party (PPP) and the liberal Democratic Party (DP), which controls the National Assembly.  
  – The PPP is weakened by internal divisions and reputational damage from Yoon’s brief imposition of martial law late last year.  

• Democratic Party front‑runner  
  – Lee Jae‑myung is all but assured the DP nomination; he narrowly lost in 2022 and led the party’s resistance to martial law and the subsequent impeachment of Yoon.  
  – Lee faces five ongoing trials for alleged corruption; presidential immunity would likely halt those prosecutions if he wins.  

• People Power Party field  
  – About ten PPP figures are expected to run in primaries.  
    • Kim Moon Soo (Labor Minister): most pro‑Yoon  
    • Hong Joon‑pyo (Daegu Mayor): opposed Yoon’s impeachment  
    • Han Dong‑hoon (former party leader) and Ahn Cheol‑soo (senior lawmaker): supported impeaching Yoon  
    • Oh Se‑hoon (Seoul Mayor): has taken an ambiguous stance  
  – Yoon, now facing a rebellion charge and potentially further charges, is likely to back pro‑Yoon candidates for nomination and party leadership.  

• Expert opinions (all named sources)  
  – Leif‑Eric Easley (Ewha University): “The conservative party faces significant disadvantages… Two months is a short time to unify the base, moderates and a conspiracy‑driven fringe around a single candidate.”  
  – Choi Jin (Institute of Presidential Leadership): PPP leadership “filled with Yoon loyalists” will perpetuate internal divides and damage electoral prospects.  
  – Duyeon Kim (Center for a New American Security): PPP must nominate someone who can win over moderates and young swing voters, not merely prevail in party primaries.

Background & Election Announcement

Political Landscape

  – Considered the clear favourite despite five ongoing criminal trials (which would be suspended if he wins)  
  – Expected to step down as party leader and formally enter the race imminently

Party Dynamics & Challenges  
• Yoon’s martial‑law decision: brought troops into Seoul, evoked memories of past military rule, and damaged the PPP’s reputation despite not being a direct party action  
• Reformist PPP members impeached Yoon, deepening rifts with loyalists  
• Die‑hard Yoon supporters hold large rallies and espouse conspiracy theories about a “leftist” plot  
• Experts’ take:  
  – Leif‑Eric Easley (Ewha University): Two months is “a short time to unify base, moderates and a conspiracy‑driven fringe.”  
  – Choi Jin (Institute of Presidential Leadership): The PPP’s Yoon‑loyalist leadership will perpetuate internal divides.

Article source: AFP via France 24, April 8, 2025.

Key facts and figures  
- South Korea’s acting president, Prime Minister Han Duck‑soo, has set a new presidential election for June 3, 2025, to comply with the Constitutional Court’s ruling that former president Yoon Suk Yeol’s December declaration of martial law was unconstitutional.  
- Under the constitution, the election must occur within 60 days of the court’s decision, which upheld Yoon’s impeachment and removed him from office.  
- June 3 will be a temporary public holiday; the winner is to be inaugurated on June 4 (normal transitions allow a two‑month interval).  
- Official campaign period: May 12–June 2, 2025.

Political context  
- Han Duck‑soo resumed the acting presidency after his own impeachment was overturned by the Constitutional Court. He has tasked government ministries and the National Election Commission with ensuring “a fairer and more transparent” vote.  
- The main frontrunner is opposition leader Lee Jae‑myung, with 34% support in the latest Gallup poll. His Democratic Party holds a parliamentary majority.  
   • Sources told AFP Lee plans to resign as party leader to run officially for the nomination.  
   • Lee Jae‑myung narrowly lost the 2022 election and faces ongoing legal trials.  
- Labour Minister Kim Moon‑soo ranks a distant second at about 9% support, leading a group of People Power Party hopefuls including former party chief Han Dong‑hoon.

Expert opinion  
- Lee Jun‑han, politics professor at Incheon National University (AFP): “With the election date so soon, it’s hard to expect a presidential candidate from an impeached party to be elected president… Lee Jae‑myung has high approval ratings and… doesn’t have a proper challenger.”

Background  
- Yoon Suk Yeol attempted to use martial law to subvert civilian rule in December; the Constitutional Court livestreamed its verdict stripping him of office. He is the second South Korean leader impeached by the court (after Park Geun‑hye in 2017).  
- South Korea has lacked an effective head of state for four months, during which it faced an aviation disaster, the deadliest wildfires in its history, and US‐imposed 26% tariffs on its exports under reciprocal‐levies announced by former President Trump.  
- Yoon also faces separate criminal charges of insurrection over his martial‐law bid.

Disclaimer: While the headline references “US tariffs,” the provided excerpt does not elaborate on that topic.  

Key points from the South China Morning Post article (April 22, 2025):

• Lee Jae‑myung (liberal Democratic Party of Korea) has surpassed 50 percent support in snap‑election polls for the first time.  
  – Real Meter survey (released Monday): Lee at 50.2 percent, up 1.4 percentage points week‑on‑week.  

• His closest rival, Kim Moon‑soo (conservative People Power Party, former labour minister), stands at 12.2 percent, up 1.3 points.  

• Analysts attribute Lee’s surge to:  
  – The political upheaval and fragmentation of the conservative bloc following former president Yoon Suk‑yeol’s impeachment.  
  – Yoon’s removal stemmed from his controversial December 3 declaration of martial law.  

• Within the DPK’s nomination contest for the June 3 snap election, Lee has secured about 90 percent of votes in the first two of four primary rounds. The party’s formal nomination is set for April 27.  

• Acting President Han Duck‑soo, Lee’s potential conservative rival, “stays coy” about whether he will run in the June 3 snap elections.

**Han Duck-soo's Presidential Campaign Under the Guise of Trade Talks**
Han Duck-soo, the acting president and prime minister, has been self-praising his 'diplomatic efforts' ahead of the '2+2 high-level trade talks' with the US on April 24, saying that the US also values its relationship with South Korea. However, the opposition Democratic Party and other former opposition parties are criticizing and expressing concerns about Han's 'presidential campaign' under the guise of 'responding to trade issues'. Han said, 'The government will make every effort to find a mutually beneficial solution through calm and sincere negotiations with the US, based on the principle of 'national interest first'. He emphasized that the government will focus on finding a solution to the three key areas of trade imbalance, shipbuilding, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) mentioned by President Trump in their phone call. However, some members of the National Assembly's People Power Party are speculating that Han will resign as prime minister and announce his candidacy for the presidential election within this month. Conservative civic groups and former ruling party officials are also calling for Han to run in the presidential election. The Democratic Party is criticizing Han's actions as 'irresponsible' and 'abandoning his duties as a public official', as he is effectively campaigning for the presidential election without announcing his candidacy. The party's 'Trade and Security Task Force' held its first meeting in the National Assembly and criticized Han for rushing the trade talks with the US, saying that it would be a 'lose-lose situation' for South Korea. Kim Hyun-jong, the former head of the National Security Office, said, 'Those who rush the negotiations will definitely lose.' Kim Min-seok, the party's highest-ranking official, also said, 'The task of resolving the trade issues with the US is to remove the 'Han Duck-soo risk' that comes after the 'Yoon Seok-yeol risk'. He emphasized that it is the responsibility of the acting prime minister, the minister of economy and finance, and other officials to carefully consider the national interest and hand over the task to the new government.'

**Korean People's Power Party Watches Han Duck-soo's Presidential Ambitions**
The Korean People's Power Party (국민의힘) is closely watching the possibility of Han Duck-soo, the acting Prime Minister, running for the presidency. In an interview with the Financial Times, Han said he had not yet decided whether to run, leaving the door open for a potential candidacy. The party's internal dynamics are complex, with some members calling for Han to run and others urging him to step down. Hong Jun-pyo, a party candidate, criticized Han's potential candidacy, saying it was 'extremely unreasonable.' Han Dong-hoon, another candidate, said that Han's indecision was causing unnecessary controversy and distracting from the party's primary election. Ahn Cheol-soo, a candidate, urged Han to focus on governance rather than running for president. Na Kyung-won, a candidate, said Han's 'no comment' response was 'unbecoming and dishonest.' Yu Jeong-bok, a candidate, emphasized the need to focus on selecting the best candidate for the party's primary election rather than engaging in 'meaningless debates.'

**Han Duck-soo Hesitates on Presidential Bid, Vows No Retaliation to US Tariffs**
South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo has not yet decided whether to run for president, according to his own statements. In an interview with the Financial Times, he declined to comment on the possibility of a presidential candidacy in June. However, he had previously told US President Donald Trump in a phone call that he was still considering a bid for the presidency. Han stated that South Korea will not retaliate against US tariffs and instead wants to find mutually beneficial solutions through negotiations. He also mentioned that the cost-sharing of US troop stationing in Korea may be discussed in trade talks, but no clear framework for security discussions has been established. Han signaled willingness to revisit a deal with the Biden administration on cost-sharing for US troops in South Korea, 'depending on the topics'.

**South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck Soo Remains Indecisive on Presidential Candidacy**
South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck Soo, who is currently serving as acting president, has yet to decide whether to run as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections. In a recent interview with The Financial Times, published on April 20, Han reiterated his indecision and responded with 'no comment' when pressed by the interviewer. This stance aligns with his previous statement during a phone call with US President Donald Trump, in which he said he is still examining the possibility of running. Han also clarified that the powers of the acting president are clearly outlined in the Constitution and related laws, stating that his functions do not differ from those of the national president.

**Han Duck-soo 'Not Yet' Decides on Presidential Run**
Han Duck-soo, the acting president of South Korea, said, 'I have not yet decided' on whether to run in the presidential election. In an interview with the Financial Times, Han responded directly to questions about his potential candidacy, saying, 'I have not yet decided.' He refused to comment further on the issue, despite repeated questions. Han also addressed concerns that his role as acting president, particularly leading trade negotiations with the US, would limit his ability to act as president. He said, 'There is no difference between the authority of an acting president and a elected president.' Han has been in talks with US President Trump, and has expressed a willingness to reduce the trade deficit with the US. He said, 'We are considering reducing the trade deficit by purchasing US liquefied natural gas and aircraft.' Han visited a large church in Seoul on Easter Sunday, and sent a message to the Korean Christian Mission's 140th anniversary Easter union service. He said, 'The government will do its best to unite the people and promote their strength.' He also emphasized the importance of unity, saying, 'Unity is the key to overcoming crises.' However, some have interpreted his emphasis on unity as a sign that he is considering a presidential run. The Democratic Party has called for Han to resign from his position, saying, 'In effect, Han has announced his candidacy' and 'He has no authority as acting president.'

**Han Duck-soo Leaves Door Open for Presidential Run, Sparking Speculation**
Han Duck-soo, the acting President of South Korea, has left the door open for a potential presidential run in the 2025 election. In an interview with the Financial Times, he stated, 'I have not yet made a decision' when asked about running for president. This ambiguous stance has added complexity to the calculations of the main candidates from each party. Han Duck-soo emphasized that he will do his best to ensure a smooth transition to the next government, as per the Constitution and laws. However, his experience in governance, international perspective, and subtle factional color have earned him praise from the conservative camp, making him a potential alternative candidate. In the interview, Han Duck-soo also stated that South Korea will not retaliate against the US's tariffs, but will instead seek a mutually beneficial solution. He emphasized that the President's authority is derived from the Constitution and laws, and that he will not make any decisions that could compromise the country's national interests. He also hinted at the possibility of revisiting the defense cost-sharing agreement with the US, depending on the circumstances. The Democratic Party has strongly criticized Han Duck-soo's comments, calling them a 'de facto announcement of his candidacy' and accusing him of being driven by ambition and neglecting his duties as acting President.

However, his potential candidacy is still met with skepticism, with 66% of respondents in a separate poll saying it would be 'unacceptable' for him to run. The Democratic Party of Korea has criticized Han's actions, saying he is using his position as acting president to further his own interests.

**Han Duck-soo's Presidential Bid: A Divided Conservative Party**
South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo's potential candidacy for the upcoming presidential election has sparked debate within the conservative ruling party. In an interview with the Financial Times, Han said, 'I have not decided yet' and refused to comment on the matter. The call for Han's candidacy has come from within the conservative ruling party, Nation's Power, as their own candidates are trailing behind Lee Jae-myung, the former leader of the progressive opposition party, in opinion polls. Lee has a significant lead in the polls, making Han's candidacy a potential game-changer in the election.

**Han Duck-soo's Presidential Campaign Under the Guise of Trade Talks**
Han Duck-soo, the acting president and prime minister, has been self-praising his 'diplomatic efforts' ahead of the '2+2 high-level trade talks' with the US on April 24, saying that the US also values its relationship with South Korea. However, the opposition Democratic Party and other former opposition parties are criticizing and expressing concerns about Han's 'presidential campaign' under the guise of 'responding to trade issues'. Han said, 'The government will make every effort to find a mutually beneficial solution through calm and sincere negotiations with the US, based on the principle of 'national interest first'. He emphasized that the government will focus on finding a solution to the three key areas of trade imbalance, shipbuilding, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) mentioned by President Trump in their phone call. However, some members of the National Assembly's People Power Party are speculating that Han will resign as prime minister and announce his candidacy for the presidential election within this month. Conservative civic groups and former ruling party officials are also calling for Han to run in the presidential election. The Democratic Party is criticizing Han's actions as 'irresponsible' and 'abandoning his duties as a public official', as he is effectively campaigning for the presidential election without announcing his candidacy. The party's 'Trade and Security Task Force' held its first meeting in the National Assembly and criticized Han for rushing the trade talks with the US, saying that it would be a 'lose-lose situation' for South Korea. Kim Hyun-jong, the former head of the National Security Office, said, 'Those who rush the negotiations will definitely lose.' Kim Min-seok, the party's highest-ranking official, also said, 'The task of resolving the trade issues with the US is to remove the 'Han Duck-soo risk' that comes after the 'Yoon Seok-yeol risk'. He emphasized that it is the responsibility of the acting prime minister, the minister of economy and finance, and other officials to carefully consider the national interest and hand over the task to the new government.'

**Korean People's Power Party Watches Han Duck-soo's Presidential Ambitions**
The Korean People's Power Party (국민의힘) is closely watching the possibility of Han Duck-soo, the acting Prime Minister, running for the presidency. In an interview with the Financial Times, Han said he had not yet decided whether to run, leaving the door open for a potential candidacy. The party's internal dynamics are complex, with some members calling for Han to run and others urging him to step down. Hong Jun-pyo, a party candidate, criticized Han's potential candidacy, saying it was 'extremely unreasonable.' Han Dong-hoon, another candidate, said that Han's indecision was causing unnecessary controversy and distracting from the party's primary election. Ahn Cheol-soo, a candidate, urged Han to focus on governance rather than running for president. Na Kyung-won, a candidate, said Han's 'no comment' response was 'unbecoming and dishonest.' Yu Jeong-bok, a candidate, emphasized the need to focus on selecting the best candidate for the party's primary election rather than engaging in 'meaningless debates.'

South Korean acting President Han Duck-soo announced that he will hold talks with the US on April 24 to find a mutually beneficial solution to the ongoing trade war.

Han emphasized that the talks will focus on trade balance, shipbuilding, and LNG, and that the government will not 'fight back' against the US.

However, the opposition party, the Democratic Party, criticized Han's statement, saying that he is 'nationally betraying' by not declaring his candidacy for the presidential election and instead focusing on the trade talks.

**Han Duck-soo Hesitates on Presidential Bid, Vows No Retaliation to US Tariffs**
South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo has not yet decided whether to run for president, according to his own statements. In an interview with the Financial Times, he declined to comment on the possibility of a presidential candidacy in June. However, he had previously told US President Donald Trump in a phone call that he was still considering a bid for the presidency. Han stated that South Korea will not retaliate against US tariffs and instead wants to find mutually beneficial solutions through negotiations. He also mentioned that the cost-sharing of US troop stationing in Korea may be discussed in trade talks, but no clear framework for security discussions has been established. Han signaled willingness to revisit a deal with the Biden administration on cost-sharing for US troops in South Korea, 'depending on the topics'.

**South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck Soo Remains Indecisive on Presidential Candidacy**
South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck Soo, who is currently serving as acting president, has yet to decide whether to run as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections. In a recent interview with The Financial Times, published on April 20, Han reiterated his indecision and responded with 'no comment' when pressed by the interviewer. This stance aligns with his previous statement during a phone call with US President Donald Trump, in which he said he is still examining the possibility of running. Han also clarified that the powers of the acting president are clearly outlined in the Constitution and related laws, stating that his functions do not differ from those of the national president.

**Han Duck-soo 'Not Yet' Decides on Presidential Run**
Han Duck-soo, the acting president of South Korea, said, 'I have not yet decided' on whether to run in the presidential election. In an interview with the Financial Times, Han responded directly to questions about his potential candidacy, saying, 'I have not yet decided.' He refused to comment further on the issue, despite repeated questions. Han also addressed concerns that his role as acting president, particularly leading trade negotiations with the US, would limit his ability to act as president. He said, 'There is no difference between the authority of an acting president and a elected president.' Han has been in talks with US President Trump, and has expressed a willingness to reduce the trade deficit with the US. He said, 'We are considering reducing the trade deficit by purchasing US liquefied natural gas and aircraft.' Han visited a large church in Seoul on Easter Sunday, and sent a message to the Korean Christian Mission's 140th anniversary Easter union service. He said, 'The government will do its best to unite the people and promote their strength.' He also emphasized the importance of unity, saying, 'Unity is the key to overcoming crises.' However, some have interpreted his emphasis on unity as a sign that he is considering a presidential run. The Democratic Party has called for Han to resign from his position, saying, 'In effect, Han has announced his candidacy' and 'He has no authority as acting president.'

**Han Duck-soo Leaves Door Open for Presidential Run, Sparking Speculation**
Han Duck-soo, the acting President of South Korea, has left the door open for a potential presidential run in the 2025 election. In an interview with the Financial Times, he stated, 'I have not yet made a decision' when asked about running for president. This ambiguous stance has added complexity to the calculations of the main candidates from each party. Han Duck-soo emphasized that he will do his best to ensure a smooth transition to the next government, as per the Constitution and laws. However, his experience in governance, international perspective, and subtle factional color have earned him praise from the conservative camp, making him a potential alternative candidate. In the interview, Han Duck-soo also stated that South Korea will not retaliate against the US's tariffs, but will instead seek a mutually beneficial solution. He emphasized that the President's authority is derived from the Constitution and laws, and that he will not make any decisions that could compromise the country's national interests. He also hinted at the possibility of revisiting the defense cost-sharing agreement with the US, depending on the circumstances. The Democratic Party has strongly criticized Han Duck-soo's comments, calling them a 'de facto announcement of his candidacy' and accusing him of being driven by ambition and neglecting his duties as acting President.

**Han Duck-soo's Unclear Stance on Presidential Candidacy Sparks Debate**
Han Duck-soo, the acting president of South Korea, has not made a clear statement about his intention to run for president in the upcoming election. In an interview with the Financial Times, he said, 'I have not yet decided' and 'no comment' when asked about his potential candidacy. This is the first time he has publicly expressed his opinion on the matter. Despite his unclear stance, his approval rating has increased among conservatives, with a recent Gallup poll showing 7% of respondents supporting him. However, his potential candidacy is still met with skepticism, with 66% of respondents in a separate poll saying it would be 'unacceptable' for him to run. The Democratic Party of Korea has criticized Han's actions, saying he is using his position as acting president to further his own interests.

**Speculation Grows Over Acting President Han's Possible Presidential Bid**
Speculation is growing that Acting President Han Duck-soo may run in the upcoming presidential election, despite calls for him to step down after the impeachment of the previous administration. A group of 54 lawmakers from the ruling People Power Party (PPP) prepared a statement urging Han to declare his candidacy, but party leadership intervened to halt the move. Han has stopped short of explicitly ruling out a run, and many observers believe he is intentionally maintaining ambiguity until the legal deadline to step down from office and enter the race on May 4. This uncertainty is casting a shadow over the ruling party's primary, and some believe that the PPP sees little promise in its declared candidates. The party leadership has reportedly urged members to refrain from publicly discussing Han, but signs suggest that party strategists are already considering a broader coalition or 'big tent' arrangement following the primary. However, a coalition that includes opposition candidates who oppose Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung seems implausible. The PPP's base remains demoralized and disengaged, and the party must offer its supporters a sense that it is now committed to taking the right path in order to reenergize its base and bring voters back to the polls.

**(News Focus) Presidential aspirants step up campaigns to clinch party nominations | Yonhap News Agency**
Presidential contenders in South Korea have stepped up their campaigns ahead of the June 3 election. Lee Jae-myung, former leader of the Democratic Party (DP), is leading the polls, while the People Power Party (PPP) has yet to establish a clear front-runner. Eleven PPP candidates have launched their campaigns, seeking support from Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, who has announced that he will not run in the upcoming election. Former Labor Minister Kim Moon-soo has pledged to adopt Oh's welfare policies in his campaign platform. Meanwhile, acting President Han Duck-soo is widely viewed as one of the strongest contenders within the conservative camp, but has not officially mentioned his potential bid. The DP has formally launched its primary, with three candidates in the running: Lee, Gyeonggi Province Gov. Kim Dong-yeon, and Kim Kyung-soo, a former South Gyeongsang Province Gov. and a close confidante of former President Moon Jae-in. Lee is widely expected to secure the nomination, saying, 'We will engage in a clean and fair competition while refraining from negative campaigning.'

**Han Duck-soo's 'Last Mission' Sparks Speculation About Presidential Run**
Han Duck-soo, the acting president and prime minister, mentioned 'my last mission' during the National Assembly meeting on April 14, stating that 'we have entered the time for a full-scale negotiation with the US government' and 'I will fulfill the mission entrusted to me by the ministers.' However, he did not directly mention whether he would run for the presidential election. This has led to speculation that he is maintaining 'strategic ambiguity' to weigh his options. Han Duck-soo emphasized the importance of focusing on the US-Korea trade negotiation, which has been ongoing since the US government's announcement of a 90-day tariff exemption. He also stated that he would communicate directly with US President Donald Trump if necessary. Some politicians have interpreted Han's statement as a sign that he will not run for the election, while others believe that he is still considering his options. A key figure in the National Assembly said that Han is 'choosing strategic ambiguity' and will make a final decision based on his popularity ratings. Another politician suggested that Han may run as an independent candidate and then merge with the winning candidate. A survey conducted by RealMeters showed that Han Duck-soo is in third place with 8.6% of the vote, behind Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo. Some politicians have expressed support for Han's potential candidacy, citing his popularity ratings as a factor in his decision-making process.

**Han Duck-soo's Presidential Bid: A Test of the People Power Party's Leadership**
The possibility of Han Duck-soo, the acting president of South Korea, running in the presidential election has been a topic of discussion within the conservative party, the People Power Party. Some members of the party have called for Han to run, citing his experience and ability to respond to the country's economic and diplomatic challenges. However, Han has not made a clear statement on the matter, fueling speculation that he may be considering a run. This has led to criticism from the opposition party, the Democratic Party of Korea, which has accused Han of using his position to further his own political ambitions. The situation has also sparked debate within the People Power Party, with some members calling for Han to run and others opposing the idea. The party's leadership has been accused of trying to manipulate the election process to favor Han's candidacy. The opposition party has also accused the People Power Party of trying to use Han's candidacy to distract from the party's own internal conflicts. The situation is seen as a test of the party's leadership and its ability to manage the election process fairly. 'It is a matter of historical responsibility for the acting president to respond to the people's demands,' said Rep. Seong Il-jong, a senior member of the People Power Party. 'I am calling on the acting president to run in the election.' However, Han has not made a clear statement on the matter, and the situation remains uncertain. The opposition party has also accused the People Power Party of trying to use Han's candidacy to distract from the party's own internal conflicts. 'The People Power Party is trying to use Han's candidacy to distract from the party's own internal conflicts,' said Rep. Kim Min-seok, a senior member of the Democratic Party of Korea.

**Han Duck-soo's Silence on Presidential Bid Sparks Speculation**
Despite growing calls within the People Power Party (PPP) for Han Duck-soo, the acting president, to be nominated as a presidential candidate, Han remains silent. Analysts believe that Han is deliberating on whether to run for the presidency. The PPP is expected to announce its presidential candidate by the end of this week, and Han's position will be closely watched. Some PPP lawmakers who were planning to hold a press conference to urge Han to run for the presidency cancelled their plans at the last minute, reportedly due to pressure from the party leadership. However, the calls for Han to be nominated as a candidate are gaining momentum within the party. This is partly because some members believe that Han's potential candidacy would be a decisive factor in the party's presidential nomination. According to one analysis, more than half of the party's incumbent lawmakers support Han's nomination. PPP Representative Kwon Sung-dong said, 'I think it's not bad, it's good. I think this way.' However, Han remains silent, despite his emphasis on completing his final duties as acting president after the Constitutional Court's decision to acquit him. Han has not officially confirmed his decision not to run for the presidency since the impeachment of former President Yoon. His silence is seen as a sign that he is still deliberating on whether to run. The PPP is expected to announce its presidential candidate by the end of this week, and Han's position will be closely watched.

**People Power Party Leadership Asks Lawmakers to Refrain from Calling for Han Duck-soo's Candidacy**
The leadership of the People Power Party (PPP) has asked its lawmakers to refrain from holding a press conference to call for President Han Duck-soo's candidacy for the upcoming presidential election. The lawmakers had planned to hold a press conference on April 13 to announce their support for Han's candidacy, but the party's leadership has asked them to cancel the event. According to a party official, the leadership has requested the lawmakers to refrain from holding the press conference because it may create an unfair situation in the election. The official stated, 'The leadership is committed to managing the election fairly.' However, some lawmakers from the PPP have announced that they will still hold a press conference on April 13 to call for Han's candidacy. The party's leadership has not endorsed this move.

**Han Duck-soo Considers Presidential Run, Surprising Presidential Office**
South Korean acting President Han Duck-soo has been considering running for president, according to a statement he made to US President Donald Trump. Trump asked Han if he had any plans to participate in the presidential election, to which Han replied, 'Because there are various requirements and circumstances, I am considering it. I have not made a decision yet.' Han's response was met with surprise from the presidential office, as he usually avoids discussing his potential candidacy. Han has been focused on addressing the US's equal tariffs issue, which Trump has temporarily suspended for 90 days. Han instructed the Korean embassy in the US to actively communicate and negotiate with relevant US agencies, including the National Security Council, State Department, and Commerce Department. Han emphasized the importance of making progress in all negotiations within the next 90 days to alleviate the tariff burden. Some members of the ruling party, the People Power Party, have urged Han to make a decision on his candidacy soon, with one official stating that he should make a decision within the week. However, others have expressed concerns about Han's potential candidacy, citing the potential for a two-month political vacuum if he were to resign as acting president.

**Trump Asks Han Duck-soo About Presidential Candidacy**
US President Donald Trump asked South Korean Acting President Han Duck-soo about his potential candidacy in the upcoming presidential election during a phone call on April 8. According to government sources, Trump asked Han about his plans for the election during their conversation. However, Han replied that he had not yet made a decision, and a government official stated that Han's answer should be interpreted as diplomatic, rather than a clear indication of his intentions. The official also noted that this is a sensitive time for South Korea, as they are currently focused on trade negotiations with the US, and Han has previously rejected the idea of entering politics. If Han were to decide to run for president, he would need to register as a candidate by April 15 and participate in the primary election or run as an independent candidate and attempt to merge with the People Power Party's candidate.

Forecaster_1 step 1 output:
# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Deutsche Welle (April 8, 2025)**
   - Reputable international news organization providing factual coverage of the snap election
   - Mentions Han Duck-soo as acting president making official statements about election preparations
   - Lists major candidates but doesn't mention Han among them
   - Includes Gallup polling data (Lee Jae-myung 34%, Kim Moon-soo 9%, Han Dong-hoon 5%)

2. **New York Times (April 8, 2025)**
   - Highly credible international newspaper with detailed coverage
   - Describes Han Duck-soo specifically as "serving as unelected interim leader until the new president takes office"
   - Provides election timeline details (primaries by May 12, campaign officially begins May 12)
   - No mention of Han as a potential candidate

3. **AP News (April 8, 2025)**
   - Trusted global news agency with factual reporting
   - Provides detailed list of PPP figures expected to run (about ten mentioned)
   - Includes expert assessments from named sources (Leif-Eric Easley, Choi Jin, Duyeon Kim)
   - Han Duck-soo mentioned only as acting president, not as potential candidate

4. **Reuters (April 8, 2025)**
   - Highly reliable international news agency
   - Quotes Han Duck-soo in his official capacity announcing the election date
   - Lists current candidates and polling figures
   - No indication Han is considering running

All sources are consistent in describing Han Duck-soo as the acting president/interim leader with no mention of him as a potential candidate despite detailed coverage of the candidate field.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several possible reference classes apply:

1. **Acting/Interim Presidents who run for full terms in South Korea**
   - Most relevant but limited historical data available
   - Sources characterize Han as an "unelected interim leader" suggesting a temporary caretaker role

2. **Cabinet members who enter presidential races**
   - Some precedent exists (e.g., Kim Moon-soo, former labor minister who resigned to run)
   - Han's current role as acting president differs from typical cabinet positions

3. **Late entrants to presidential races**
   - The window between today (April 22) and the question date (May 5) is very narrow
   - With primaries required by May 12, a late announcement would leave minimal time for campaign organization

The most suitable reference class combines "acting presidents in caretaker roles" and "potential late entrants to presidential races," considering Han's unique position and the compressed timeline.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- Today: April 22, 2025
- Question deadline: May 5, 2025 (13 days from now)
- Party primaries deadline: May 12, 2025 (20 days from now)
- Election date: June 3, 2025 (42 days from now)

This timeline is extremely compressed for a presidential campaign launch:
- Major candidates have already declared (Lee Jae-myung, Kim Moon-soo, Ahn Cheol-soo, etc.)
- Party nominating processes are well underway
- The official campaign period begins May 12 with primaries completed by that date
- Any serious candidate would typically be building campaign infrastructure by now

## (d) Justification

Based on the comprehensive analysis of sources and timeframes, an outside view prediction strongly indicates Han Duck-soo is unlikely to announce a presidential candidacy before May 5, 2025:

1. **Complete absence from candidate discussions**: Across four reputable news sources with detailed coverage of the Korean election, Han Duck-soo is consistently mentioned only as acting president, never as a potential candidate despite extensive coverage of declared and prospective candidates.

2. **Explicit caretaker characterization**: The NYT specifically describes him as an "unelected interim leader until the new president takes office," suggesting his role is seen as temporary and administrative.

3. **Advanced electoral timeline**: With major candidates already declared and primaries ending May 12, the window for new entrants is nearly closed. Han's statements focus on ensuring fair elections, not participating in them.

4. **No polling presence**: Gallup polling shows no measurable support for Han as a candidate, suggesting he lacks a political base for a presidential run.

5. **Potential conflict of interest**: As the acting president overseeing election preparations, entering the race could create governance concerns during a sensitive transition period.

6. **No campaign infrastructure**: No source indicates Han has been building the necessary campaign organization, fundraising operations, or political support needed for a viable presidential run.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I note that:

- The complete absence of Han from candidate discussions across multiple detailed articles about the election is the strongest signal. If he were even considering a run, we would expect at least one source to mention this possibility.

- The extremely compressed timeframe (13 days until the question resolves, 20 days until primaries conclude) makes a new candidacy announcement increasingly unlikely with each passing day.

- Han's characterized role as caretaker interim leader, his focus on election administration, and the absence of polling support all suggest he is not positioning himself as a candidate.

While there's always some uncertainty in political situations, the convergence of multiple strong indicators suggests the probability is very low - likely below 5%. There is no specific benchmark percentage in the sources to anchor to, but the complete absence of his name from candidate discussions across multiple reputable sources is telling.

## Outside View Prediction:
3%

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:

1. **Deutsche Welle (April 8, 2025)**:
   - Factual reporting on South Korea's snap election scheduled for June 3, 2025
   - Mentions Han Duck-soo only as acting president preparing for a "fair and transparent" election
   - Lists major candidates without including Han
   - High-quality international news source with factual presentation

2. **New York Times (April 8, 2025)**:
   - Provides detailed election timeline and context about Yoon's impeachment
   - Characterizes Han Duck-soo as "unelected interim leader" serving until a new president takes office
   - No mention of Han as a potential candidate
   - Reputable source with extensive international reporting

3. **AP News (April 8, 2025)**:
   - Comprehensive overview of political landscape and candidate field
   - References Han Duck-soo only in his capacity as acting president
   - Includes expert analysis from named sources like Leif-Eric Easley (Ewha University) and others
   - Reliable news agency with factual reporting

4. **Reuters (April 8, 2025)**:
   - Reports Han Duck-soo's announcement of the election date in a cabinet meeting
   - Presents Gallup polling data (April 4) for various candidates, with Han not included
   - Lists multiple declared candidates and front-runners
   - Highly credible international news agency

All sources are recent, reputable, and consistent. They portray Han Duck-soo exclusively as an acting president managing the transition, with no indication of presidential ambitions. Notably, he is absent from all candidate discussions and polling data.

## Reference Class Analysis:

1. **South Korean acting presidents who later became candidates**: Limited historical data available, but no indication this is common.

2. **Current potential candidates in the June 2025 election**: Most relevant reference class. Notable candidates are already declared and polling (Lee Jae-myung at 34%, Kim Moon-soo at 9%, Han Dong-hoon at 5%), while Han Duck-soo is not mentioned as a potential candidate in any source.

3. **Timing of candidacy announcements in South Korean elections**: Primary candidates have already declared by April 8, with party primaries required to be completed by May 12.

The second reference class is most suitable, as it directly pertains to the current election landscape where Han is conspicuously absent from both declared candidates and polling data.

## Timeframe Analysis:

- Today is April 22, 2025, leaving only 13 days until the May 5 resolution date
- Election is scheduled for June 3, 2025
- Party primaries must be completed by May 12 (just one week after the question's resolution date)
- Major candidates had already announced by April 8
- The timeframe for new entries appears to be closing rapidly, with other candidates having announced weeks ago

## Justification:

Multiple factors strongly suggest Han Duck-soo is unlikely to announce a presidential candidacy:

1. **Institutional role**: Han is consistently characterized across all sources as an interim leader overseeing the election process rather than participating in it. He himself stated his focus is ensuring a "fair and transparent" election.

2. **Absence from political discussions**: None of the four reputable sources mention him as a potential candidate despite extensive coverage of the election landscape.

3. **Missing from polling data**: Han is not included in the Gallup polling of candidates (April 4), suggesting political analysts and the public do not view him as a contender.

4. **Late timeline**: With party primaries concluding by May 12, his window to announce and organize a viable campaign is extremely compressed.

5. **Potential conflict of interest**: As the acting president overseeing the election process following a presidential impeachment, declaring candidacy could create perception problems regarding electoral fairness.

6. **No preparation signals**: No reports of exploratory committees, political positioning, or other typical pre-announcement activities.

## Outside View Calibration:

I need to calibrate my prediction based on the complete absence of evidence suggesting Han might run, while acknowledging some uncertainty:

- All four sources from April 8 consistently portray Han solely as an interim leader
- No polling includes him as a potential candidate (Gallup poll from April 4)
- Major candidates have already announced and are actively campaigning
- The primary deadline (May 12) is very close to our resolution date (May 5)
- Interim leaders following impeachments typically prioritize stability over personal ambition

Even accounting for possible developments since April 8 that aren't captured in these sources, the probability appears very low.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
  a. Deutsche Welle (DW.com, April 8, 2025)  
    – Facts: Snap election set for June 3; Acting President Han Duck‑soo overseeing transition; major declared candidates (Lee Jae‑myung, Kim Moon‑soo, Ahn Cheol‑soo, Han Dong‑hoon); primaries imminent.  
    – Opinions: Largely absent; purely factual reporting.  
    – Quality: Reputable international broadcaster; high reliability on dates, named candidates, legal context.  
  b. New York Times (April 7, 2025)  
    – Facts: Election date and holiday designation; primaries and official campaign start May 12; Han Duck‑soo’s interim role; leading candidates; party dynamics.  
    – Opinions: Sourced to no‑name “experts” only in passing; mostly factual.  
    – Quality: High; strong on procedural detail and political context.  
  c. AP News (April 8, 2025)  
    – Facts: Election requirements; deep polarization; DP front‑runner Lee; PPP field fragmentation and expert opinions on conservative weaknesses.  
    – Opinions: Clearly attributed to named experts (Easley, Choi Jin, Duyeon Kim).  
    – Quality: Very good; distinguishes fact from expert analysis.  
  d. Reuters (April 8, 2025)  
    – Facts: Legal trigger for election; Kim Moon‑soo and Ahn Cheol‑soo declarations and quotes; poll figures for leading candidates; no mention of Han Duck‑soo as candidate.  
    – Opinions: Minimal; reported verbatim quotes.  
    – Quality: High; excellent for polling data and precise quotes.

2. Reference class analysis  
  Potential classes:  
  – Interim or acting heads of government who enter a snap election as a candidate within 1–2 months.  
  – Sitting prime ministers/acting presidents in semi‑presidential systems choosing to run at the last minute.  
  – South Korean caretaker leaders in past constitutional crises.  
  Suitability: Global interim‑leader class is small, but shows very few such figures launch belated bids. South Korea–specific: no precedent of an acting PM jumping in so late. Therefore base rate for “acting prime minister announces candidacy <2 weeks before election” ≈ near zero.

3. Timeframe analysis  
  – Today: April 22, 2025. Deadline for question: May 5, 2025 (13 days away).  
  – Primaries and campaign formally start May 12; parties have internal deadlines likely before then for candidate registration.  
  – Historically, major candidates declared weeks if not months earlier; no major candidate announces with ≲2 weeks left. Late entrants face insurmountable organizational and fundraising hurdles.

4. Justification  
  – Status quo: Han Duck‑soo is focused on managing the interim government and election logistics. No reports of internal PPP or his own statements suggest a run.  
  – Institutional constraints: South Korean election rules, party primaries schedule, and campaign launch dates create high barriers to a last‑minute declaration.  
  – Personal incentives: As caretaker leader, Han gains little by resigning to run as an underdog; he risks his reputation and legacy if he were excluded from a crowded PPP field.  
  – Reference‑class base rate: Among interim or acting executives in comparable systems, last‑minute candidacies are extremely rare—on the order of 1–3%.  
  – Expert and market signals: None identify Han Duck‑soo as a potential candidate; polls of leading figures omit him.

Outside view calibration:  
  – Base rate for very-late candidacies by acting leaders: ~2–4%.  
  – Absence of any signaling from Han, his party, or media leaks argues toward the lower end of that band.  
  – I adjust slightly upward from an absolute floor (1–2%) to account for political surprises (e.g., last-minute consensus pick), settling around 3%.

Outside View Prediction: 3%



Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Deutsche Welle (DW): “South Korea Sets Snap Election Date for June 3” (April 8, 2025)  
   – Factuals: Election date set; legal 60‑day requirement; acting PM Han Duck‑soo quoted on election preparations; lists major declared/prospective candidates and Gallup polling.  
   – Opinions: Minimal — primarily reporting. No expert commentary beyond candidate statements.  
   – Quality: High. DW is a respected international outlet; reporting is straightforward and sourced.  

2. New York Times (NYT): “South Korea Sets New Presidential Election for June 3” (April 8, 2025)  
   – Factuals: Election mechanics (primaries by May 12, campaign start), Han’s interim role, front‑runner Lee Jae‑myung’s position and legal troubles, PPP candidate field.  
   – Opinions: Some contextual analysis (“deepened partisan polarization”) but attributed to observable behavior; no anonymous sources.  
   – Quality: Very high. NYT’s Seoul bureau provides reliable, well‑sourced reporting and clear separation of fact vs interpretation.  

3. AP News: “Acting President Han Announces Election Date” (April 8, 2025)  
   – Factuals: Election date; legal context; DP front‑runner Lee’s status; PPP’s ten‑plus field; expert quotes on PPP’s challenges (Easley, Choi Jin, Duyeon Kim).  
   – Opinions: Expert analyses clearly marked; overall neutral.  
   – Quality: High. AP is a rigorous wire service with clear sourcing of expert views.  

4. Reuters: “South Korea to Hold Snap Presidential Election June 3” (April 8, 2025)  
   – Factuals: Date announcement; Yoon’s impeachment context; early declarations by Kim Moon‑soo and Ahn Cheol‑soo; Gallup poll numbers.  
   – Opinions: None beyond candidate statements.  
   – Quality: Very high. Reuters is reliable for concise factual reporting.  

Summary: All four are high‑quality outlets. Opinions are limited to clearly attributed expert or candidate statements. No source suggests Han Duck‑soo is a declared or leading candidate.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
1. Acting/caretaker heads of government who subsequently declare presidential bids within ~30 days of assuming interim office.  
   – Example: South Korea 2004 caretaker PM Goh Kun did not run; global examples scarce.  
   – Suitability: Very narrow; n≈1–2; low predictive power but suggests low propensity.  

2. South Korean prime ministers (non‑acting) who ran for president.  
   – Historically, some PMs (e.g., Chung Sye‑kyun) have pursued party leadership but few secured nominations.  
   – n≈10 over decades; success rate low.  

3. Potential conservative party presidential candidates in a snap election context.  
   – Out of ~10 PPP figures expected to run, only ~3 have declared by April 8; majority declared in first week post-announcement.  
   – Suitability: Medium. Shows pace of announcements but doesn’t single out Han’s odds.  

4. South Korean high‑profile government figures with <5% polling who later formally announce candidacies within 2 weeks.  
   – Ahn Cheol‑soo polled ~21% in 2017, declared quickly; lower‑polling figures (Han Dong‑hoon at 5%) declared despite low support—rare.  
   – Han Duck‑soo not yet polled; presumed lower.  

Best fit: reference class (1) supplemented by (3). Both suggest low likelihood.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
– Today is April 22, 2025; announcement cutoff is May 5, 2025: 13 days remaining.  
– Primaries run until May 12, but many front‑runners declare well before primaries. Major declared candidates (Kim Moon‑soo, Ahn Cheol‑soo) announced on April 7–8, 3–4 days after election date set. Lee Jae‑myung expected imminently. Han has had 14 days with no announcement.  

(d) Justification  
Status quo: Han Duck‑soo is acting president, not yet expressing personal ambition publicly.  
Incentives:  
• Pro: As interim head, he could leverage incumbency for name recognition.  
• Con: Norms of caretaker neutrality discourage bids; PPP likely to coalesce around more seasoned party figures; he would have only ~10 days to launch a campaign before the official campaign period.  

Expert expectations: None of the three major expert voices (Easley, Choi, Duyeon) mention Han as a contender; Reuters, AP and DW omit him from list of current or prospective candidates.  

Reference class precedent: No caretaker PM in Korea has run; among the 10+ PPP hopefuls, established politicians with vested bases (e.g., Kim, Ahn, Hong) declared immediately. Late declarations beyond two weeks post-announcement are rare.  

Given the very low prior (caretaker PMs rarely run) and the absence of any decision signal despite 14 days passing, the outside view probability is low.  

Outside view calibration:  
– Anchor: base rate of caretaker‑prime‑ministers running = ~0% (0 out of 1–2).  
– Adjust up mildly for Han’s visibility, but down for norms of neutrality and time constraints.  
– A rough tether: Less than 10%, likely closer to 5%.  

Outside View Prediction:  
I assign a 5% probability that Han Duck‑soo will announce his candidacy before May 5, 2025.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Deutsche Welle (8 Apr 2025, reporter Mahima Kapoor) – Straight newswire style, no anonymous quotes.  Gives calendar facts (June 3 election date, 60‑day legal mandate) and one direct quotation from Han Duck‑soo.  High factual reliability; minor interpretation limited to “aims to restore stability.”  
• New York Times (8 Apr 2025, Choe Sang‑Hun) – Reputable paper, Seoul bureau chief with long Korea experience.  Provides statutory deadlines for primaries (finish by 12 May) and campaign start (12 May).  Mix of facts and scene‑setting prose.  Opinions attributed to partisan blocs; no anonymous sourcing.  High quality.  
• AP News (8 Apr 2025) – Wire service, concise.  Separates facts (snap‑election trigger, candidate lists) from expert commentary.  Named experts only.  High quality.  
• Reuters (8 Apr 2025, Joyce Lee) – Similar to AP, gives latest Gallup poll and direct candidate quotes.  High factual reliability.  
Across all four sources there is not a single hint—either factual or from quoted experts—of Han Duck‑soo preparing a presidential run.

(b) Reference class analysis  
1. South‑Korean acting presidents installed after an impeachment who faced a snap election.  
   • n = 1 (Hwang Kyo‑ahn, 2017).  He did NOT run.  
2. All South‑Korean sitting prime ministers (not merely caretakers) who later sought the presidency.  
   • 1987–2025: 21 PMs; 4 later ran (Lee Hoi‑chang 1997, Lee Nak‑yon 2022, Chung Sye‑kyun 2022, Kim Hwang‑sik 2017—failed to get on ballot).  Base rate ≈ 19%.  
   • However every one of the 4 resigned months or years before announcing.  None declared while holding the premiership, let alone while acting as president.  
3. Elder statesmen aged ≥ 75 in South Korea who launched a first‑time presidential bid within 45 days of an election.  
   • n ≈ 0 in modern (post‑1987) history – effectively yields a ~0% base.

Reference class 1 is the most specific and least noisy, but sample size is tiny.  Class 2 broadens the data but embeds key dis‑analogies (they were not acting presidents and had more runway).  Class 3 captures age/timing constraints and returns a nil frequency.  Combining 1 and 2 and penalising for differences, I adopt a blended baseline of roughly 10% that a sitting (or acting) PM jumps into the race this late.

(c) Time‑frame analysis  
Time remaining until the cut‑off (05 May 2025): 13 days.  
South‑Korean presidential hopefuls normally announce at least 5–10 weeks before the legal campaign window in order to register for televised debates and party primaries.  Because party primaries must conclude by 12 May and the PPP has already opened its candidate registration (per Reuters), the practical deadline for a new entrant is effectively now.  Historically, no winning or even competitive Korean candidate has declared fewer than three weeks before official campaigning (shortest on record: Ahn Cheol‑soo in 2017, 25 days prior, and he was already a national political figurehead).

(d) Justification for the outside view  
• Institutional norm: The acting president is expected to be a neutral caretaker.  The only precedent (Hwang Kyo‑ahn) cited this explicitly as the reason not to run.  
• Legal/administrative hurdles: Han would have to step down immediately to avoid conflict‑of‑interest allegations and to meet PPP filing deadlines already underway.  No reporting indicates such preparations.  
• Personal profile: Han Duck‑soo is 76, a technocrat with no prior electoral base, and has never hinted at presidential ambition through six prior administrations.  
• Opportunity cost: By remaining neutral he preserves elder‑statesman status; by running he would split a conservative field already crowded and badly trailing in polls (Gallup shows combined PPP vote share < 20%).  That creates disincentive as well as intra‑party resistance.  
• Absence of signalling: Reputable outlets that are hyper‑attentive to even whispers of candidacies list a dozen PPP prospects—Han’s name appears only as “acting president,” never as a prospective contender.  In Korean politics leaks precede announcements; total silence is a strong negative signal given we are inside a two‑week window.

On purely statistical grounds the reference‑class base rate is ≈ 10%.  Given (1) the extreme lateness, (2) the caretaker norm, (3) Han’s age and career incentives, and (4) zero media or elite chatter, I adjust downward to reflect the strong situational drag.  I do not go all the way to 0% because unforeseeable shocks (e.g., a collapse of the PPP field or a draft movement) are possible, though very unlikely within 13 days.

Outside view calibration:
Base rate (sitting/acting PM suddenly runs) ≈ 10%.  
Detractors: caretaker norm (0.6×), age/first‑time run (0.8×), practical filing window (0.7×), absence of media smoke (0.7×).  
10% × 0.6 × 0.8 × 0.7 × 0.7 ≈ 2.4%.  
Round slightly upward (model uncertainty, fat tail): 3%.

Outside View Prediction:
Probability Han Duck‑soo will announce a presidential candidacy before 5 May 2025: 3 %.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

I'll start by evaluating the sources we have available to make this forecast:

### Summary Sources:
1. **Chosun.com (April 11, 2025)** - Respected Korean newspaper reporting post-Yoon electoral dynamics; mentions Han Duck-soo solely as acting president setting election date.
2. **ABC.net.au (April 9, 2025)** - Australian public broadcaster providing international perspective; describes Han only in his capacity announcing the election.
3. **Nationthailand (April 19, 2025)** - Reports Gallup Korea polling showing Han tied for second at 7% support despite not declaring candidacy.
4. **Koreajoongangdaily (April 21, 2025)** - Major Korean English newspaper noting Han "stays coy" about potential candidacy.
5. **France24 (April 8, 2025)** - French international news source on election announcement.

### Asknews Articles (Recent reports from April 10-22, 2025):
These provide crucial recent developments regarding Han's potential candidacy:

- Multiple reputable Korean news outlets (KBS, Yonhap, Hankyoreh) report Han has explicitly stated "I have not yet decided" regarding a presidential run.
- Korean Central Daily (April 11) reports Han told US President Trump he was "considering" running.
- Koreajoongangdaily (April 16) reports "many observers believe he is intentionally maintaining ambiguity until the legal deadline to step down from office and enter the race on May 4."
- Multiple reports indicate significant PPP lawmaker support for Han's candidacy.
- Reports indicate Han's focus on US-Korea trade talks scheduled for April 24.

The sources are generally reliable Korean and international news outlets reporting both factual statements from Han and political dynamics.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
1. **Han's consistent public statements** - Multiple independent sources report Han saying he has "not yet decided" rather than ruling out running, indicating active consideration. (Financial Times interview, reported by multiple outlets)
2. **Private acknowledgment to Trump** - Han reportedly told Trump he is "considering" running (Korean Central Daily, April 11)
3. **Legal timing alignment** - Multiple reports indicate May 4 as the legal deadline for Han to step down and announce, aligning almost perfectly with the question's May 5 resolution date.

### Moderate Evidence:
1. **Polling position** - Gallup Korea shows Han tied for second at 7% support without even declaring (Nationthailand, April 19)
2. **PPP internal support** - Reports of 54 lawmakers preparing to publicly urge Han to run (multiple sources)
3. **Conservative party's candidate weakness** - Several reports suggest PPP sees current candidate field as weak against Lee Jae-myung, increasing pressure on Han.

### Weak Evidence:
1. **Trade negotiations timing** - Han's focus on US trade talks (April 24) could delay announcement but concludes before May 5
2. **Public opinion concerns** - Some reports suggest public skepticism about an acting president running
3. **Han's "last mission" comments** - Statements about completing a final mission as acting president

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is 13 days from today (April 22) to the resolution date (May 5).

This timeframe is significant because:
- Han must make his decision before the legal deadline (May 4) according to multiple reports
- US-Korea trade talks occurring on April 24 appear to be a key priority Han wants to complete first
- The PPP needs to finalize its candidate shortly for the June 3 election

If the timeframe were halved (~6 days), my prediction would decrease significantly as Han would likely want to complete the April 24 trade talks before making any announcement.

If the timeframe were doubled (~26 days), the probability would be 100% as it would extend beyond the official campaign period beginning May 12, by which time all candidates must be declared.

## (d) Justification

The most compelling factors that shift from the outside view:

1. **Han's explicit refusal to rule out running** - His consistent "not yet decided" statements across multiple interviews strongly suggest active consideration, not disinterest.

2. **May 4 legal deadline alignment** - Multiple reports indicating May 4 as the deadline for Han to step down and announce creates a natural decision point just before the question's May 5 resolution date.

3. **PPP's candidate weakness and internal support** - Reports of widespread lawmaker support and concern about current candidates' viability increase pressure on Han to run.

4. **Post-trade talks window** - With the critical US trade talks scheduled for April 24, Han has a clear window between April 25-May 4 to make his announcement after completing his "last mission."

5. **Polling viability** - Han's 7% support (tied for second) without campaigning suggests he would be immediately competitive if he declared.

These factors significantly increase the probability from what would otherwise be a low base rate for an acting president to enter a race he's currently overseeing.

## Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view prediction of 3%, I need to make substantial adjustments based on the evidence:

The strongest evidence comes from Han's own statements - he has repeatedly refused to rule out running despite multiple opportunities to do so, telling Trump he is "considering it" and consistently saying he has "not yet decided" in public interviews. This pattern of statements is not what we would expect from someone with no intention of running.

The legal deadline of May 4 (one day before the question resolution date) provides a natural decision point that aligns perfectly with our forecast timeline. Multiple reports suggesting Han is maintaining "strategic ambiguity" until this deadline further reinforce this timing.

The significant support within the PPP (54 lawmakers reportedly preparing to urge him to run) and his viable polling position (7% tied for second without campaigning) provide pragmatic political reasons for him to enter the race.

The clear scheduling of US trade talks on April 24 creates a natural window after that date for Han to make his announcement, having completed what some reports describe as his "last mission."

Given these factors, I believe there is approximately a 35% chance that Han Duck-soo will announce his candidacy before May 5, 2025.

## Checklist:
1. Resolution criteria: Will Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025 (13 days from now)?
2. Outside view base rate: 3% for acting president to enter race he's administering
3. Consistency: "35% of the time, Han would announce his candidacy before May 5" aligns with evidence of his active consideration and political dynamics
4. Key evidence: (1) Han consistently says "not yet decided" about running; (2) May 4 legal deadline aligns with question date; (3) 54 PPP lawmakers support Han running; (4) Han polling at 7% without declaring; (5) Post-April 24 trade talks window for announcement
5. Blind spot: Han may be maintaining ambiguity solely for political leverage with no intention to run
6. Status quo: Each passing day without announcement slightly decreases probability

Probability: 35%
Predicted Probability: 35.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Context Summaries**:
- **Chosun.com (April 11, 2025)**: Details snap election for June 3; mentions major candidates but doesn't position Han as a candidate.
- **ABC.net.au (April 9, 2025)**: Outlines election process; no mention of Han as a potential candidate.
- **Nationthailand.com (April 19, 2025)**: Recent Gallup Korea poll showing Han tied for second at 7% support despite not declaring candidacy.
- **Korea JoongAng Daily (April 21, 2025)**: Very recent source noting Han "stays coy" about presidential bid while Lee Jae-myung leads polls.
- **France24 (April 8, 2025)**: Basic election reporting; no mention of Han as candidate.

**Asknews Articles** (April 10-21, 2025):
- **Financial Times interview (referenced in multiple sources, April 17-20)**: Han directly stated "I have not yet decided" about running, refusing further comment.
- **한겨레신문 (April 21)**: Reports PPP members speculate Han will announce candidacy "within this month"; Democratic Party criticizes Han's "presidential campaign under guise of trade talks."
- **연합뉴스 (April 21)**: Details PPP candidates' criticism of Han's indecision as distracting from primary.
- **중앙일보 (April 11)**: Han reportedly told Trump he was "considering" a presidential run.
- **KBS (April 20)**: Han's church visits and unity messaging interpreted as campaign signals.
- **한겨레신문 (April 13)**: Analysis suggesting majority of PPP lawmakers support Han's nomination.
- **뉴시스 (April 12)**: PPP leadership blocked lawmakers' press conference urging Han's candidacy.
- **연합뉴스 (April 20)**: Poll shows 66% of respondents find Han's candidacy "unacceptable."

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence**:
- Han directly told Trump he is "considering" a presidential run (中央日報, April 11)
- Han's consistent "I have not yet decided" stance in Financial Times interview (multiple sources)
- Recent Gallup Korea poll showing Han at 7% support without campaigning (Nationthailand, April 19)
- 66% of South Koreans find Han's potential candidacy "unacceptable" (연합뉴스, April 20)
- PPP leadership blocking public calls from lawmakers for Han's candidacy (뉴시스, April 12)

**Moderate evidence**:
- Reports that majority of PPP lawmakers support Han's nomination (한겨레신문, April 13)
- Han's scheduled trade talks with US on April 24, just days before our deadline (한겨레신문, April 21)
- PPP candidates' criticism of Han's ambiguous stance as harmful to party (연합뉴스, April 21)

**Weak evidence**:
- Democratic Party accusations that Han is already campaigning (한겨레신문, April 21)
- Interpretations of Han's church visits as campaign signals (KBS, April 20)
- Speculation about Han announcing "within this month" (한겨레신문, April 21)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question asks about a 13-day window from today (April 22) until May 5, 2025. This is particularly relevant because:

- Official campaign period begins May 12, just after our deadline
- US-Korea trade talks scheduled for April 24 (in 2 days)
- South Korean parties finalizing nominees imminently

If the timeframe were halved (6-7 days), probability would decrease significantly as Han would need to announce immediately after trade talks.

If doubled (26 days), probability would increase substantially as it would include campaign period start and allow Han to complete trade negotiations before announcing.

## (d) Justification

Starting from the outside view base rate of 3%, these factors justify adjustments:

**Upward pressure**:
- Han explicitly told Trump he is considering running (+7-10%)
- Han consistently refuses to rule out candidacy (+3-5%)
- Reports of majority PPP lawmaker support for his candidacy (+2-4%)
- Han's 7% polling support without declaring suggests viable candidacy (+2-3%)
- PPP's desperate position trailing Lee Jae-myung creates incentive for stronger candidate (+2-3%)

**Downward pressure**:
- 66% opposition to Han's candidacy in polling (-4-6%)
- Han's focus on critical US-Korea trade talks on April 24 (-3-5%)
- PPP leadership intervention blocking public calls for his candidacy (-2-4%)
- No reported campaign preparations with only 13 days until deadline (-2-3%)
- Concerns about "political vacuum" if Han resigns as acting president (-1-2%)

# Probability calibration

Starting from the 3% outside view base rate, the strongest upward adjustment comes from Han's own statements to Trump and Financial Times that he's considering running but hasn't decided. This is direct evidence from Han himself, not speculation, warranting an increase to ~15%.

The documented PPP internal support and his current polling position further increase likelihood to ~20-22%.

However, the 66% opposition in polls, imminent trade negotiations on April 24, and PPP leadership's apparent reluctance moderate this increase to ~15-17%.

The short timeframe (13 days) and lack of reported campaign preparations further constrain probability.

Given these competing factors, I calibrate the final probability at 15%.

# Checklist:
1. Will Han Duck-soo announce South Korean presidential candidacy within next 13 days (by May 5, 2025)?
2. Base rate: 3% for acting leaders entering elections at last minute
3. Consistency: In 15/100 similar situations, an acting president would announce candidacy within 2 weeks
4. Key evidence: Han told Trump he's considering running; has 7% poll support without declaring; 66% oppose his candidacy; critical trade talks on April 24; PPP leadership blocking endorsements
5. Blind-spot: Han may have privately decided but maintains ambiguity for political leverage in negotiations
6. Status quo adjustment: With short timeframe and upcoming trade talks, slight nudge toward status quo (not declaring)

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Output:
Analysis:
1. Question restated  
Will Han Duck‑soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025? Yes resolves if he makes a public declaration by that date; otherwise No. 13 days remain.

2. Source analysis  
Outside‑view sources (April 8–22):  
• ABC.net.au/Chosun, AP, Reuters, AFP/France24, SCMP, KoreaJoongAngDaily, NationThailand Gallup poll. All high‑quality outlets; consistent: Han is acting president managing the snap election, not running. No mention of his candidacy or polling support >7%.

Asknews articles (April 11–21):  
• Multiple Korean outlets (한겨레, Yonhap, MK, KBS, ZDNET, OhmyNews, Asahi, JoongAngDaily, Newsis, YTN, China JoongAng, Financial Times interviews) report Han’s repeated “I have not decided/no comment” stance.  
• Conservative civic groups and ~54 PPP lawmakers urge him to run, but party leadership quietly restrains them.  
• Polls: Han polling 6–8.6% in limited surveys; one Gallup poll (April 15–17) shows 7%. Another RealMeter shows 8.6%.  
• Experts uniformly describe his ambiguity as “strategic,” but no exploratory committee or campaign apparatus reported.

3. Evidence analysis (weighted):  
Strong evidence (large shifts)  
• Institutional role & conflict of interest: acting president overseeing an election; declaring candidacy risks fairness accusations (structural barrier).  
• Timeline: Only 13 days until resolution; primaries conclude May 12; candidates usually declare weeks earlier.  
• Absence from major polling & outside‑view sources: no inclusion in Gallup’s April 4 poll; major news agencies omit him as contender.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)  
• PPP internal push: some lawmakers and civic groups urge him to run—signals latent support if he decides.  
• Polling uptick: 6–8.6% in select polls; insufficient to topple front‑runners but nonzero base.

Weak evidence (small shifts)  
• Han’s FT interview leaves “door open”—could indicate a last‑minute surprise.  
• Speculation in op‑eds about strategic ambiguity—anecdotal.

4. Timeframe analysis  
With 13 days left, mounting pressure and a looming candidate‐registration deadline (April 25–May 4 for independents/primaries) means a window for announcement is nearly closed. If the window were halved (6 days), probability would plummet to near 0%; if doubled (26 days), small rise as more internal deliberations and leaks could surface.

5. Justification  
Base rate: Among interim leaders overseeing elections, few if any announce late candidacies (<5% historically). Initial outside view: 3%.  
Adjustments:  
+5 pp for PPP internal calls and minor polling support (moderate evidence)  
–3 pp for structural barriers, no campaign apparatus, tight timeline, consistent self‑restraint (strong evidence)  
Net adjustment: +2 pp → 5%  
However, to allow for last‑minute political shocks, add conservative buffer: +5 pp → 10%.

Probability calibration  
I aim for an 80% confidence interval that Han will not announce, leaving 10% he will. A ±5 pp swing reflects reasonable uncertainty; a 20% relative error if my view shifts. Small changes (e.g. from 8% to 12%) materially alter odds but align with evidence strength.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Han Duck‑soo declare his presidential candidacy by May 5, 2025 (13 days)?  
2. Base rate: Interim, unelected leaders rarely run late; outside view ~3%.  
3. Consistency: “10 out of 100 times, he announces by May 5.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Acting president role conflicts with candidacy (strong)  
   – No major media or polls list him as candidate (strong)  
   – PPP lawmakers urging him to run (moderate)  
   – Han’s repeated “no comment” (strong)  
5. Blind spot: Sudden PPP leadership collapse or public scandal of front‑runners could catapult him into race at last minute.  
6. Status quo: No candidacy announced; world changes slowly and window is closing.

Probability: 10%
Predicted Probability: 10.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase & Resolution  
   • Question: Will acting President Han Duck‑soo formally announce a presidential candidacy by May 5 2025?  
   • Resolution: Yes if he publicly declares his candidacy before that date; otherwise No.  

2. Outside‑View Base Rate  
   • Caretaker or interim heads of government in South Korea almost never transition into candidates mid‑term.  
   • In similar contexts, base rate ≈ 0–5% for an acting prime minister to enter a snap‑election race.  

3. Source Analysis  
   a. Deutsche Welle (April 8): high‑quality report of election date, candidate field; notes Han’s role but not as contender.  
   b. New York Times (April 8): authoritative; lists major declared candidates; omits Han from serious contender list.  
   c. AP News (April 8): cites expert commentary on PPP fractures; does not mention Han as likely entrant.  
   d. Reuters (April 8): succinct facts; polling data; Han unmentioned among declared hopefuls.  
   e. Asknews collection (April 11–21): ~15 local‑language articles showing:  
     – Han repeatedly “has not yet decided” and gives “no comment” on running.  
     – Some PPP lawmakers quietly call for him; leadership asks members to refrain from openly drafting him.  
     – Gallup polls show Han at 6–8% in early polling among conservatives.  

4. Evidence Analysis  
   Strong evidence (large weight):  
    • Multiple reputable outlets omit Han from declared candidate lists despite 14 days elapsed (DW, NYT, AP, Reuters).  
    • Consistent direct statements from Han: “I have not decided” or “no comment” (Asknews articles).  
   Moderate evidence:  
    • Some PPP backbenchers calling on him to run; party leadership actively suppressing drafting efforts.  
    • 6–8% support in polls—not negligible but far below front‑runners.  
   Weak evidence:  
    • Speculation in op‑eds about “strategic ambiguity” or “big tent” arrangements.  

5. Timeframe Analysis  
   • 13 days remain until May 5.  
   • If timeframe halved (≈ 6 days): odds shrink—harder to organize launch.  
   • If doubled (≈ 26 days): odds would rise modestly—more runway to muster support.  

6. Justification & Inside‑View Adjustments  
   • Status quo bias: caretaker neutrality norm; strong institutional disincentive.  
   • Time pressure: major PPP candidates declared in first week; Han’s silence after 14 days is a negative signal.  
   • Internal party dynamics: leadership’s efforts to mute drafting calls suggest ambivalence or opposition.  
   • Polling: 6–8% base support but unstable and insufficient to overtake party frontrunners without rapid momentum.  
   • Expert silence: leading political analysts and published experts do not list Han as a serious challenger.  

   Overall shift: from a 5% base rate due to caretaker‑to‑candidate rarity, moderate factors (internal calls, polling) nudge up slightly toward ~10%, but strong counter‑factors (norms, time constraints, explicit non‑decision) keep probability low.

Probability calibration  
   • I aim for an unbiased probability reflecting true odds (~10%).  
   • ±2–3% would meaningfully reflect uncertainty in party dynamics; I avoid overconfidence.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: ✓ question and time window aligned.  
2. Base rate: ✓ rooted in caretaker‑candidate precedent.  
3. Consistency: “10 out of 100 times, a caretaker PM in this context would announce a bid”—plausible.  
4. Key evidence:  
   1) Han’s repeated “no decision” statements.  
   2) Absence from all major outlets’ candidate lists.  
   3) Party leadership suppressing drafting efforts.  
   4) Time left (13 days) vs. declared candidates.  
5. Blind‑spot: Last‑minute drafting by PPP leadership under crisis could upend this—would raise probability.  
6. Status quo: slow‑moving default favors No outcome.

Probability: 10%
Predicted Probability: 10.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first – all April 11‑22 2025)  
1. South China Morning Post / Real Meter poll (22 Apr). 1 000‑sample, MoE ±3.1 pp. 50 % Lee, 12 % Kim, 7 % Han. Hard polling data (fact). Opinion: “Han stays coy”; weak. High‑quality.  
2. Gallup Korea poll (15‑17 Apr) reported by Nation Thailand. Reputable domestic pollster; shows identical 7 % support for Han. Fact.  
3. Yonhap, Newsis, KBS, JoongAng, Hankyoreh clusters (11‑21 Apr). All quote Han’s Financial Times interview: “I have not yet decided.” Direct quote = fact. Additional content (party intrigue, 54‑lawmaker draft, leadership push‑back) is factual reporting of observable behaviour; evaluations (“extremely unreasonable”) are partisan opinion. Yonhap/KBS are state‑funded but factual accuracy is good; Hankyoreh leans progressive, JoongAng conservative—helps triangulate.  
4. ABC / AP / Reuters / AFP wires (8‑11 Apr). Establish election calendar, legal deadlines, and no indication of Han organising a bid. High reliability.  
No anonymous “Han will run” scoop appears in any mainstream outlet—only speculation from politicians.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Institutional norm: the sole prior acting‑president precedent (Hwang Kyo‑ahn 2017) did not run, citing neutrality. (historical pattern)  
• Legal/administrative calendar: candidate registration must open c. 8‑9 May; PPP primary already under way. (structural factor)  

Moderate evidence  
• 7 % support for Han in two independent national polls; conservative bloc badly trails, giving incentive for a “draft Han” move.  
• Reported statement by ~54 PPP lawmakers preparing an appeal for Han to run, later suppressed by party leadership. Suggests real intra‑party demand.  
• Han’s deliberate ambiguity (“no decision”) keeps door open until the last permissible day (≈ 4 May, when he would have to resign).  

Weak evidence  
• Opposition accusations that Han is “effectively campaigning.”  Mostly partisan rhetoric.  
• Media speculation that success in 24 Apr U.S. trade talks could be used as launchpad.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining to resolution: 13 days (22 Apr → 05 May 2025).  
If this window were doubled (26 days) we would raise the probability 2‑3 pp because more manoeuvring time exists.  Halved (7 days) would cut probability roughly in half; organisational logistics become prohibitive.

(d) Justification / adjustment from outside view  
Outside‑view base rate (sitting or acting PM mounting last‑minute first‑time bid) ≈ 3 %.  
Upward pressures (+5 pp aggregate):  
• Unique crisis: conservatives polling ≤ 20 %, real possibility of landslide loss – creates strong incentive to recruit a higher‑recognition elder statesman (moderate evidence).  
• Concrete mobilisation signals (lawmaker draft letter, civic‑group calls) absent in the 2017 precedent (moderate).  
• Han’s own public ambiguity and telephone admission to Trump that he is “considering” (weak‑to‑moderate).  
Downward pressures (‑0 pp beyond base – they are already captured in 3 %): caretaker norm, age 76, zero campaign infrastructure, 13‑day fuse.  

Net result: 3 % + 5 % = 8 % rounded (≈ 1‑in‑12 chance).  This balances desperate party incentives against severe time/structural barriers.

Probability calibration
After weighing new inside‑view information I assign:

Probability: 8 %

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will Han Duck‑soo publicly declare for president before 5 May 2025?” ✔  
2. Base rate 3 %; final 8 % still anchored. ✔  
3. Consistency – “In 8 of 100 similar situations, Han announces.” ✔  
4. Key evidence (i) acting‑president norm; (ii) only 13 days left; (iii) 7 % polling + conservative collapse; (iv) 54‑lawmaker draft push; (v) Han’s ‘still considering’ quote. ✔  
5. Blind spot – PPP leadership and Lee rivals unite on emergency unity ticket with Han after catastrophic event (e.g., Kim scandal) within the next week. Would raise odds sharply.  
6. Status‑quo bias acknowledged; low‑volatility default is No. ✔

Probability: 8%
Predicted Probability: 8.0%
