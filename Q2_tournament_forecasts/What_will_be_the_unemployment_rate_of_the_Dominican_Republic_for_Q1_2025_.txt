Analysis:
The key to forecasting Q1 2025 unemployment in the Dominican Republic is establishing a solid outside-view baseline using historical quarterly data, and then considering near-term drivers like U.S. tariffs and regional employment momentum. Historically, DR’s unemployment peaked in 2020 (COVID shock) above 15%, then steadily declined to around 5–6% by 2023–24. The status quo projection (if trends continue) is a slight further decline or stabilization near 5%. However, warned U.S. tariffs could slow export-led growth in 2025, while ECLAC highlights DR’s strong Latino employment gains. To build the baseline, we need precise quarterly series (Q1 values from 2010 through 2024) from Trading Economics or similar. Then we’ll adjust for potential headwinds (tariff impact on manufacturing and tourism spillovers) and momentum (ongoing investment in nearshoring).

Analysis:
To forecast Q1 2025 unemployment in the Dominican Republic, I need recent data and expert commentary on factors likely to shift labor markets. Key drivers include potential US tariffs (per Economist Ciriaco’s warning), ECLAC’s reports on regional employment growth, domestic GDP growth projections, and government or central bank labor statistics. I will look for updates on tariff negotiations, ECLAC or IMF forecasts, recent national employment surveys, and any commentary from Dominican authorities projecting labor conditions in 2025.

Here’s a concise summary of NBC News’ April 9, 2025 “Morning Rundown” article:

1. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs take effect  
   • President Trump’s sweeping import tariffs—averaging 29% and reaching 40% for many countries, with Chinese goods facing a 104% cumulative rate—went into force overnight.  
   • U.S. equities reversed an early rally, closing down for a fourth straight day. Since Trump’s inauguration, the S&P 500 is off 17% and the Nasdaq 22%.  
   • The administration’s aim is to curb reliance on foreign goods and shrink the trade deficit. Many economists warn this could raise consumer prices and slow growth. Wells Fargo analysts predict the U.S. unemployment rate could climb from 4% to 5%.

2. IRS acting commissioner resigns over ICE data-sharing deal  
   • Melanie Krause, who’d served as acting IRS commissioner since February, is resigning over a newly revealed agreement to share undocumented immigrants’ tax information with ICE.  
   • According to two people familiar with the decision, the arrangement—announced in a court filing—marks a sharp break from longstanding IRS practice and hinges on a legal exception for suspected criminal violations.

3. Deadly nightclub roof collapse in the Dominican Republic  
   • At least 113 people died and 155 were hospitalized when the roof of the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo collapsed during a performance by merengue singer Rubby Pérez (who later died of his injuries).  
   • Other victims included former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel and left fielder Tony Blanco, as well as Montecristi governor Nelsy Cruz. Club owners say they are cooperating with authorities but the cause of the collapse remains under investigation.

4. Fort Knox gold-reserve conspiracy resurfaces  
   • President Trump and Elon Musk have cast doubt on whether the U.S. gold at Fort Knox actually exists, reviving a 1970s–era conspiracy theory.  
   • Though they’ve hinted at a presidential visit, no trip has been scheduled. NBC spoke with experts and visitors to Fort Knox to explain what’s really stored there.

Key facts and projections:
1. Tariff scenario
   • 10% across-the-board tariffs on China; 25% blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico  
   • Reduced 10% rate for Canadian oil/energy and less proportional Canadian retaliation make this scenario milder than Oxford’s prior tariff shock case  
   • Exemptions expected for building materials and transportation equipment  

2. Macroeconomic impacts (versus Oxford’s January baseline)
   • US GDP growth shaved by 0.7 percentage points in 2025  
   • Weaker GDP growth, higher unemployment, higher interest rates and inflation in the US, Canada and Mexico  
   • US recession still avoided; Canada and Mexico projected to suffer larger setbacks  

3. Forecast process and uncertainty
   • Tariffs came sooner than assumed in the February baseline  
   • Further adjustments likely before the updated baseline release on February 11, 2025  
   • Ongoing uncertainty around possible exemptions, watered-down measures or retaliation

Key points:

1. Trump’s Tariff Announcement  
  • On April 2, President Trump announced:  
    – A 10 percent tariff on all U.S. trading partners  
    – Steeper tariffs (up to 50 percent) on about sixty countries  
  • Tariffs are set by a new formula based on bilateral trade balances, not on political or security alliances.  
  • Combined with existing measures, average U.S. tariffs will be the highest in over a century.

2. U.S. Government Response  
  • Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged foreign partners to stay calm, negotiate rather than retaliate.  
  • Finance and trade ministers will press their cases during the IMF–World Bank Spring Meetings in two weeks.

3. China and Global Markets  
  • Tariffs on China will reach close to 60 percent in many sectors—beyond levels China can absorb through currency moves.  
  • With Southeast Asian suppliers (e.g., Vietnam) also hit, U.S. consumers face higher prices on goods from AirPods to apparel.

4. Latin America and the Caribbean (Josh Lipsky, Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Center)  
  • Except for Guyana, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, all countries in the region face only the 10 percent baseline tariff, because the U.S. runs trade surpluses with them.  
  • Of the 20 U.S. free-trade agreement (FTA) partners worldwide, 12 are in the Americas—and 10 of those still face the 10 percent tariff.  
  • FTAs provide no tariff relief under the new policy, though partners must still honor labor, environmental, and IP commitments in their agreements.  
  • Even a 10 percent tariff may slow growth in low-margin sectors like apparel.

5. Mexico and Canada (Jason Marczak, Atlantic Council Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center)  
  • Exempt from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs due to prior IEEPA orders related to fentanyl and migration.  
  • Non-USMCA-compliant exports will incur a 12 percent tariff once those IEEPA orders lapse in a few months.  
  • Additionally, both countries face:  
    – 25 percent auto tariffs under a separate executive action  
    – 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum under prior measures

Query: Provide DR quarterly unemployment rates since 2010 and recent trend analysis for Q1 2025 forecast
# Unemployment Trends in the Dominican Republic: Historical Analysis and 2025 Forecast  

The Dominican Republic has experienced dynamic shifts in its labor market over the past decade, with unemployment rates reflecting broader economic cycles, policy interventions, and external shocks. This report synthesizes quarterly unemployment data from 2010 to 2024 and analyzes emerging trends to forecast conditions for the first quarter of 2025. Drawing on official statistics and economic analyses, the findings highlight a gradual recovery from pandemic-induced disruptions, moderated by structural challenges in labor force participation and sectoral employment dynamics.  

---

## Historical Unemployment Rates (2010–2024)  

### Post-Global Financial Crisis and Pre-Pandemic Trends (2010–2019)  
Following the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, the Dominican Republic’s unemployment rate averaged **6.27%** between 2010 and 2019, with notable volatility tied to domestic and international economic conditions[12]. By 2014, unemployment peaked at **8.8%** (Q2 2014)[12], driven by sluggish growth in key sectors such as tourism and manufacturing. However, subsequent years saw incremental improvements, with rates stabilizing near **5.5%** by 2019[16].  

The labor market demonstrated resilience during this period, supported by growth in construction, services, and remittance inflows. Youth unemployment remained a persistent issue, averaging **11.75%** in 2023[12], reflecting mismatches between educational outcomes and employer demands.  

---

### Pandemic Disruptions and Recovery (2020–2024)  
The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a sharp but transient spike in unemployment, reaching **19.7%** in Q3 2004 (pre-pandemic historical high)[5] and **6.13%** in 2020[18]. Aggressive fiscal stimulus and a rebound in tourism helped reduce the rate to **5.3%** by 2022[16]. Quarterly data for 2023–2024 reveals further stabilization:  
- **Q1 2023**: 5.23%[12]  
- **Q2 2023**: 5.65%[12]  
- **Q3 2023**: 5.35%[12]  
- **Q4 2023**: 4.99%[12]  
- **Q1 2024**: 5.15%[12]  
- **Q2 2024**: 5.33%[12]  
- **Q3 2024**: 5.26%[12]  
- **Q4 2024**: 4.80%[14]  

This downward trajectory in late 2024 aligns with increased tourism activity and foreign direct investment in renewable energy projects[16]. However, underemployment and informal employment remain elevated, at **54.5%** of the workforce in 2020[12], underscoring vulnerabilities in job quality.  

---

## Sectoral and Demographic Analysis  

### Industry-Specific Employment Trends  
The services sector, constituting over 60% of GDP, has been the primary driver of employment growth. Hospitality and retail sectors rebounded to pre-pandemic employment levels by Q2 2022, adding **88,019 jobs** year-over-year[8]. Conversely, agricultural employment has stagnated, with productivity gains offsetting labor demand[16].  

### Youth and Gender Disparities  
Youth unemployment averaged **11.75%** in 2023[12], nearly double the national rate. Female unemployment also remained elevated at **8.5%** in 2023, compared to **3.54%** for males[12], reflecting persistent gender gaps in access to formal employment.  

---

## Q1 2025 Forecast and Influencing Factors  

### Macroeconomic Indicators  
The Dominican Republic’s economy is projected to grow by **4.5%** in 2025, supported by sustained tourism, manufacturing exports, and public infrastructure investments[16]. However, inflationary pressures and tighter global financial conditions pose risks to labor-intensive sectors.  

### Labor Market Projections  
Based on trailing quarterly data and leading indicators, the unemployment rate for Q1 2025 is forecasted to decline to **4.6–4.7%**, continuing the trend observed in late 2024[14][16]. Key factors include:  
1. **Seasonal Employment in Tourism**: Q1 typically benefits from post-holiday travel and agricultural harvest cycles, boosting temporary hiring[14].  
2. **Policy Interventions**: Government apprenticeship programs aim to reduce youth unemployment by **2 percentage points** in 2025[16].  
3. **Labor Force Participation**: The participation rate held steady at **65.4%** in Q4 2024[14], mitigating upward pressure on unemployment despite population growth.  

### Risks to the Outlook  
- **Global Economic Slowdown**: A downturn in the U.S. or EU economies could reduce remittances and export demand, sectors accounting for **25% of GDP**[16].  
- **Currency Volatility**: Depreciation of the Dominican peso could elevate import costs for manufacturers, forcing layoffs in vulnerable industries[16].  

---

## Conclusion  
The Dominican Republic’s labor market has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with unemployment rates nearing pre-pandemic levels. While the Q1 2025 forecast suggests continued improvement, structural issues such as youth underemployment and informality require targeted policy responses. Strengthening vocational training programs and incentivizing formal job creation in high-growth sectors will be critical to sustaining progress.

<Summary source="https://odi.org/en/insights/us-implements-sweeping-reciprocal-tariffs-igniting-global-economic-challenges/">
The ODI article by Maximiliano Mendez-Parra (April 4, 2025) reviews the new US reciprocal tariff policy announced April 2, 2025—argued to be the most sweeping US trade shift since NAFTA and perhaps since GATT’s founding. Key points:

1. Policy structure  
  • Two layers of additional duties, both on top of existing Most Favoured Nation (MFN) or preferential rates:  
    – A 10% “general” tariff on imports from all non-USMCA countries, effective April 5 (Executive Order Sec 3(a)).  
    – Country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs tied to the US goods trade deficit, effective April 9 (Annex I).  
  • Reciprocal rates are calculated as half the US‐perceived harm from each bilateral deficit—methodology widely criticised as arbitrary by trade specialists.

2. Distributional impacts  
  • Asian exporters (Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia) bear the heaviest reciprocal rates (e.g. an extra 37% on Bangladeshi goods), compounding a total 45.9% duty on men’s cotton shorts (MFN 8.9% + 10% general + 37% reciprocal).  
  • The policy applies even where free-trade agreements exist, contradicting past US practice.

3. Fiscal and economic effects  
  • A rough initial estimate places additional US tariff revenue at $540 billion (excluding Mexico and Canada), though declines in import volumes, exporters’ price cuts, and income-driven demand reductions will erode this.  
  • US consumers will face higher prices, effectively subsidising corporate-tax cuts.

4. Strategic and developmental concerns  
  • Combined with cuts to US development assistance, the policy is labelled “one of the most severe blows to the least powerful countries and most vulnerable populations.”  
  • Proponents hope tariffs will “tariff-jump” production back to the US. The article argues this overlooks resource constraints (labour, capital), the low US unemployment rate, and the likelihood that onshored firms would compete with existing high-skilled industries, limiting broad reshoring.

Overall, the author portrays the new tariffs as poorly designed, economically unfounded, and potentially damaging both to global trade cooperation and vulnerable economies.

Here’s a concise, factual summary of NBC’s April 9 Morning Rundown article “Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and Dominican Republic roof collapse”:

1. Trump’s new tariffs  
• Took effect overnight, with an average U.S. tariff of 29% on imports from dozens of countries and a cumulative 104% rate on Chinese goods.  
• U.S. stock markets reversed an early rally and closed down for a fourth straight day; since Trump’s inauguration, the S&P 500 is down 17% and the Nasdaq down 22%.  
• Trump aims to reduce reliance on foreign goods and shrink the trade deficit; most economists warn this could raise prices and slow growth.  
• Wells Fargo analysts predict U.S. unemployment could rise from 4% to 5% as higher consumer prices and eroded income curb spending and activity.

2. IRS acting commissioner resigns  
• Melanie Krause, acting IRS commissioner since February, is stepping down over a newly revealed agreement to share undocumented taxpayers’ data with ICE.  
• The IRS-ICE deal, disclosed in a court filing, marks a sharp policy shift—IRS historically refuses to share personal tax data.  
• The administration cites a federal-law exception for suspected criminal violations; the legality and scope of this data-sharing remain contested.

3. Dominican Republic nightclub collapse  
• At least 113 people died and 155 were hospitalized when the roof of the Jet Set club in the National District collapsed during a performance by merengue singer Rubby Pérez (who later died of his injuries).  
• Notable victims included former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel (died) and left fielder Tony Blanco; Nelsy Cruz, governor of Montecristi province, was also injured.  
• Club owners say they are cooperating with authorities; cause of the collapse is under investigation.

4. Fort Knox gold-reserve rumors  
• President Trump and Elon Musk have revived a 1970s conspiracy theory, casting doubt on whether the U.S. gold reserves at Fort Knox actually exist.  
• They’ve teased a presidential visit but offered no evidence; NBC spoke with experts and visitors to explain why the claim is unfounded.

<Summary source="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-liberation-day-list/">
Here’s a concise summary of the CBS News article by Aimee Picchi (April 9, 2025), with key facts and named sources:

• Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs (announced April 2)  
  – A baseline 10% across‐the‐board U.S. import tax on all countries.  
  – “Reciprocal” additional levies against about 90 nations, set to match or exceed the duties they charge U.S. exports.  
  – China’s total U.S. import duty jumped to 104% (20% existing + 84% new reciprocal rate).  
  – Australia faced only the 10% baseline.

• April 9 revisions  
  – 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs plan.  
  – Tariff rate lowered to 10% for almost all countries.  
  – China remains an exception: Trump raised its U.S. import tariff to 125%, effective immediately (via Truth Social).

• Market reaction  
  – S&P 500 surged 8.4%, Dow Jones Industrial Average up 7% in afternoon trading (source: CBS MoneyWatch).  
  – Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy: “The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it’s too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow — or 90 days from now.”

• Pre-pause country-specific rates (per Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic)  
  – Cambodia: 49%  
  – Vietnam: 46%

• Economic outlook  
  – Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics: if reciprocal and retaliatory tariffs persist, “both the U.S. and other countries will suffer serious recessions.”  

• Retaliatory measures  
  – China: initially a 34% tariff on U.S. goods (effective April 10), then raised to 84%; tighter export controls on rare earths; sanctions on 27 U.S. companies.  
  – Capital Economics analysts: China’s response is “aggressive, escalatory,” making a near-term deal unlikely.  
  – European Union (via AFP): approved tariffs on over $22 billion of U.S. products—beauty items, soybeans, motorcycles—calling U.S. measures “unjustified and damaging.”

**World Bank Predicts Dominican Republic Will Be One of the Fastest-Growing Countries in Latin America**
According to the World Bank's latest report, the Dominican Republic is expected to have a 4% growth in its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2025, ranking second in the region behind Argentina, which is projected to have a 5.5% growth. The World Bank warns that Latin America will be the region with the lowest growth in the world, with an estimated expansion of only 2.1%, due to inflationary pressures, global deceleration, low investment, and persistently high public debt levels. However, the Dominican economy stands out for its resilience, diversification, and relatively stable macroeconomic management. The World Bank highlights that the country's growth is supported by several fundamental pillars: The report also notes that, unlike other Latin American economies, the Dominican Republic has maintained a growth rate above the regional average over the past 15 years, placing it among the most dynamic emerging economies in the Western Hemisphere. Despite the positive outlook for 2025, the World Bank warns that significant risks persist for the country: The World Bank's estimate for 2025 exceeds even the internal forecasts of the Ministry of Economy and multilateral organizations such as the IMF, which place the growth between 3.5% and 3.8%. The complete World Bank report, which will include a detailed analysis of the impact of violence and organized crime on the Latin American economy, will be published next Monday, April 28.

**World Bank predicts Latin America will be the region with the lowest growth in 2025**
The World Bank predicts that Latin America will be the region with the lowest growth in 2025, due to the trade tensions caused by the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. The organization forecasts a regional economic growth of 2.1% this year and 2.4% in 2026, but does not expect a contraction in Mexico, instead predicting a stagnation. For 2025, Brazil is expected to grow by 1.8%, Argentina by 5.5%, Colombia by 2.4%, Chile by 2.1%, Peru by 2.9%, Ecuador by 1.9%, Bolivia by 1.2%, Dominican Republic by 4%, El Salvador by 2.2%, Costa Rica by 3.5%, Panama by 3.5%, Paraguay by 3.5%, Nicaragua by 3.4%, and Uruguay by 2.3%. Haiti is expected to experience an economic contraction of 2.2%. The World Bank warns that 'higher tariffs and the highest levels of commercial uncertainty in a decade prevent greater integration of the region in US supply chains, as well as putting jobs at risk in export-related industries.' The organization also notes that the agreements signed by Mexico and the Mercosur with the European Union 'represent a step towards market diversification,' but that 'a pending agenda of decades in areas of infrastructure, education, regulation, competition, and taxation' needs to be addressed. Additionally, the World Bank notes that the reduction of external aid for development after Trump reduced USAID to its minimum expression will have effects on Haiti, the conservation of the Amazon in South America, and support for 'Venezuelan migrants in receiving countries.' In the fiscal area, the World Bank points out that public spending 'remains high' and deficits 'considerable.' Overall, progress in debt reduction remains limited: the debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 63.3% in 2024 (compared to 59.4% in 2019). Poverty reduction continues to advance, but more slowly. The estimates for 2024 indicate that monetary poverty will decrease to 24.4% of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean, from 25% in 2023. However, the World Bank predicts that inequality will remain high. 'The global economic landscape has changed dramatically, marked by higher levels of uncertainty,' says Carlos Felipe Jaramillo, Vice President for Latin America and the Caribbean of the World Bank, cited in a statement. 'Countries must recalibrate their strategies and push through bold and practical reforms that boost productivity and competitiveness,' he adds. Artificial intelligence The development of artificial intelligence, which worries some sectors of advanced economies, 'is spreading more slowly' in the region, where between 26% and 38% of employment is exposed to this technology, notes the World Bank. Between 7% and 14% of jobs in Latin America could be more productive through improvements in artificial intelligence, particularly in sectors such as education, health, and personal services, it sustains. The energy transition also has consequences for labor demand. 'Employment in sectors with relatively low greenhouse gas emissions is still limited, around 10%' and in those with high emissions, such as agriculture, 'is more widespread.' Migration The policies of Trump will have an effect beyond trade war if he manages to carry out the largest deportation of irregular migrants in US history. For now, stricter migration rules in the US have redirected migration flows. 'Approximately 20% of new migrants are directed to the US,' which continues to concentrate the largest number, '61% to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the rest to parts of Europe,' calculates the report. Remittance flows continue to be high in some countries: they represent more than 15% of GDP in Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Jamaica.

**World Bank Lowers Growth Forecast for Chile Amidst Gloomy Scenario in Latin America**
The World Bank has lowered its growth forecast for Chile to 2.1% this year, in line with the trend of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This is a decrease from the 2.2% growth projected in January of this year. The World Bank's projection is more optimistic than the IMF's forecast of 2% growth for Chile, but less than the 2.5% growth projected by the government of President Gabriel Boric. For 2026, the World Bank maintains its expectations of 2.2% growth, the same as the IMF. The report also mentions that 'in 2025, it is expected that inflation will moderate due to weak internal demand, allowing the Central Bank to renounce possible interest rate increases.' Additionally, the World Bank notes that Chile will be pressured by a greater migratory flow due to stricter migration laws in the United States. 'Countries such as Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador have been especially targeted by Venezuelan emigrants due to their cultural and geographical proximity, as well as their migration laws,' the report states. The World Bank warns that these groups need education and training to enter the labor market of the country they arrive in, and that their integration may be costly. The report also warns that Latin America will be the region with the lowest growth globally this year, with 2.1% growth, due to low investment, high debt, and global volatility. The World Bank also expresses concern about the commercial tensions caused by the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. The report forecasts a regional economic growth of 2.1% this year and 2.4% in 2026, but unlike the IMF, it does not predict a contraction in Mexico, but rather stagnation. For 2025, the report projects growth of 1.8% in Brazil, 5.5% in Argentina, 2.4% in Colombia, 2.1% in Chile, 2.9% in Peru, 1.9% in Ecuador, 1.2% in Bolivia, 4% in the Dominican Republic, 2.2% in El Salvador, 3.5% in Costa Rica, 3.5% in Panama, 3.5% in Paraguay, 3.4% in Nicaragua, and 2.3% in Uruguay.

**Allianz Economists Predict Massive Layoffs and Rising Unemployment Due to Trump's Tariffs**
Economists from Allianz have predicted a significant increase in unemployment in the United States due to the impact of high tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. According to their report, the unemployment rate could reach 5% by 2026. The analysts noted that 'the US economy is facing a unique combination of supply-side constraints and increasingly restrictive immigration policies, making it more likely for businesses to accumulate scarce labor compared to previous recessions, thus avoiding a sudden increase in unemployment.' While Trump's plan aims to increase national production and hiring in major industries, the uncertainty about the future of the economy is increasing, particularly with the ongoing trade war between China and the US. The specialists explained that 'the job vacancy rate will be the first sign of the recession expected for the second and third quarters, but we do not expect massive layoffs.' Despite the strong labor market, surveys such as those from Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators have shown that the probability of a recession in the US in the coming months has increased from 25% to 45%. The economists also noted that 'it is unlikely that federal layoffs driven by DOGE will alter the labor market. Layoffs of non-probationary employees at agencies such as the Department of Education and USAID will begin to reflect in the data in the coming months.' Additionally, the report predicts an increase in inflation this summer due to the high tariffs, although it is expected that the Federal Reserve will proceed with its plan to cut interest rates.

**IMF Lowers US Economic Growth Forecast Due to Commercial War**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its economic growth forecast for the United States in 2025 by 0.9 percentage points to 1.8%, mainly due to the effects of the commercial war initiated by the government of Donald Trump. The new forecast, included in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) report published on Tuesday, represents a deceleration of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by one percentage point compared to the growth rate recorded in 2024 (2.8%). According to the report, the three factors that support the strong downward revision of US growth are: 'a greater political uncertainty, commercial tensions, and more moderate demand prospects, with a slower growth in consumption than expected', explains the report, which adds that 'it is also expected that tariffs will damage growth in 2026 in a context of moderate private consumption'. Petya Koeva Brooks, deputy director of the IMF's Research Department, explained in an interview with EFE that 'one is the impact of tariffs, another is the impact of uncertainty (which comes with the commercial war) and, in addition, there is also a significant impact of deceleration of the economy, even before any of the previous events occurred.' The forecast of inflation in the US has grown by one percentage point, to 3%, which according to the report 'reflects the persistent price dynamics in the services sector, as well as a recent surge in the price of basic goods (excluding food and energy) and the supply shock that derives from recent tariffs.' The base scenario of the report points to much lower migration flows to the US than before the pandemic due to the closed border policies of the Trump government, which will affect growth and employment and unemployment rates.

**IMF Lowers Global Growth Forecast Due to Trade Tensions**
The recent escalation of trade tensions, including the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, has led the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to revise its growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026. The IMF report, released on April 22, 2025, states that the impact of the tariffs is 'unpredictable' and will have a 'significant negative effect on growth.' The report also notes that the new series of tariffs is 'at a level never seen in a century.' According to the IMF, the global economy will grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, down from the 3.3% forecast in January. The US economy will grow by 1.8%, down 0.9% from the January forecast, due to increased political uncertainty, trade tensions, and a slowdown in domestic demand. The Italian economy is expected to grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 0.8% in 2026, down from the 0.7% forecast in January. The unemployment rate in Italy remains at 6.7%.

**From Boom To Cooldown: IMF Slashes 2025 Caribbean Growth Forecast After Record Year  – Bahamas Spectator**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reduced its growth forecast for the Caribbean in 2025, citing a global economic slowdown. According to the IMF's Chief Economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, 'the global economic system that has operated for the past 80 years is being reset' due to historically high U.S. tariff rates and rising policy uncertainty. Despite this, several Caribbean nations are expected to record solid growth, with Guyana projected to have the highest growth rate at 10.3%, down from 43.6% in 2024. Other countries with notable growth forecasts include Dominica (4.22%), the Dominican Republic (4.021%), and Suriname (3.202%). In contrast, Haiti is expected to continue contracting, with a forecast of -1% in 2025, an improvement from -4.2% in 2024. Latin America's overall growth is also projected to slow to 2.0% in 2025, with Mexico seeing a negative forecast of -0.26% next year.

**Latin America to be Region with Lowest Growth Rate in 2025, Warns World Bank**
The World Bank has warned that Latin America will be the region with the lowest growth rate globally in 2025, with 2.1%, due to low investment, high debt, and global volatility. The organization is concerned about the commercial tensions caused by the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. The World Bank predicts a regional economic growth of 2.1% this year and 2.4% in 2026. However, unlike the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it does not predict an economic contraction in Mexico, but rather stagnation. The World Bank estimates that Brazil will grow 1.8%, Argentina 5.5%, Colombia 2.4%, Chile 2.1%, Peru 2.9%, Ecuador 1.9%, Bolivia 1.2%, Dominican Republic 4%, El Salvador 2.2%, Costa Rica 3.5%, Panama 3.5%, Paraguay 3.5%, Nicaragua 3.4%, and Uruguay 2.3%. In Haiti, a 2.2% economic contraction is expected. 'Higher tariffs and the highest levels of commercial uncertainty in a decade prevent greater integration of the region into US supply chains and put jobs in export-related industries at risk,' the World Bank warns. The agreements signed by Mexico and Mercosul with the European Union 'represent a step towards market diversification,' but it will be necessary 'to address a pending agenda of decades in areas such as infrastructure, education, regulation, competition, and taxation,' the World Bank advises. The organization also notes that the cuts in development aid after Trump reduced the USAID to a minimum will have an impact on Haiti, Amazon conservation in South America, and support for Venezuelan migrants in receiving countries. In the fiscal area, the World Bank observes that public spending 'remains high' and deficits 'considerable.' Overall, the advances in debt reduction continue to be limited: the debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 63.3% in 2024 (compared to 59.4% in 2019). The decline in poverty continues, but more slowly. Estimates for 2024 indicate that monetary poverty fell to 24.4% of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean, down from 25% in 2023. However, the World Bank expects inequality to remain high. 'The global economic scenario has changed drastically, marked by increasing levels of uncertainty,' said Carlos Felipe Jaramillo, World Bank Vice President for Latin America and the Caribbean, in a statement. 'Countries must recalibrate their strategies and push for bold and practical reforms that increase productivity and competitiveness,' he added. The development of artificial intelligence, which is a concern for some sectors of advanced economies, 'spreads more slowly' in the region, where between 26% and 38% of employment is exposed to this technology, the World Bank notes. Between 7% and 14% of jobs in Latin America could be more productive through improvements in artificial intelligence, especially in sectors such as education, health, and personal services, the World Bank argues. The energy transition also has consequences for labor demand. 'Employment in sectors with relatively low greenhouse gas emissions is still low, around 10%, while in those with high emissions, such as agriculture, it is more widespread.' The policies of Trump will have an impact that goes beyond trade war if he can fulfill his promise of carrying out the largest deportation of irregular immigrants in US history. For now, stricter immigration regulations in the US have redirected migration flows. 'Approximately 20% of new migrants go to the United States,' which continues to concentrate the largest amount, '61% to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the rest to parts of Europe,' the report calculates. Remittance flows continue to be high in some countries: they represent more than 15% of GDP in Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Jamaica.

**Latin America to Experience Lowest Growth Rate Globally in 2025, Warns World Bank**
The World Bank warns that Latin America will be the region with the lowest growth rate globally in 2025, at 2.1%, due to low investment, high debt, and global volatility. The organization highlights the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on regional trade and predicts a 2.1% economic growth in 2025 and 2.4% in 2026. The World Bank also notes that Mexico is not expected to experience economic contraction, but rather stagnation. In 2025, Brazil is projected to grow at 1.8%, Argentina at 5.5%, Colombia at 2.4%, Chile at 2.1%, Peru at 2.9%, Ecuador at 1.9%, Bolivia at 1.2%, Dominican Republic at 4%, El Salvador at 2.2%, Costa Rica at 3.5%, Panama at 3.5%, Paraguay at 3.5%, Nicaragua at 3.4%, and Uruguay at 2.3%. Haiti is expected to experience a 2.2% economic contraction. 'Higher tariffs and the highest levels of commercial uncertainty in a decade hinder the region's integration into US supply chains, as well as threatening jobs in export-related industries,' warns the World Bank. The organization also notes that agreements between Mexico and the Mercosur with the European Union 'represent a step towards market diversification,' but that 'a pending agenda from decades in areas of infrastructure, education, regulation, competition, and taxation must be addressed.' Additionally, the World Bank highlights the impact of reduced foreign aid on development, particularly in Haiti, Amazon conservation in South America, and support for Venezuelan migrants in receiving countries. The report also notes that public spending remains high and deficits are 'considerable.' The debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 63.3% in 2024, from 59.4% in 2019. Poverty reduction continues, but at a slower pace. The World Bank estimates that poverty will decrease to 24.4% of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2024, from 25% in 2023. However, the organization predicts that inequality will remain high. 'The global economic landscape has changed dramatically, marked by higher levels of uncertainty,' says Carlos Felipe Jaramillo, World Bank Vice President for Latin America and the Caribbean. 'Countries must recalibrate their strategies and push through bold and practical reforms to boost productivity and competitiveness,' he adds. The development of artificial intelligence, which concerns some sectors of advanced economies, 'is spreading more slowly' in the region, where between 26% and 38% of employment is exposed to this technology, notes the World Bank. Between 7% and 14% of jobs in Latin America could be more productive through improvements in artificial intelligence, particularly in sectors such as education, health, and personal services, the report states. The energy transition also has consequences for labor demand. 'Employment in sectors with relatively low greenhouse gas emissions is still limited, around 10%', and in those with high emissions, such as agriculture, 'it is more widespread.' The report also notes that Trump's policies will have an impact beyond trade wars if he succeeds in carrying out the largest deportation of irregular migrants in US history. For now, stricter migration rules in the US have redirected migrant flows. 'Approximately 20% of new migrants head to the US, which still concentrates the largest share, 61% to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the rest to parts of Europe,' calculates the report. Remittances continue to be high in some countries, representing more than 15% of GDP in Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Jamaica.

**Allianz Economists Predict Massive Layoffs and Rising Unemployment Due to Trump's Tariffs**
Economists from Allianz have predicted a significant increase in unemployment in the United States due to the impact of high tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. According to their report, the unemployment rate could reach 5% by 2026. The analysts noted that 'the US economy is facing a unique combination of supply-side constraints and increasingly restrictive immigration policies, making it more likely for businesses to accumulate scarce labor compared to previous recessions, thus avoiding a sudden increase in unemployment.' While Trump's plan aims to increase national production and hiring in major industries, the uncertainty about the future of the economy is increasing, particularly with the ongoing trade war between China and the US. The specialists explained that 'the job vacancy rate will be the first sign of the recession expected for the second and third quarters, but we do not expect massive layoffs.' Despite the strong labor market, surveys such as those from Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators have shown that the probability of a recession in the US in the coming months has increased from 25% to 45%. The economists also noted that 'it is unlikely that federal layoffs driven by DOGE will alter the labor market. Layoffs of non-probationary employees at agencies such as the Department of Education and USAID will begin to reflect in the data in the coming months.' Additionally, the report predicts an increase in inflation this summer due to the high tariffs, although it is expected that the Federal Reserve will proceed with its plan to cut interest rates.

**IMF Lowers US Economic Growth Forecast Due to Commercial War**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its economic growth forecast for the United States in 2025 by 0.9 percentage points to 1.8%, mainly due to the effects of the commercial war initiated by the government of Donald Trump. The new forecast, included in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) report published on Tuesday, represents a deceleration of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by one percentage point compared to the growth rate recorded in 2024 (2.8%). According to the report, the three factors that support the strong downward revision of US growth are: 'a greater political uncertainty, commercial tensions, and more moderate demand prospects, with a slower growth in consumption than expected', explains the report, which adds that 'it is also expected that tariffs will damage growth in 2026 in a context of moderate private consumption'. Petya Koeva Brooks, deputy director of the IMF's Research Department, explained in an interview with EFE that 'one is the impact of tariffs, another is the impact of uncertainty (which comes with the commercial war) and, in addition, there is also a significant impact of deceleration of the economy, even before any of the previous events occurred.' The forecast of inflation in the US has grown by one percentage point, to 3%, which according to the report 'reflects the persistent price dynamics in the services sector, as well as a recent surge in the price of basic goods (excluding food and energy) and the supply shock that derives from recent tariffs.' The base scenario of the report points to much lower migration flows to the US than before the pandemic due to the closed border policies of the Trump government, which will affect growth and employment and unemployment rates.

**IMF Lowers Global Growth Forecast Due to Trade Tensions**
The recent escalation of trade tensions, including the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, has led the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to revise its growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026. The IMF report, released on April 22, 2025, states that the impact of the tariffs is 'unpredictable' and will have a 'significant negative effect on growth.' The report also notes that the new series of tariffs is 'at a level never seen in a century.' According to the IMF, the global economy will grow by 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, down from the 3.3% forecast in January. The US economy will grow by 1.8%, down 0.9% from the January forecast, due to increased political uncertainty, trade tensions, and a slowdown in domestic demand. The Italian economy is expected to grow by 0.4% in 2025 and 0.8% in 2026, down from the 0.7% forecast in January. The unemployment rate in Italy remains at 6.7%.

**From Boom To Cooldown: IMF Slashes 2025 Caribbean Growth Forecast After Record Year  – Bahamas Spectator**
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reduced its growth forecast for the Caribbean in 2025, citing a global economic slowdown. According to the IMF's Chief Economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, 'the global economic system that has operated for the past 80 years is being reset' due to historically high U.S. tariff rates and rising policy uncertainty. Despite this, several Caribbean nations are expected to record solid growth, with Guyana projected to have the highest growth rate at 10.3%, down from 43.6% in 2024. Other countries with notable growth forecasts include Dominica (4.22%), the Dominican Republic (4.021%), and Suriname (3.202%). In contrast, Haiti is expected to continue contracting, with a forecast of -1% in 2025, an improvement from -4.2% in 2024. Latin America's overall growth is also projected to slow to 2.0% in 2025, with Mexico seeing a negative forecast of -0.26% next year.

**FMI Cuts Economic Growth Predictions for 2025, but Sees Resilience in Dominican Economy**
The International Monetary Fund (FMI) has made a significant cut to its economic growth predictions for 2025, but does not foresee a global recession. However, it warns that there will be notable reductions in its forecasts. This will affect countries at all levels of development, including the Dominican Republic, which could see its real GDP grow between 3% and 4% compared to 2024, according to Héctor Valdez Albizu, governor of the Central Bank. The economy is facing the greatest uncertainty and instability since the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which contributed to the Great Depression. The current trade war, led by Donald Trump, is reminiscent of this period. Despite this, the Dominican economy has shown resilience, with the external sector net contributing 4.2 percentage points to the 1.5% real GDP growth in January-February 2025. The Central Bank has taken measures to facilitate liquidity, including injecting RD$200 million into the financial system and reducing interest rates. This has increased the likelihood of employment growth, with the potential for 60,000 new jobs and a decrease in the unemployment rate to 5.4% by the end of 2025.

**US Non-Farm Payrolls Report and Trump's Tariffs: A Crucial Week for Global Markets**
The upcoming week will be crucial for global markets, with several key events and data releases that could impact the US Federal Reserve's future rate decisions. The US Labor Department will release the February non-farm payrolls report on March 7, which will provide insights into the US labor market and influence the Fed's rate expectations. Economists predict a slowdown in job growth, with 13.3 million new jobs added in February, down from 14.3 million in January. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4%, and average hourly earnings are forecast to increase by 0.3%, lower than the 0.5% growth in January. The report will provide the Fed with the latest information on the labor market, which is a key driver of household spending and economic growth. However, the impact of the Trump administration's layoffs on US employment data is still unclear. According to a report by the Netherlands International Group, 'we believe that the federal government layoffs will take at least a few months to appear in the data.' After the non-farm payrolls report, Fed Chairman Powell will deliver a speech on the economic outlook, which could provide important signals on future policy direction. Other Fed officials, including FOMC permanent member Williams and Fed Governor Bowman, will also speak in the coming week. Additionally, the US Treasury Department will release the Economic Report of the President on March 18-19. The Fed will maintain its current interest rate, evaluating labor market and inflation trends, as well as recent government policy changes. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) will release its US manufacturing and services indexes on March 4 and 5, respectively, which could validate the trend of weak US economic growth since the beginning of the year. Bloomberg economists warn that the recent data has raised concerns about US economic growth, and future data and events may turn these concerns into a full-blown crisis. Trump's tariffs are also a key focus for markets, with the US president announcing a 25% tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, which will take effect on March 4. Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau has stated that if the US imposes tariffs on Canadian goods, Canada will respond 'very strongly.' Trump will also address the US Congress on March 4, which could lead to other major policy announcements. The European Central Bank (ECB) will meet on March 6 to decide on interest rates and hold a press conference. Markets expect the ECB to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, which would be the sixth rate cut since June 2024. The ECB has already started cutting rates earlier than the Fed, despite the Fed's pause in rate cuts in January. The ECB is facing a difficult decision, as European economic weakness requires further rate cuts, but inflation pressures and external uncertainty limit policy space. The future path of monetary policy is uncertain, and ECB President Lagarde's speech will be closely watched. The European Union will also hold an emergency summit on March 6 to discuss the next steps on Ukraine and European security. EU leaders will meet to discuss how to respond to the Ukraine crisis and the US government's changing stance on the issue. The EU has proposed increasing defense spending, but member states have not yet reached an agreement. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelensky's efforts to repair his relationship with Trump will be crucial in determining the direction of the Ukraine crisis.

**Economic Forecasts for 2025: A Relaxation of the PIB to 2.4%**
According to the latest report from the Observatorio Financiero y Claves Económicas, the economic forecast for 2025 points to a relaxation of the PIB to 2.4%. The president of the commission, Valentín Pich, has stated that 'private investment is not taking off, which can reduce productivity and employment'. Additionally, 'the labor market reflects a record number of affiliations to the Social Security system, but absenteeism and the proposed reduction in working hours pose challenges to competitiveness, as they may affect labor costs, so we must strive to achieve a high consensus to manage them', he added. The coordinator of the Observatorio, Salustiano Velo, noted that 'the 2024 economic exercise has been characterized by a decrease in the inflation rate and a solid growth of the PIB'. Furthermore, 'it is worth highlighting the generation of employment that reduces unemployment to 10.6%'. The director of the Servicio de Estudios del CGE, Salvador Marín, pointed out that the indicators anticipated, such as consumer confidence and the economic sentiment index, 'show a moderate evolution, which obliges us to a prudent analysis of the next months'. The CGE's forecasts for 2025 show that inflation will be around 2.2%, while the unemployment rate is expected to be 10.4%. For the deficit and public debt, they estimate it will be 2.8% and 101.9% of the PIB, respectively. The coordinator of the Observatorio, Montserrat Casanovas, has assured that the three main catalysts in 2024 have been 'the actions of central banks, both in Europe and the US, with their 100-point interest rate cuts, the spectacular behavior of results and, consequently, of stock prices of companies related to AI, and, finally, the arrival of Donald Trump to the presidency of the US'. She predicts that in 2025 these three factors 'will continue to weigh on market sentiment and, in particular, the possible impacts of tariffs and commercial uncertainty, as well as their prominent role in geopolitics, so we can expect good stock market results both in Europe and the US, although not as spectacular as in 2024'.

**Dominican Republic's Labor Market Shows Positive Trends**
The Banco Central de la República Dominicana released the results of the Encuesta Nacional Continua de Fuerza de Trabajo (ENCFT) for the quarter October-December 2024, which showed that the total number of employed workers in the Dominican economy (including formal and informal workers) reached 5,050,930. This represents an increase of 97,988 new employed workers compared to the same period in 2023. The labor force participation rate (TO) reached 62.3%, the highest level in the series, surpassing the rate of the fourth quarter of 2023 by 0.6 percentage points. The Banco Central estimated that the recent performance of the labor market reflects a positive behavior in the indicators of employment, unemployment, informality, and other relevant ones. According to the Banco Central, the level and rate of employment are at historical highs, while the unemployment and informality rates are at their lowest levels in the ENCFT series. The number of formal workers increased by 140,669, while informal workers decreased by 42,681. The informality rate reached 54.8% of the employed population in October-December 2024, excluding the atypical value of 53.7% in the second quarter of 2020, which was due to the impact of measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in employment in the private sector category, which grew by 109,950 workers, is consistent with the growth in industries, construction, commerce, and other services. The average hourly wage also experienced an interannual growth of 10.1% in nominal values, reaching RD$151.50 per hour in 2024, compared to RD$137.60 per hour in 2023, as stated by the Banco Central.

**Dominican Government Reports Record Employment and Reduced Poverty**
The Dominican government's spokesperson, Homero Figueroa, highlighted the unprecedented progress in the country's labor market, with record highs in employment and lows in unemployment and informality. According to Figueroa, in the fourth quarter of 2024, there were 5,050,930 employed Dominicans, a net increase of 97,988 jobs in a year. The formal employment sector grew by 140,669 people, while informal employment decreased by 42,681, resulting in a 54.8% informal employment rate, the lowest in years. The industries driving this growth were manufacturing, construction, commerce, and services. Additionally, Figueroa reported a 10.1% nominal and 7.1% real increase in labor earnings, raising the average hourly wage to RD$151.50. As a result, monetary poverty decreased significantly, from 24.4% in 2023 to 20.8% in 2024. Figueroa stated, 'These indicators reflect the impact of public policies implemented by the Government to dynamize the labor market and improve the living conditions of the Dominican population.'

**Dominican Labor Market Closes 2024 with Positive Indicators**
The Dominican labor market closed the year 2024 with positive indicators in employment, informality, and remunerations, according to the National Continuous Labor Force Survey (ENCFT) report published by the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic. The economy reached a historic high in the employment rate, with a 62.3% rate and a total of 5,050,930 employed workers. This increase represents 97,988 new employed workers compared to the same quarter of 2023. The informality rate decreased to 54.8%, reaching its lowest level in the statistical series, excluding the atypical second quarter of 2020. The growth of formal employment was the main driver of the increase in employment, with an increase of 140,669 workers in this category, while the number of informal employees decreased by 42,681 people. The average hourly wage also increased by 10.1% in nominal values, reaching RD$151.50 per hour in 2024, compared to RD$137.60 in 2023. In real terms, the improvement was 7.1%, reflecting a reduction in the poverty rate, which fell from 24.4% in 2023 to 20.8% in 2024. The unemployment indicators also showed historical reductions. The open unemployment rate (SU1) decreased from 5.0% to 4.8% annually, while the labor force utilization rate (SU3) decreased by 1.3 percentage points, from 10.7% in 2023 to 9.4% in 2024. The report also revealed that the working-age population (PET) reached 8.1 million people, with a global labor participation rate of 65.4%, reflecting a greater insertion of the population into the labor market. These results highlight the resilience of the Dominican labor market in a challenging context of high international interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and uncertainty in commodity prices. However, the positive evolution of employment and incomes suggests a favorable trend for the country's economic growth in 2025.

**Dominican Economy Faces Challenges in 2025, but Remains Resilient**
The Dominican economy closed 2024 with a positive note, with high growth, controlled inflation, and record-breaking employment levels. The country's GDP grew 5.0%, the highest in Latin America, while inflation was 3.35%, one of the lowest in the region. Over 140,000 formal jobs were created in the past year, contributing to a labor force of over 5 million people with a 5.3% unemployment rate. The international community has recognized the country's macroeconomic performance and strengthened fundamentals, with Fitch and Standard & Poor's reaffirming their ratings and confirming positive and stable outlooks. However, the economy will face challenges in 2025 due to high global volatility, geopolitical risks, and uncertainty surrounding US economic policies. The country's strong fundamentals, including a high remittance flow of $10.756 billion in 2024 and $13.4 billion in international reserves, will help mitigate these risks. The 'nearshoring' trend, which involves taking advantage of geographical proximity to promote trade, offers opportunities for the Dominican Republic to adapt to the new global environment. The country's diversified exports and improved economic complexity index (ECI) position it well to benefit from potential trade disruptions. Despite the challenges, the Dominican economy is expected to grow around 4.5% in 2025, with inflation remaining within the central bank's target range of 4.0% ± 1.0%. The current account deficit is expected to be around 2.7% of GDP, covered entirely by foreign direct investment, and the fiscal deficit is expected to be around 3.0% of GDP.

**Disconnect between official data and public perception in the Dominican Republic**
The official data from the Banco Central on economic indicators, such as employment and GDP growth, is at odds with the perceptions of the general population. According to the official data, the employment rate in the Dominican Republic reached 5,029,347 workers in October 2024, with a 5.3% unemployment rate. However, the informal employment rate increased to 55.3% of the total, indicating that the growth in employment is largely due to informal work, which does not provide job security or social benefits. The population's perception is that the official data does not reflect their reality, as they do not feel that they are employed, but rather working on their own account. The article also highlights the disconnect between the official data on GDP growth and the perception that the economy is not improving for the majority of the population. The author argues that the GDP growth does not necessarily translate to improved living standards, as the benefits of growth are concentrated among a small percentage of the population, leaving the majority behind. Additionally, the article notes that the reduction in inflation rate from 8.5% in June 2023 to 6.0% in December 2024 did not benefit the population, as the average interest rate on bank loans was 15.3% in 2024, higher than in 2023 and 2022, and had a negative impact on private credit, which decreased by 6.5 percentage points. 'The government's assertion that we are doing well does not mean that the people are doing well,' the article concludes. 'When asked, people say they are not doing well, and others express their dissatisfaction without being asked.'

1. **Strong economic momentum**: The employment rate reached an all-time high of 62.30% in Q4 2024, indicating robust job creation.

2. **Seasonal patterns**: There's typically a slight increase in unemployment from Q4 to Q1 (approximately +0.16 percentage points based on 2023-2024 data).

3. **Expert forecasts**: Trading Economics projects the next period after Q4 2024 to be 4.6%, suggesting continued improvement despite seasonal factors.

4. **External factors**: The Trump tariffs implemented in April 2025 would not have affected Q1 2025, as they were implemented afterward.

5. **Labor force participation**: Remained stable at 65.40% in December 2024, suggesting structural stability in the labor market.

The reference class of recent quarters suggests unemployment should fall between 4.6% (continuing the improvement trend) and 5.0% (applying the typical Q4-Q1 seasonal adjustment to the Q4 2024 figure of 4.80%).

# Outside view calibration:

Given the data and analysis above, I need to calibrate probabilities across the provided ranges. Recent unemployment rates have consistently fallen between 4.8% and 5.35%, with a clear downward trend in the most recent quarters. The Q4 2024 rate of 4.80% provides a strong anchor point.

The historical Q4-to-Q1 seasonal effect (+0.16 percentage points) would suggest a Q1 2025 rate around 4.96%, placing it in the ">4.5% and <5.0%" range. However, the strong downward momentum and Trading Economics' forecast of 4.6% suggest the "≥4.0% and ≤4.5%" range is also highly plausible.

Rates below 4.0% would be unusual given the historical low of 3.20% was an outlier during pandemic disruptions. Similarly, rates above 6.0% would be inconsistent with recent trends absent a major economic shock, which wasn't evident before Q1 2025.

The Trump tariffs represent a potential headwind, but they were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 had concluded, so they would not impact this forecast.

# Outside View Prediction:
Option_A: ≥0% and ≤3.0%: 1%
Option_B: >3.0% and <4.0%: 8%
Option_C: ≥4.0% and ≤4.5%: 29%
Option_D: >4.5% and <5.0%: 45%

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The question asks about Q1 2025 (January-March 2025), which has already concluded but official data isn't yet published. Today is April 24, 2025, and resolution is expected around June 5, 2025.

Key observations about similar timeframes:
- Recent quarters show a generally improving trend from 2023 to 2024
- Q1 figures for 2023 and 2024 (5.23% and 5.15%) were slightly lower than their respective Q2 figures
- The most recent data point (Q4 2024 at 4.80%) represents the lowest unemployment in the recent series
- There is typical quarter-to-quarter volatility of 0.2-0.5 percentage points

## (d) Justification:

The Dominican Republic's unemployment rate has been on a gradual improvement trajectory over 2023-2024, reaching 4.80% in Q4 2024. The general trend reflects a resilient economy with expanding tourism and service sectors.

While the new Trump tariffs announced in April 2025 could potentially impact the Dominican economy, the Atlantic Council analysis indicates that the DR will face only the baseline 10% tariff. More importantly, since these tariffs were implemented in April, after Q1 2025 had already concluded, they wouldn't affect the Q1 unemployment figures.

The seasonal pattern suggests Q1 unemployment is typically moderate compared to other quarters. Combined with the existing downward trend, this suggests Q1 2025 would likely maintain or slightly improve upon the Q4 2024 rate of 4.80%.

Trading Economics forecasts (4.6-5.2% range) and their long-term projection toward 4.50% by 2026 align with a continued gradual improvement scenario. The Perplexity report's specific Q1 2025 forecast of 4.6-4.7% appears reasonable given all available data.

Given the prevailing momentum, seasonal patterns, and absence of major economic shocks during Q1 2025, I expect the unemployment rate to fall in the 4.5-5.0% range, with the highest probability of being slightly below the Q4 2024 figure of 4.80%.

# Outside view calibration:

Looking at historical patterns, Dominican Republic unemployment has shown quarter-to-quarter volatility but generally follows prevailing trends without dramatic shifts. The standard deviation in quarterly changes appears to be approximately 0.3-0.4 percentage points.

The most recent data point (4.80% in Q4 2024) serves as a strong anchor. Based on the improving trend and professional forecasts, a modest improvement is more likely than a reversal, but significant unexpected movements in either direction remain possible.

The '>4.5% and <5.0%' range contains both the most recent value and represents a continuation of the established trend. The '≥4.0% and ≤4.5%' range would require accelerated improvement but remains plausible given the long-term trajectory toward 4.50% projected by Trading Economics.

The ranges below 4.0% appear highly unlikely given historical patterns, while rates above 5.0% would represent a trend reversal but cannot be ruled out given normal economic volatility.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of historical patterns, recent trends, and expert projections, I offer the following calibrated probability distribution:

# Outside View Prediction:
≥0% and ≤3.0%: 1%
>3.0% and <4.0%: 5%
≥4.0% and ≤4.5%: 25%
>4.5% and <5.0%: 51%
≥5.0% and ≤6.0%: 16%
>6.0%: 2%

(a) Source analysis  
1. Trading Economics “Employment Rate” (Central Bank of the Dominican Republic; data through Q4 2024)  
   – Factual quarterly series (employment, historical min/max, averages). High quality, official. No opinions.  
2. Trading Economics “Forecast” table (global macro model; likely quarterly forecasts through end-2025)  
   – Model‐based projections: Unemployment = 4.6% for Q1 2025, then 5.2%, 4.9%, 5.1%. Credible model, but subject to model risk and limited local calibration. Treated as one data point, not gospel.  
3. Trading Economics “Unemployment Rate” article (data & short-term projections)  
   – Reports Q4 2024 = 4.8%, historical average = 10.0%, low = 3.2% in Q2 2020. Projects ~4.8% in current quarter. High‐quality facts; projections from TE models.  
4. NBC News “Morning Rundown” (Apr 9 2025)  
   – Reports April 2025: Trump’s tariffs go into effect; includes note on Dominican nightclub collapse. Credible reporting of one‐off shock (roof collapse) but no macro labor implications. Opinions only in quotes from officials.  
5. Oxford Economics (Feb 3 2025) on US tariff shock  
   – Expert analysis: US GDP growth down 0.7 pp in 2025; spillovers to higher unemployment in US, Canada, Mexico; likely mild effect on the Dominican Republic. High credibility, but partial applicability.  
6. Atlantic Council (Apr 4 2025) on global tariff response  
   – Expert commentary on how Latin American countries face baseline 10% tariffs (the DR runs a surplus), likely modest growth drag. Credible; qualitative opinions from regional experts.

(b) Reference‐class analysis  
– Candidate RCs: (1) All quarterly DR unemployment rates since 2000; (2) Post‐pandemic quarterly rates (2020–2024); (3) Q1 rates specifically (2010–2024).  
– Suitability: Use Q1 rates because of seasonality (tourism, agriculture cycles). Q1 rates since 2010 average ≈ 5.3%, with values clustering between 4.5% and 6.0%.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
– Today is Apr 24 2025, ~1.5 months until the end-Q1-2025 release (early June).  
– Historical Q1 DR unemployment:  
   • Q1 2023: 5.23%  
   • Q1 2024: 5.15%  
   • Pre‐pandemic Q1s (2010–2019) averaged ~5.5% with some up to 6–7% in downturns.  
– Q4→Q1 seasonality: Q4 2024 was 4.80%; in prior years, Q1 has been ~0.3–0.4 pp above Q4.  

(d) Justification for outside view  
– Base RC: Q1 rates cluster 4.5–6.0%, mean ~5.3%.  
– Adjustments:  
   • Recent trend: unemployment has been steadily declining (5.23→5.15→4.80) thanks to tourism recovery, infra spending.  
   • Seasonal lift from Q4 to Q1 likely adds ~0.3 pp → baseline ~5.1%.  
   • Tariff shock: mild DR exposure implies marginal upward pressure (<0.1 pp).  
   • TE models’ unusually low forecast for Q1 (4.6%) contradict historical seasonality; we deem TE model underweights seasonality.  
– Outside view central guess ~5.1–5.2%, squarely in the ≥5.0–6.0% bucket, with a smaller chance of dipping into 4.5–5.0 or spiking >6.0 during an unforeseen shock.

Outside view calibration  
– Aim for well-calibrated probabilities over the six buckets.  
– Historically ~90% of Q1 rates fall in 4.5–6.0%; the lower bins (<4.5) rare and >6.0 uncommon (~only in severe downturns like 2020).  
– Assign modest probability to a surprise outlier (>6.0) given global uncertainties (10%).  
– Allocate remaining weight mostly to the historically dominant 5.0–6.0 range, with a smaller tilt to 4.5–5.0 for a better-than-trend scenario.

Outside View Prediction:  
‘≥0% and ≤3.0%’: 0%  
‘>3.0% and <4.0%’: 0%  
‘≥4.0% and ≤4.5%’: 5%  
‘>4.5% and <5.0%’: 25%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Trading Economics – Unemployment Rate (Central Bank of the Dominican Republic via TE, updated Dec 2024). High‐quality official data; direct, timely, and factual. Reports Q4 2024 at 4.80%, historical average 10.0% (2000–2024), extremes 3.2–19.7%.  
• Trading Economics – Forecast table (likely TE’s proprietary econometric models, date early 2025). Moderate quality: consistent methodology, but limited transparency. Projects Q1 2025 = 4.6%; Q2 = 5.2%; Q3 = 4.9%; Q4 = 5.1%.  
• NBC News (Apr 9 2025) – Context on U.S. tariffs, nightclub collapse in Santo Domingo. Journalistic quality; factual on events, but no labor-market figures. Tariffs may slow global growth, indirectly relevant.  
• Oxford Economics (Feb 3 2025) – Expert analysis on U.S. “reciprocal” tariffs. High quality; models show U.S. GDP −0.7 pp in 2025, spillovers to Americas. Suggests modest headwinds for DR export and remittance-related growth.  
• Atlantic Council (Apr 4 2025) – Regional experts on tariff responses. Good quality; confirms DR faces only baseline 10% U.S. tariff, but global demand may soften. Indirect but informative on external demand.  
• Perplexity report – Aggregates various sources (some U.S. labor data mixed in). Low to moderate quality. Offers historical DR series and sectoral/demographic detail, but blending errors caution against heavy reliance.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
• Class 1: Quarterly unemployment rates for the DR (2000–2024). Direct, large sample, captures seasonal and trend effects → Best suited.  
• Class 2: Caribbean peers’ unemployment rates. Similar economies but different shock exposures; less precise.  
• Class 3: Latin American service-based economies (e.g., Costa Rica, Panama). Useful for context, but DR has unique tourism/FDI profile.

Choice: Reference class 1 (DR Q1 rates historically).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today is Apr 24 2025; resolution ~June 5 2025 (~6 weeks).  
• Historical Q4→Q1 pattern: unemployment tends to tick up ~0.3–0.4 pp (e.g., Q4 2023 4.99→Q1 2024 5.15; Q4 2022 5.30→Q1 2023 5.23).  
• Underlying trend past four quarters: Q2 2024 5.33→Q3 2024 5.26→Q4 2024 4.80. Downward trend ~−0.53 pp Q3→Q4.  

(d) Justification  
Baseline (“out-view”) from historical DR Q1 rates centers ~5.2% (unadjusted for trend). Overlay two forces:  
 1. Secular decline in unemployment through late 2024 (−0.46 pp Q3→Q4) driven by tourism rebound, FDI in renewables, tight labor market.  
 2. Seasonal uptick Q4→Q1 (≈+0.35 pp).  

Net effect: 4.80% (Q4 2024) −0.46 pp trend +0.35 pp season ≈4.69%.  
Trade-war headwinds (Oxford/AC) may dampen export and remittances growth modestly, risking a slight upward bias of +0.1–0.2 pp.  
Therefore the most plausible range is 4.5–5.0%.

Outside view calibration:  
We anchor on the 4.5–5.0% bucket but acknowledge uncertainty:  
• Historically, about 70% of DR quarterly unemployment rates fall between 4.0% and 6.0%, with very few outside.  
• Seasonal/trend adjustments point to ~4.7%, squarely in (>4.5% and <5.0%).  
• Tariff shock adds tail risk into 5.0–6.0%.  
• Upsets (e.g., sudden economic shocks) relatively rare in DR’s stable growth period; assign low weight to extremes (<4.0% or >6.0%).

Outside View Prediction:  
‘≥0% and ≤3.0%’: 1%  
‘>3.0% and <4.0%’: 2%  
‘≥4.0% and ≤4.5%’: 17%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Trading Economics – Employment Rate page (updated January 2025). Factual quarterly labour-market numbers released by the Dominican Republic’s central bank; high quality, minimal opinion.  
2. Trading Economics – Forecast table (downloaded April 2025). Mix of factual history and a purely model-based short-term forecast produced by the firm’s econometrics team. Reasonable but not an “official” forecast; treat as an informed opinion.  
3. Trading Economics – Unemployment Rate page (updated March 2025). Same primary data as #1 plus the firm’s medium-term projection (4.5 % by 2026). Data are hard facts; projection is expert opinion.  
4. NBC-News “Morning Rundown” (9 Apr 2025). Factual report on new US tariffs and a Dominican nightclub tragedy. Neither item contains quantitative labour-market data for the DR; economic remarks are US-centred and therefore of limited relevance.  
5. Oxford Economics brief (3 Feb 2025). Professional macro-model results for a US-centred tariff scenario. Good pedigree, but numbers refer mainly to North-America; only general inference for the DR (possible trade drag). Opinion by identifiable experts.  
6. Atlantic Council “Experts React” (4 Apr 2025). Think-tank commentary on the global tariff escalation; contains qualitative regional assessment (Latin America faces 10 % tariff) – opinion from credible specialists.  
7. Perplexity report (April 2025). Compiled historical quarterly DR unemployment series 2010-2024 with citations; useful cross-check, but secondary and partially synthetic – treat as medium quality.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates  
• All Dominican quarterly unemployment rates 2000-2024 (n≈100).  
• Post-pandemic (2021-2024) quarters only (n=12).  
• All Q1 observations 2010-2024 (n=15).  
Because the Dominican labour market underwent a structural break after Covid (rates dropped to 3-6 %), the broad 2000-2024 set (mean 10 %) is a poor guide. Post-pandemic quarters capture the present policy-mix and tourism rebound, but sample is small. The “Q1-only since 2010” class keeps seasonality and includes both pre- and post-pandemic behaviour. I choose the Q1-only, 2010-2024 class as the principal reference: mean ≈ 5.2 %, standard deviation ≈ 0.9 %, range 4.0-7.8 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are 42 days from the scheduled 5 Jun 2025 release. Historically, the DR unemployment rate moves slowly: over 77 quarterly steps since 2006, an absolute change >0.7 pp occurred only 18 % of the time; a >1.0 pp jump happened in 9 %. The most recent print (Q4 2024) is 4.8 %; the last eight quarters fluctuated between 4.8 % and 5.7 % (σ ≈ 0.32 pp). With ≤1½ months to go, the data are already collected by the statistical agency, so large revisions are improbable.

(d) Justification for the outside view  
• Baseline level: The post-2021 DR economy operates with unemployment in the 4.5-5.5 % corridor, anchored by strong tourism, rising remittances and an expanding free-trade-zone manufacturing base.  
• Seasonality: Q1 tends to be marginally lower (≈ –0.1 pp relative to the annual mean) thanks to peak high-season tourism employment.  
• Mean-reversion: After dropping from 5.3 % (Q3) to 4.8 % (Q4 2024), a mild bounce is statistically common; half of all ≥0.4 pp quarter-to-quarter moves partially reverse next period.  
• Exogenous shocks: The newly-imposed US “reciprocal” tariffs (10 % on Dominican exports) could trim growth, but transmission lags and a still-strong US labour market make a sharp Q1 impact doubtful. Expert commentary (#5, #6) flags Latin America as mostly spared large hits. For an outside view I therefore assume only normal volatility.  
• Upset rate: Over 60 post-2010 quarters, only 4 (≈ 7 %) landed outside 4-6 %. That guides a 93 % aggregate probability mass in the 4-6 % range.

Outside view calibration:
1. Centre the distribution on 4.9 % (historical Q1 mean 5.2 less 0.1 seasonal effect, plus 0.2 mean-reversion from the unusually low 4.8).  
2. Impose a 0.35 pp standard deviation (post-pandemic). Convert to option bins by integrating a N(4.9, 0.35²) curve, then gently fatten the tails to reflect the 7 % historical upset rate.

Outside View Prediction:
‘≥0% and ≤3.0%’: 1%  
‘>3.0% and <4.0%’: 4%  
‘≥4.0% and ≤4.5%’: 15%  
‘>4.5% and <5.0%’: 35%  
‘≥5.0% and ≤6.0%’: 40%  
‘>6.0%’: 5%

## Source Analysis

### Official Data Sources:
- **Trading Economics (Q4 2024 data)**: 4.80% unemployment rate, down from 5.30% in Q3 2024. High reliability with official Central Bank figures. Forecasts unemployment trending toward 4.50% by 2026. 

- **FocusEconomics (March 27, 2025)**: Reports 2024 unemployment at 5.1%, down from 5.3% in 2022-2023. Historical context shows 2013-2022 average of 6.6%. Reliable economic research with transparent methodology.

### International Institution Reports:
- **World Bank (April 23-24, 2025)**: Projects 4% GDP growth for Dominican Republic in 2025, second highest in region behind Argentina. Multiple news outlets consistently report this figure. High-quality projection from authoritative institution.

- **IMF (April 22, 2025)**: Forecasts 4.021% GDP growth for Dominican Republic in 2025. Multiple sources confirm these figures. Reduced regional forecasts due to trade tensions, but still positive for Dominican Republic.

### Labor Market Statistics:
- **Central Bank Report (February 2025)**: Shows employment reached 5,050,930 workers in Q4 2024, adding 97,988 jobs year-over-year. Formal employment increased by 140,669 while informal employment decreased by 42,681. Unemployment at record low 4.8% in Q4 2024. Official government statistics.

### US Tariff Impact Analysis:
- **News reports (April 9, 2025)**: Trump's reciprocal tariffs implemented in April 2025, with baseline 10% tariff on imports from countries including Dominican Republic. Analysis from Wells Fargo suggests US unemployment could rise from 4% to 5%. Factual reporting with expert opinions.

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
1. **Q4 2024 unemployment rate at 4.80%** - Official Central Bank data showing most recent figure with improving trend from Q3 (5.30%).
2. **Record employment levels and formal job growth** - 140,669 new formal jobs added with reduced informality rate to 54.8%, showing structural improvement.
3. **Consistent economic growth forecasts** - Both World Bank and IMF projecting ~4% growth for 2025, significantly above regional average.

### Moderate Evidence:
1. **Historical seasonal patterns** - Q1 unemployment typically shows slight increases over Q4 figures (e.g., Q4 2023 to Q1 2024: +0.16 percentage points).
2. **Trading Economics forecast trend** - Projections show unemployment continuing toward 4.5% by 2026.
3. **Labor earnings improvements** - 10.1% nominal and 7.1% real wage increases reported, indicating strong labor market.

### Weak Evidence:
1. **US tariff implementation timing** - While significant, these were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 concluded.
2. **Historical averages from before 2020** - Less relevant due to structural economic changes.

## Timeframe Analysis

We're forecasting Q1 2025 (January-March) from the perspective of April 24, 2025. This is a completed period awaiting official data release (expected around June 5, 2025).

Key timing considerations:
- US tariffs were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 concluded, so would not directly impact this period
- Most recent official data point is Q4 2024 at 4.80%
- Seasonal factors typically cause slight unemployment increases from Q4 to Q1

If the timeframe were shorter, we would have even less deviation from Q4 2024 data. If longer (including Q2 2025), tariff impacts would become more relevant, potentially increasing unemployment later in 2025.

## Justification

1. **Recent trend and starting point**: The Q4 2024 unemployment rate of 4.80% represents a significant improvement from earlier quarters, establishing a strong baseline.

2. **Seasonal adjustment**: Historical data shows typical small increases in unemployment from Q4 to Q1 (approximately +0.16 percentage points). Applying this to Q4 2024's 4.80% would suggest approximately 4.96% for Q1 2025.

3. **Economic growth context**: Both World Bank and IMF project strong growth for Dominican Republic in 2025 (4.0-4.021%), suggesting continued positive labor market conditions despite regional slowdown.

4. **Structural improvements**: The declining informality rate and growing formal employment indicate strengthening labor market fundamentals that should help maintain the positive trajectory.

5. **External factors timing**: The major external shock (US tariffs) was implemented in April 2025, after Q1 concluded, eliminating direct impact on this period's unemployment rate.

## Probability Calibration

The evidence points to a Q1 2025 unemployment rate most likely between 4.5% and 5.0%, with high confidence. The Q4 2024 rate of 4.80% provides a reliable anchor, with the seasonal pattern suggesting a slight increase to around 4.96%.

The strong economic growth projections and improving labor market indicators somewhat counterbalance the typical seasonal effect, making rates in the mid-to-high 4% range most probable. The "≥4.0% and ≤4.5%" range is also plausible if momentum was stronger than expected.

Rates below 4.0% would require exceptional economic performance beyond even the positive forecasts, while rates above 5.0% would represent a reversal of recent improvements without clear causation.

The tariff implementation timing is crucial - had these been implemented during Q1 rather than April, they might have pushed unemployment higher, but this was not the case.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Predicting Dominican Republic's Q1 2025 (Jan-Mar) unemployment rate based on official statistics to be released around June 5, 2025.

Forecaster 2 step 2 output: # Analysis: Dominican Republic Q1 2025 Unemployment Rate

## Source Analysis

1. **Trading Economics (recent through Q4 2024)**: Reports 4.80% unemployment for Q4 2024, down from 5.30% in Q3. Highly credible official data from Dominican Central Bank. Forecasts Q1 2025 at 4.80%, trending to 4.50% by 2026.

2. **FocusEconomics (March 2025)**: Shows declining unemployment trend (2022: 5.3%, 2023: 5.3%, 2024: 5.1%). Credible consensus forecasts from multiple analysts.

3. **World Bank Reports (April 22-24, 2025)**: Multiple articles consistently project Dominican Republic GDP growth of 4% for 2025, second highest in Latin America. Highly credible institutional analysis from very recent reports.

4. **IMF Forecasts (April 22, 2025)**: Projects Dominican Republic growth at 4.021% for 2025. Mentions potential for Caribbean economic cooldown but considers DR among strongest performers.

5. **Central Bank Labor Reports (February 2025)**: Official data showing Q4 2024 had 5,050,930 employed workers (+97,988 YoY), 4.8% open unemployment rate (SU1). Labor force participation reached record high of 62.3%.

6. **Tariff Implementation News (April 9, 2025)**: NBC and CBS reporting Trump tariffs took effect in April, with 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs except for China. Wells Fargo projects US unemployment could rise from 4% to 5%.

7. **Central Bank Governor Statement (April 21, 2025)**: Suggests Dominican Republic could see real GDP growth between 3-4%, with potential for 60,000 new jobs and unemployment decreasing to 5.4% by end-2025.

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
- **Q4 2024 unemployment at 4.8%**: Multiple reliable sources confirm this official Central Bank statistic, establishing the most recent baseline.
- **Consistent GDP growth projections for Dominican Republic**: Both World Bank and IMF independently project ~4% growth for 2025, placing DR among strongest regional performers.
- **Employment trend momentum**: Official data shows consistent improvement in labor metrics, with record participation rates and declining unemployment through 2024.

### Moderate Evidence
- **Trading Economics Q1 2025 forecast of 4.8%**: Credible model-based projection specifically for the relevant timeframe.
- **April 2025 implementation of US tariffs**: Clear policy shift occurring immediately after Q1 ended, meaning minimal direct impact on Q1 figures.
- **Seasonal patterns in Q1 unemployment**: Historical tendency for Q1 rates to be slightly higher than Q4 in the Dominican economy.

### Weak Evidence
- **US unemployment projections**: Indirect relevance to Dominican Republic, though could affect remittances and tourism.
- **Nightclub collapse disaster**: One-off event with uncertain economic impact.
- **Public perception vs. official statistics**: Anecdotal concerns about job quality rather than quantity.

## Timeframe Analysis

This forecast is for Q1 2025 (January-March 2025), which has already concluded but won't be officially reported until around June 5, 2025 (about 6 weeks from now).

If the timeframe were halved (data releasing in 3 weeks), I would place more weight on the Q4 2024 rate and Trading Economics forecast, as short-term continuity would be more likely. If doubled (12 weeks or forecasting Q2), I would increase probability in higher unemployment ranges to reflect potential tariff impacts that would materialize in Q2.

## Justification for Inside View Prediction

Starting from the outside view distribution, several key factors warrant adjustments:

1. **Most recent unemployment data points to continued strength**: The Q4 2024 rate of 4.8% represents a continued decline from 5.3% in Q3 2024. This strong momentum entering 2025 increases probability in the >4.5% and <5.0% range.

2. **Tariff timing crucial**: Trump's tariffs were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 had already ended, with a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. This means direct tariff impacts would affect Q2 and beyond, not Q1 figures.

3. **Seasonal patterns vs. economic strength**: While Q1 rates typically run slightly higher than Q4 (suggesting ~5.0-5.2%), the exceptionally strong economic growth projections (4% GDP) and continued formal employment expansion could counterbalance these seasonal effects.

4. **Trading Economics model maintains 4.8% rate**: Their projection that Q1 will hold steady at 4.8% (same as Q4) suggests they believe economic strength will offset seasonal factors.

5. **Central Bank outlook suggests continued improvement**: While noting the Governor expects unemployment to decrease to 5.4% by end-2025, this actually suggests potential for continued strong performance early in the year before global headwinds potentially accumulate.

These factors justify shifting probability from the 5.0-6.0% range toward the 4.5-5.0% range, while still acknowledging historical seasonal patterns and maintaining some probability in adjacent ranges.

## Probability Calibration

The crucial question is whether economic strength and momentum will outweigh typical seasonal patterns. The evidence suggests they likely will, but not with certainty:

- The 4.5-5.0% range should receive the highest probability, centered around the 4.8% observed in Q4 and forecast by Trading Economics.
- The 5.0-6.0% range deserves substantial probability due to historical seasonal patterns and potential early anticipatory effects from tariff announcements.
- Ranges below 4.5% remain unlikely given historical precedent, though not impossible given the strong economic performance.
- The >6.0% range is significantly less likely than in the outside view due to demonstrated economic resilience and the timing of tariff implementation.

## Checklist:
1. Forecast: Dominican Republic's Q1 2025 unemployment rate across six ranges, determined by Trading Economics around June 5, 2025.
2. Outside view base rates heavily weighted to 5.0-6.0% (60%) and 4.5-5.0% (25%).
3. Most likely: 4.5-5.0% and 5.0-6.0%; Least likely: 0-3.0% and 3.0-4.0%; aligned with evidence and justification.
4. Key evidence: Q4 2024 at 4.8%; WB/IMF projecting 4% 2025 GDP growth; April tariff implementation (post-Q1); Trading Economics forecasting 4.8% for Q1.
5. Blind spot: Significant anticipatory effects from upcoming tariffs causing Q1 hiring freezes or layoffs would push rate higher than expected.
6. Probabilities checked: between 0-100, sum to 100, no % signs.

Forecaster 3 step 2 output: Paraphrase  
We forecast the Dominican Republic’s Q1 2025 unemployment rate (to be released ~June 5, 2025) across six bins from ≤3.0% up to >6.0%.

1. Source analysis  
• Trading Economics (Central Bank data via TE) – Q4 2024 unemployment 4.80%, Q3 2024 5.30%. High-quality official stats, factual.  
• Banco Central ENCFT (Oct–Dec 2024) – 5,050,930 employed, unemployment 4.8%, labor force participation 62.3%. High quality, factual.  
• FocusEconomics (Mar 2025) – 2024 unemployment 5.1%; 2025 consensus forecasts ~5.0%. Medium-high quality, aggregated analyst forecasts (opinion).  
• Trading Economics forecasts (Apr 2025) – model projects Q1 2025 at 4.8%. Medium-high quality, econometric projection (opinion).  
• Perplexity report (AI summary) – projects 4.6–4.7% for Q1 2025. Medium quality, secondary source (opinion).  
• Atlantic Council/Oxford Economics – US reciprocal tariffs take effect April 2025; DR faces only 10% baseline. Medium-high quality, policy analysis (opinion).

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong (direct historical data, Q4 2024 = 4.80%; Q1 2024 = 5.15%; Q1 2023 = 5.23%).  
Moderate (professional forecasts & consensus ~4.6–5.2%).  
Weak (potential tariff impact arrives post-Q1; minor for Q1).

3. Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in ~1.5 months. Short timeframe ⇒ limited new surprises; distribution tight. If timeframe were much longer, uncertainties (global shocks, pandemic) would widen distribution; shorter would concentrate further around recent data.

4. Justification  
– Historical trend: steady decline from mid-2023 into Q4 2024. Q1 typically slightly above Q4 but below prior Q1.  
– Seasonality: Q1 unemployment in past two years ~5.2% and 5.15%. Given stronger momentum, expect Q1 2025 ~4.9%.  
– Expert consensus: forecasts cluster 4.6–5.0%.  
– Tariffs: enacted post-Q1, minimal DR impact in Q1.  
Conclusion: most likely bin >4.5% and <5.0%.

Probability calibration  
Base-rate anchor: Q4 2024 = 4.80% with typical quarterly volatility of ±0.3%.  
Upside factors: continued job creation, low informality, strong tourism.  
Downside factors: slight Q1 seasonality uptick, macro headwinds globally.  
I assign highest weight to >4.5–<5.0%.

Checklist  
1. Paraphrase: Predict DR Q1 2025 unemployment across bins, resolves ~June 5, 2025.  
2. Base rate: Anchored at 4.80% Q4 2024; Q1 seasonal ~5.15%; trend downward.  
3. Consistency: Most likely >4.5–<5.0; least likely ≤3.0 or >6.0—consistent.  
4. Key evidence:  
  a) Q4 2024 official 4.80% (Strong)  
  b) Q1 seasonality ~5.15% but trend improving (Strong)  
  c) Consensus forecasts 4.6–5.2% (Moderate)  
  d) Tariffs irrelevant for Q1 (Weak)  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden economic shock or data revision could push unemployment above 5%—kept modest tail on ≥5–≤6%.

Forecaster 4 step 2 output: Analysis:

1. Paraphrasing the Question  
We must forecast the Dominican Republic’s official unemployment rate for Q1 2025 (to be released ~June 5 2025) into one of six buckets:  
 ≥0–3.0%, 3.0–4.0%, 4.0–4.5%, 4.5–5.0%, 5.0–6.0%, >6.0%.

2. Outside View Base Rates  
Historical quarterly unemployment (2000–Q4 2024) clusters around 4.0–6.0%, with a long‐run mean ~6.6% (annual) and Q1 seasonal effects typically ±0.3 pp around year‐end.

3. Source Analysis  
• Trading Economics (Central Bank via TE, Apr 2025): Q4 2024 = 4.80%; TE’s Q1 2025 forecast = 4.80%. High‐quality official data; proprietary forecast of moderate transparency.  
• FocusEconomics panel (Mar 2025): Consensus 2025 annual = 5.1%. Reliable methodology; annual horizon.  
• Banco Central ENCFT (Feb 2025): Q4 2024 seasonally unadjusted unemployment = 4.8%; confirms official trend. Excellent primary source.  
• World Bank & IMF (Apr 2025 reports): Project DR 2025 GDP growth ~4.0–4.5%, implying continued job creation; flag tariff headwinds. Credible but indirect labor link.  
• News on US reciprocal tariffs (Apr 2025): Imposes 10% baseline, 90-day pauses; modest near-term drag on exports/tourism. High‐quality journalism and expert commentary.  
• Bain Capital/Oxford Econ spillover studies: U.S. tariff shock to regional growth ~–0.5 pp GDP; moderate drag on employment growth. Peer‐reviewed, credible.

4. Evidence Analysis (Weighing)  
Strong evidence:  
• Official Q4 2024 = 4.80% plus consistent Q1 seasonal uptick (~+0.1–0.3 pp).  
• Historical Q4→Q1 pattern (last five years): average move ~+0.1 pp.  
• Banco Central survey showing employment gains and lowest unemployment in series.

Moderate evidence:  
• World Bank/IMF GDP strong growth supports continued labor demand; tariff headwind adds +0.1 pp unemployment risk.  
• Trading Economics forecast of Q1 2025 = 4.80% from global models.

Weak evidence:  
• Anecdotal press reports on layoffs in U.S. federal agencies (limited spillover).  
• Tourist-sector anecdote (e.g., nightclub collapse) with limited macro labor impact.

5. Timeframe Analysis  
Forecast horizon ≈6 weeks. If horizon halved (~3 weeks), expect little change—data stale, no fresh shocks. If doubled (~12 weeks to Q2), would incorporate broader tourism season and possible tariff policy shifts—wider uncertainty, slightly heavier tails.

6. Justification  
• Baseline: Q4 2024 4.80%.  
• Seasonality: modest rise into Q1 historically +0.1–0.3 pp → baseline ~4.9%.  
• Trend: recent secular decline Q3→Q4 (5.26→4.80) unlikely to repeat fully into Q1; trend effect ~0.0 pp.  
• External shock: U.S. reciprocal tariffs and global slowdown add +0.1–0.2 pp risk.  
Net midpoint ~5.0%, central in (4.5–5.0)% bucket.  

Buckets ranking:  
Most likely = >4.5–5.0%; next = 4.0–4.5% and 5.0–6.0%; extremes (<4.0 or >6.0) highly unlikely.

Probability Calibration  
• ≥0–3.0%: 1% (historically never that low)  
• >3.0–4.0%: 2% (only Q2 2020 hit 3.2%)  
• ≥4.0–4.5%: 17% (could undershoot seasonally)  
• >4.5–5.0%: 56% (central scenario)  
• ≥5.0–6.0%: 23% (upside from tariffs or weaker tourism)  
• >6.0%: 1% (extreme shock only)

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase ✔  
2. Base rates stated ✔  
3. Consistency: most likely >4.5–5.0; least likely <4.0, >6.0 ✔  
4. Key evidence (official Q4, seasonal pattern, tariff headwinds, GDP growth) ✔  
5. Blind spot: sudden domestic policy change (e.g., massive fiscal stimulus hiring) could drive unemployment below 4.5%; probability low → small shift.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong
• Central Bank Q4-2024 unemployment = 4.8 % (primary data).  
• Historical quarter-to-quarter volatility ≤ ±0.7 pp 82 % of time since 2006.

Moderate
• Trading Economics forecast 4.8 % for Q1-2025 (model & analyst consensus).  
• World Bank & IMF still expect solid DR growth (~4 %) despite headwinds.  
• 10 % blanket U.S. tariff could trim export-factory hours but effect lags.

Weak
• Public perception articles; nightclub accident; speculative hurricane risk.  
• Allianz/Wells Fargo remarks on U.S. unemployment (indirect channel).

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days to release ≈ 42 (6 weeks).  If the horizon were halved (21 days) I would narrow the inter-bin spread by ~2 pp (less time for surprises).  Doubling to 84 days would widen the tails by ~5 pp, mostly to the ≥5 % bin, to cover a longer window for negative external shocks.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Baseline (outside view):

Shifters

+ Seasonal tourist peak in Q1 usually shaves ~0.1 pp. (moderate)  
+ Record employment momentum into Dec 2024, wage gains 7 % real. (strong)  
– Mean-reversion: after a 0.5 pp drop Q3→Q4, slight bounce common. (moderate)  
– U.S. tariff noise; however only 10 % layer active and paused after 90 days, so minimal Q1 impact. (weak-to-moderate)  
± Macro forecasts (FocusEconomics 5 % annual) roughly match base. (neutral)

Net: small downward tilt from the ≥5 % bucket into the 4.0-4.9 % buckets.  Tail bins unchanged.

## Source Analysis

### Official Data Sources:
- **Trading Economics (Q4 2024 data)**: 4.80% unemployment rate, down from 5.30% in Q3 2024. High reliability with official Central Bank figures. Forecasts unemployment trending toward 4.50% by 2026. 

- **FocusEconomics (March 27, 2025)**: Reports 2024 unemployment at 5.1%, down from 5.3% in 2022-2023. Historical context shows 2013-2022 average of 6.6%. Reliable economic research with transparent methodology.

### International Institution Reports:
- **World Bank (April 23-24, 2025)**: Projects 4% GDP growth for Dominican Republic in 2025, second highest in region behind Argentina. Multiple news outlets consistently report this figure. High-quality projection from authoritative institution.

- **IMF (April 22, 2025)**: Forecasts 4.021% GDP growth for Dominican Republic in 2025. Multiple sources confirm these figures. Reduced regional forecasts due to trade tensions, but still positive for Dominican Republic.

### Labor Market Statistics:
- **Central Bank Report (February 2025)**: Shows employment reached 5,050,930 workers in Q4 2024, adding 97,988 jobs year-over-year. Formal employment increased by 140,669 while informal employment decreased by 42,681. Unemployment at record low 4.8% in Q4 2024. Official government statistics.

### US Tariff Impact Analysis:
- **News reports (April 9, 2025)**: Trump's reciprocal tariffs implemented in April 2025, with baseline 10% tariff on imports from countries including Dominican Republic. Analysis from Wells Fargo suggests US unemployment could rise from 4% to 5%. Factual reporting with expert opinions.

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
1. **Q4 2024 unemployment rate at 4.80%** - Official Central Bank data showing most recent figure with improving trend from Q3 (5.30%).
2. **Record employment levels and formal job growth** - 140,669 new formal jobs added with reduced informality rate to 54.8%, showing structural improvement.
3. **Consistent economic growth forecasts** - Both World Bank and IMF projecting ~4% growth for 2025, significantly above regional average.

### Moderate Evidence:
1. **Historical seasonal patterns** - Q1 unemployment typically shows slight increases over Q4 figures (e.g., Q4 2023 to Q1 2024: +0.16 percentage points).
2. **Trading Economics forecast trend** - Projections show unemployment continuing toward 4.5% by 2026.
3. **Labor earnings improvements** - 10.1% nominal and 7.1% real wage increases reported, indicating strong labor market.

### Weak Evidence:
1. **US tariff implementation timing** - While significant, these were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 concluded.
2. **Historical averages from before 2020** - Less relevant due to structural economic changes.

## Timeframe Analysis

We're forecasting Q1 2025 (January-March) from the perspective of April 24, 2025. This is a completed period awaiting official data release (expected around June 5, 2025).

Key timing considerations:
- US tariffs were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 concluded, so would not directly impact this period
- Most recent official data point is Q4 2024 at 4.80%
- Seasonal factors typically cause slight unemployment increases from Q4 to Q1

If the timeframe were shorter, we would have even less deviation from Q4 2024 data. If longer (including Q2 2025), tariff impacts would become more relevant, potentially increasing unemployment later in 2025.

## Justification

1. **Recent trend and starting point**: The Q4 2024 unemployment rate of 4.80% represents a significant improvement from earlier quarters, establishing a strong baseline.

2. **Seasonal adjustment**: Historical data shows typical small increases in unemployment from Q4 to Q1 (approximately +0.16 percentage points). Applying this to Q4 2024's 4.80% would suggest approximately 4.96% for Q1 2025.

3. **Economic growth context**: Both World Bank and IMF project strong growth for Dominican Republic in 2025 (4.0-4.021%), suggesting continued positive labor market conditions despite regional slowdown.

4. **Structural improvements**: The declining informality rate and growing formal employment indicate strengthening labor market fundamentals that should help maintain the positive trajectory.

5. **External factors timing**: The major external shock (US tariffs) was implemented in April 2025, after Q1 concluded, eliminating direct impact on this period's unemployment rate.

## Probability Calibration

The evidence points to a Q1 2025 unemployment rate most likely between 4.5% and 5.0%, with high confidence. The Q4 2024 rate of 4.80% provides a reliable anchor, with the seasonal pattern suggesting a slight increase to around 4.96%.

The strong economic growth projections and improving labor market indicators somewhat counterbalance the typical seasonal effect, making rates in the mid-to-high 4% range most probable. The "≥4.0% and ≤4.5%" range is also plausible if momentum was stronger than expected.

Rates below 4.0% would require exceptional economic performance beyond even the positive forecasts, while rates above 5.0% would represent a reversal of recent improvements without clear causation.

The tariff implementation timing is crucial - had these been implemented during Q1 rather than April, they might have pushed unemployment higher, but this was not the case.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Predicting Dominican Republic's Q1 2025 (Jan-Mar) unemployment rate based on official statistics to be released around June 5, 2025.

2. **Outside view**: Recent quarters showed 4.8-5.3% unemployment with downward trend; Q4 2024 at 4.80%; seasonal patterns suggest slight Q1 increase.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = >4.5% and <5.0%; Least likely = ≥0% and ≤3.0% and >6.0%; aligns with recent data and forecasts.

4. **Key evidence**: (1) Q4 2024 unemployment at 4.8% (official data); (2) Typical Q4-to-Q1 seasonal increase ~0.16pp; (3) Strong 4% GDP growth forecasts; (4) Tariffs implemented after Q1 ended.

5. **Blind spot**: Unreported domestic economic shock specific to Dominican Republic in early 2025 or methodological change in unemployment calculation.

7. **Central Bank Governor Statement (April 21, 2025)**: Suggests Dominican Republic could see real GDP growth between 3-4%, with potential for 60,000 new jobs and unemployment decreasing to 5.4% by end-2025.

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
- **Q4 2024 unemployment at 4.8%**: Multiple reliable sources confirm this official Central Bank statistic, establishing the most recent baseline.
- **Consistent GDP growth projections for Dominican Republic**: Both World Bank and IMF independently project ~4% growth for 2025, placing DR among strongest regional performers.
- **Employment trend momentum**: Official data shows consistent improvement in labor metrics, with record participation rates and declining unemployment through 2024.

### Moderate Evidence
- **Trading Economics Q1 2025 forecast of 4.8%**: Credible model-based projection specifically for the relevant timeframe.
- **April 2025 implementation of US tariffs**: Clear policy shift occurring immediately after Q1 ended, meaning minimal direct impact on Q1 figures.
- **Seasonal patterns in Q1 unemployment**: Historical tendency for Q1 rates to be slightly higher than Q4 in the Dominican economy.

### Weak Evidence
- **US unemployment projections**: Indirect relevance to Dominican Republic, though could affect remittances and tourism.
- **Nightclub collapse disaster**: One-off event with uncertain economic impact.
- **Public perception vs. official statistics**: Anecdotal concerns about job quality rather than quantity.

## Timeframe Analysis

This forecast is for Q1 2025 (January-March 2025), which has already concluded but won't be officially reported until around June 5, 2025 (about 6 weeks from now).

If the timeframe were halved (data releasing in 3 weeks), I would place more weight on the Q4 2024 rate and Trading Economics forecast, as short-term continuity would be more likely. If doubled (12 weeks or forecasting Q2), I would increase probability in higher unemployment ranges to reflect potential tariff impacts that would materialize in Q2.

## Justification for Inside View Prediction

Starting from the outside view distribution, several key factors warrant adjustments:

1. **Most recent unemployment data points to continued strength**: The Q4 2024 rate of 4.8% represents a continued decline from 5.3% in Q3 2024. This strong momentum entering 2025 increases probability in the >4.5% and <5.0% range.

2. **Tariff timing crucial**: Trump's tariffs were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 had already ended, with a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. This means direct tariff impacts would affect Q2 and beyond, not Q1 figures.

3. **Seasonal patterns vs. economic strength**: While Q1 rates typically run slightly higher than Q4 (suggesting ~5.0-5.2%), the exceptionally strong economic growth projections (4% GDP) and continued formal employment expansion could counterbalance these seasonal effects.

4. **Trading Economics model maintains 4.8% rate**: Their projection that Q1 will hold steady at 4.8% (same as Q4) suggests they believe economic strength will offset seasonal factors.

5. **Central Bank outlook suggests continued improvement**: While noting the Governor expects unemployment to decrease to 5.4% by end-2025, this actually suggests potential for continued strong performance early in the year before global headwinds potentially accumulate.

These factors justify shifting probability from the 5.0-6.0% range toward the 4.5-5.0% range, while still acknowledging historical seasonal patterns and maintaining some probability in adjacent ranges.

## Probability Calibration

The crucial question is whether economic strength and momentum will outweigh typical seasonal patterns. The evidence suggests they likely will, but not with certainty:

- The 4.5-5.0% range should receive the highest probability, centered around the 4.8% observed in Q4 and forecast by Trading Economics.
- The 5.0-6.0% range deserves substantial probability due to historical seasonal patterns and potential early anticipatory effects from tariff announcements.
- Ranges below 4.5% remain unlikely given historical precedent, though not impossible given the strong economic performance.
- The >6.0% range is significantly less likely than in the outside view due to demonstrated economic resilience and the timing of tariff implementation.

## Checklist:
1. Forecast: Dominican Republic's Q1 2025 unemployment rate across six ranges, determined by Trading Economics around June 5, 2025.
2. Outside view base rates heavily weighted to 5.0-6.0% (60%) and 4.5-5.0% (25%).
3. Most likely: 4.5-5.0% and 5.0-6.0%; Least likely: 0-3.0% and 3.0-4.0%; aligned with evidence and justification.
4. Key evidence: Q4 2024 at 4.8%; WB/IMF projecting 4% 2025 GDP growth; April tariff implementation (post-Q1); Trading Economics forecasting 4.8% for Q1.
5. Blind spot: Significant anticipatory effects from upcoming tariffs causing Q1 hiring freezes or layoffs would push rate higher than expected.
6. Probabilities checked: between 0-100, sum to 100, no % signs.

Paraphrase  
We forecast the Dominican Republic’s Q1 2025 unemployment rate (to be released ~June 5, 2025) across six bins from ≤3.0% up to >6.0%.

1. Source analysis  
• Trading Economics (Central Bank data via TE) – Q4 2024 unemployment 4.80%, Q3 2024 5.30%. High-quality official stats, factual.  
• Banco Central ENCFT (Oct–Dec 2024) – 5,050,930 employed, unemployment 4.8%, labor force participation 62.3%. High quality, factual.  
• FocusEconomics (Mar 2025) – 2024 unemployment 5.1%; 2025 consensus forecasts ~5.0%. Medium-high quality, aggregated analyst forecasts (opinion).  
• Trading Economics forecasts (Apr 2025) – model projects Q1 2025 at 4.8%. Medium-high quality, econometric projection (opinion).  
• Perplexity report (AI summary) – projects 4.6–4.7% for Q1 2025. Medium quality, secondary source (opinion).  
• Atlantic Council/Oxford Economics – US reciprocal tariffs take effect April 2025; DR faces only 10% baseline. Medium-high quality, policy analysis (opinion).

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong (direct historical data, Q4 2024 = 4.80%; Q1 2024 = 5.15%; Q1 2023 = 5.23%).  
Moderate (professional forecasts & consensus ~4.6–5.2%).  
Weak (potential tariff impact arrives post-Q1; minor for Q1).

3. Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in ~1.5 months. Short timeframe ⇒ limited new surprises; distribution tight. If timeframe were much longer, uncertainties (global shocks, pandemic) would widen distribution; shorter would concentrate further around recent data.

4. Justification  
– Historical trend: steady decline from mid-2023 into Q4 2024. Q1 typically slightly above Q4 but below prior Q1.  
– Seasonality: Q1 unemployment in past two years ~5.2% and 5.15%. Given stronger momentum, expect Q1 2025 ~4.9%.  
– Expert consensus: forecasts cluster 4.6–5.0%.  
– Tariffs: enacted post-Q1, minimal DR impact in Q1.  
Conclusion: most likely bin >4.5% and <5.0%.

Probability calibration  
Base-rate anchor: Q4 2024 = 4.80% with typical quarterly volatility of ±0.3%.  
Upside factors: continued job creation, low informality, strong tourism.  
Downside factors: slight Q1 seasonality uptick, macro headwinds globally.  
I assign highest weight to >4.5–<5.0%.

Checklist  
1. Paraphrase: Predict DR Q1 2025 unemployment across bins, resolves ~June 5, 2025.  
2. Base rate: Anchored at 4.80% Q4 2024; Q1 seasonal ~5.15%; trend downward.  
3. Consistency: Most likely >4.5–<5.0; least likely ≤3.0 or >6.0—consistent.  
4. Key evidence:  
  a) Q4 2024 official 4.80% (Strong)  
  b) Q1 seasonality ~5.15% but trend improving (Strong)  
  c) Consensus forecasts 4.6–5.2% (Moderate)  
  d) Tariffs irrelevant for Q1 (Weak)  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden economic shock or data revision could push unemployment above 5%—kept modest tail on ≥5–≤6%.  
6. Technicalities: Probabilities sum to 100, each between 0–100.

Analysis:

1. Paraphrasing the Question  
We must forecast the Dominican Republic’s official unemployment rate for Q1 2025 (to be released ~June 5 2025) into one of six buckets:  
 ≥0–3.0%, 3.0–4.0%, 4.0–4.5%, 4.5–5.0%, 5.0–6.0%, >6.0%.

2. Outside View Base Rates  
Historical quarterly unemployment (2000–Q4 2024) clusters around 4.0–6.0%, with a long‐run mean ~6.6% (annual) and Q1 seasonal effects typically ±0.3 pp around year‐end.

3. Source Analysis  
• Trading Economics (Central Bank via TE, Apr 2025): Q4 2024 = 4.80%; TE’s Q1 2025 forecast = 4.80%. High‐quality official data; proprietary forecast of moderate transparency.  
• FocusEconomics panel (Mar 2025): Consensus 2025 annual = 5.1%. Reliable methodology; annual horizon.  
• Banco Central ENCFT (Feb 2025): Q4 2024 seasonally unadjusted unemployment = 4.8%; confirms official trend. Excellent primary source.  
• World Bank & IMF (Apr 2025 reports): Project DR 2025 GDP growth ~4.0–4.5%, implying continued job creation; flag tariff headwinds. Credible but indirect labor link.  
• News on US reciprocal tariffs (Apr 2025): Imposes 10% baseline, 90-day pauses; modest near-term drag on exports/tourism. High‐quality journalism and expert commentary.  
• Bain Capital/Oxford Econ spillover studies: U.S. tariff shock to regional growth ~–0.5 pp GDP; moderate drag on employment growth. Peer‐reviewed, credible.

4. Evidence Analysis (Weighing)  
Strong evidence:  
• Official Q4 2024 = 4.80% plus consistent Q1 seasonal uptick (~+0.1–0.3 pp).  
• Historical Q4→Q1 pattern (last five years): average move ~+0.1 pp.  
• Banco Central survey showing employment gains and lowest unemployment in series.

Moderate evidence:  
• World Bank/IMF GDP strong growth supports continued labor demand; tariff headwind adds +0.1 pp unemployment risk.  
• Trading Economics forecast of Q1 2025 = 4.80% from global models.

Weak evidence:  
• Anecdotal press reports on layoffs in U.S. federal agencies (limited spillover).  
• Tourist-sector anecdote (e.g., nightclub collapse) with limited macro labor impact.

5. Timeframe Analysis  
Forecast horizon ≈6 weeks. If horizon halved (~3 weeks), expect little change—data stale, no fresh shocks. If doubled (~12 weeks to Q2), would incorporate broader tourism season and possible tariff policy shifts—wider uncertainty, slightly heavier tails.

6. Justification  
• Baseline: Q4 2024 4.80%.  
• Seasonality: modest rise into Q1 historically +0.1–0.3 pp → baseline ~4.9%.  
• Trend: recent secular decline Q3→Q4 (5.26→4.80) unlikely to repeat fully into Q1; trend effect ~0.0 pp.  
• External shock: U.S. reciprocal tariffs and global slowdown add +0.1–0.2 pp risk.  
Net midpoint ~5.0%, central in (4.5–5.0)% bucket.  

Buckets ranking:  
Most likely = >4.5–5.0%; next = 4.0–4.5% and 5.0–6.0%; extremes (<4.0 or >6.0) highly unlikely.

Probability Calibration  
• ≥0–3.0%: 1% (historically never that low)  
• >3.0–4.0%: 2% (only Q2 2020 hit 3.2%)  
• ≥4.0–4.5%: 17% (could undershoot seasonally)  
• >4.5–5.0%: 56% (central scenario)  
• ≥5.0–6.0%: 23% (upside from tariffs or weaker tourism)  
• >6.0%: 1% (extreme shock only)

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase ✔  
2. Base rates stated ✔  
3. Consistency: most likely >4.5–5.0; least likely <4.0, >6.0 ✔  
4. Key evidence (official Q4, seasonal pattern, tariff headwinds, GDP growth) ✔  
5. Blind spot: sudden domestic policy change (e.g., massive fiscal stimulus hiring) could drive unemployment below 4.5%; probability low → small shift.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, between 0–100 ✔

Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, condensed)

1. Central Bank ENCFT bulletin (12-13 Feb 2025, Spanish press).  Primary micro-survey data for Q4-2024: unemployment 4.8 %, record employment.  High-quality, factual, no opinions.

2. Trading Economics unemployment page & forecast table (update Mar 2025).  Repeats the Central Bank series; adds model forecast 4.8 % for Q1-2025.  History = facts, forecast = informed opinion, medium quality.

3. FocusEconomics consensus (27 Mar 2025).  Panel average, yearly horizon; 2024 = 5.1 %, 2025 ≈ 5.0 %.  Method transparent, good but annual—not quarterly—metric.

4. World Bank Latin-America spring report (23-24 Apr 2025).  Projects DR GDP ≈ 4 % 2025; flags regional headwinds.  Reliable institution; employment implications indirect.

5. NBC / CBS tariff stories (9 Apr 2025).  Hard news on 10 % baseline U.S. tariff and 90-day pause on “reciprocal” layer.  Factual; economic remarks are expert quotes (Moody’s, Wells Fargo).  Relevance: possible medium-term drag.

6. ODI / Atlantic Council / IMF pieces on global trade tension (22 Apr 2025 etc.).  Expert commentary; directionally negative for growth; timing uncertain.  Moderate quality, indirect.

7. Dominican press (Acento, Listín Diario, Apr–Feb 2025).  Local analysts repeat Central Bank numbers, note public perception gap.  Main value: no contradictory evidence to 4.8 % Q4 print.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong
• Central Bank Q4-2024 unemployment = 4.8 % (primary data).  
• Historical quarter-to-quarter volatility ≤ ±0.7 pp 82 % of time since 2006.

Moderate
• Trading Economics forecast 4.8 % for Q1-2025 (model & analyst consensus).  
• World Bank & IMF still expect solid DR growth (~4 %) despite headwinds.  
• 10 % blanket U.S. tariff could trim export-factory hours but effect lags.

Weak
• Public perception articles; nightclub accident; speculative hurricane risk.  
• Allianz/Wells Fargo remarks on U.S. unemployment (indirect channel).

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days to release ≈ 42 (6 weeks).  If the horizon were halved (21 days) I would narrow the inter-bin spread by ~2 pp (less time for surprises).  Doubling to 84 days would widen the tails by ~5 pp, mostly to the ≥5 % bin, to cover a longer window for negative external shocks.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Baseline (outside view):
[1, 4, 15, 35, 40, 5]

Shifters

+ Seasonal tourist peak in Q1 usually shaves ~0.1 pp. (moderate)  
+ Record employment momentum into Dec 2024, wage gains 7 % real. (strong)  
– Mean-reversion: after a 0.5 pp drop Q3→Q4, slight bounce common. (moderate)  
– U.S. tariff noise; however only 10 % layer active and paused after 90 days, so minimal Q1 impact. (weak-to-moderate)  
± Macro forecasts (FocusEconomics 5 % annual) roughly match base. (neutral)

Net: small downward tilt from the ≥5 % bucket into the 4.0-4.9 % buckets.  Tail bins unchanged.

# Analysis

## Source Analysis

### Official Data Sources:
- **Trading Economics (Q4 2024 data)**: 4.80% unemployment rate, down from 5.30% in Q3 2024. High reliability with official Central Bank figures. Forecasts unemployment trending toward 4.50% by 2026. 

- **FocusEconomics (March 27, 2025)**: Reports 2024 unemployment at 5.1%, down from 5.3% in 2022-2023. Historical context shows 2013-2022 average of 6.6%. Reliable economic research with transparent methodology.

### International Institution Reports:
- **World Bank (April 23-24, 2025)**: Projects 4% GDP growth for Dominican Republic in 2025, second highest in region behind Argentina. Multiple news outlets consistently report this figure. High-quality projection from authoritative institution.

- **IMF (April 22, 2025)**: Forecasts 4.021% GDP growth for Dominican Republic in 2025. Multiple sources confirm these figures. Reduced regional forecasts due to trade tensions, but still positive for Dominican Republic.

### Labor Market Statistics:
- **Central Bank Report (February 2025)**: Shows employment reached 5,050,930 workers in Q4 2024, adding 97,988 jobs year-over-year. Formal employment increased by 140,669 while informal employment decreased by 42,681. Unemployment at record low 4.8% in Q4 2024. Official government statistics.

### US Tariff Impact Analysis:
- **News reports (April 9, 2025)**: Trump's reciprocal tariffs implemented in April 2025, with baseline 10% tariff on imports from countries including Dominican Republic. Analysis from Wells Fargo suggests US unemployment could rise from 4% to 5%. Factual reporting with expert opinions.

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
1. **Q4 2024 unemployment rate at 4.80%** - Official Central Bank data showing most recent figure with improving trend from Q3 (5.30%).
2. **Record employment levels and formal job growth** - 140,669 new formal jobs added with reduced informality rate to 54.8%, showing structural improvement.
3. **Consistent economic growth forecasts** - Both World Bank and IMF projecting ~4% growth for 2025, significantly above regional average.

### Moderate Evidence:
1. **Historical seasonal patterns** - Q1 unemployment typically shows slight increases over Q4 figures (e.g., Q4 2023 to Q1 2024: +0.16 percentage points).
2. **Trading Economics forecast trend** - Projections show unemployment continuing toward 4.5% by 2026.
3. **Labor earnings improvements** - 10.1% nominal and 7.1% real wage increases reported, indicating strong labor market.

### Weak Evidence:
1. **US tariff implementation timing** - While significant, these were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 concluded.
2. **Historical averages from before 2020** - Less relevant due to structural economic changes.

## Timeframe Analysis

We're forecasting Q1 2025 (January-March) from the perspective of April 24, 2025. This is a completed period awaiting official data release (expected around June 5, 2025).

Key timing considerations:
- US tariffs were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 concluded, so would not directly impact this period
- Most recent official data point is Q4 2024 at 4.80%
- Seasonal factors typically cause slight unemployment increases from Q4 to Q1

If the timeframe were shorter, we would have even less deviation from Q4 2024 data. If longer (including Q2 2025), tariff impacts would become more relevant, potentially increasing unemployment later in 2025.

## Justification

1. **Recent trend and starting point**: The Q4 2024 unemployment rate of 4.80% represents a significant improvement from earlier quarters, establishing a strong baseline.

2. **Seasonal adjustment**: Historical data shows typical small increases in unemployment from Q4 to Q1 (approximately +0.16 percentage points). Applying this to Q4 2024's 4.80% would suggest approximately 4.96% for Q1 2025.

3. **Economic growth context**: Both World Bank and IMF project strong growth for Dominican Republic in 2025 (4.0-4.021%), suggesting continued positive labor market conditions despite regional slowdown.

4. **Structural improvements**: The declining informality rate and growing formal employment indicate strengthening labor market fundamentals that should help maintain the positive trajectory.

5. **External factors timing**: The major external shock (US tariffs) was implemented in April 2025, after Q1 concluded, eliminating direct impact on this period's unemployment rate.

## Probability Calibration

The evidence points to a Q1 2025 unemployment rate most likely between 4.5% and 5.0%, with high confidence. The Q4 2024 rate of 4.80% provides a reliable anchor, with the seasonal pattern suggesting a slight increase to around 4.96%.

The strong economic growth projections and improving labor market indicators somewhat counterbalance the typical seasonal effect, making rates in the mid-to-high 4% range most probable. The "≥4.0% and ≤4.5%" range is also plausible if momentum was stronger than expected.

Rates below 4.0% would require exceptional economic performance beyond even the positive forecasts, while rates above 5.0% would represent a reversal of recent improvements without clear causation.

The tariff implementation timing is crucial - had these been implemented during Q1 rather than April, they might have pushed unemployment higher, but this was not the case.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Predicting Dominican Republic's Q1 2025 (Jan-Mar) unemployment rate based on official statistics to be released around June 5, 2025.

2. **Outside view**: Recent quarters showed 4.8-5.3% unemployment with downward trend; Q4 2024 at 4.80%; seasonal patterns suggest slight Q1 increase.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = >4.5% and <5.0%; Least likely = ≥0% and ≤3.0% and >6.0%; aligns with recent data and forecasts.

4. **Key evidence**: (1) Q4 2024 unemployment at 4.8% (official data); (2) Typical Q4-to-Q1 seasonal increase ~0.16pp; (3) Strong 4% GDP growth forecasts; (4) Tariffs implemented after Q1 ended.

5. **Blind spot**: Unreported domestic economic shock specific to Dominican Republic in early 2025 or methodological change in unemployment calculation.

# Analysis: Dominican Republic Q1 2025 Unemployment Rate

## Source Analysis

1. **Trading Economics (recent through Q4 2024)**: Reports 4.80% unemployment for Q4 2024, down from 5.30% in Q3. Highly credible official data from Dominican Central Bank. Forecasts Q1 2025 at 4.80%, trending to 4.50% by 2026.

2. **FocusEconomics (March 2025)**: Shows declining unemployment trend (2022: 5.3%, 2023: 5.3%, 2024: 5.1%). Credible consensus forecasts from multiple analysts.

3. **World Bank Reports (April 22-24, 2025)**: Multiple articles consistently project Dominican Republic GDP growth of 4% for 2025, second highest in Latin America. Highly credible institutional analysis from very recent reports.

4. **IMF Forecasts (April 22, 2025)**: Projects Dominican Republic growth at 4.021% for 2025. Mentions potential for Caribbean economic cooldown but considers DR among strongest performers.

5. **Central Bank Labor Reports (February 2025)**: Official data showing Q4 2024 had 5,050,930 employed workers (+97,988 YoY), 4.8% open unemployment rate (SU1). Labor force participation reached record high of 62.3%.

6. **Tariff Implementation News (April 9, 2025)**: NBC and CBS reporting Trump tariffs took effect in April, with 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs except for China. Wells Fargo projects US unemployment could rise from 4% to 5%.

7. **Central Bank Governor Statement (April 21, 2025)**: Suggests Dominican Republic could see real GDP growth between 3-4%, with potential for 60,000 new jobs and unemployment decreasing to 5.4% by end-2025.

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
- **Q4 2024 unemployment at 4.8%**: Multiple reliable sources confirm this official Central Bank statistic, establishing the most recent baseline.
- **Consistent GDP growth projections for Dominican Republic**: Both World Bank and IMF independently project ~4% growth for 2025, placing DR among strongest regional performers.
- **Employment trend momentum**: Official data shows consistent improvement in labor metrics, with record participation rates and declining unemployment through 2024.

### Moderate Evidence
- **Trading Economics Q1 2025 forecast of 4.8%**: Credible model-based projection specifically for the relevant timeframe.
- **April 2025 implementation of US tariffs**: Clear policy shift occurring immediately after Q1 ended, meaning minimal direct impact on Q1 figures.
- **Seasonal patterns in Q1 unemployment**: Historical tendency for Q1 rates to be slightly higher than Q4 in the Dominican economy.

### Weak Evidence
- **US unemployment projections**: Indirect relevance to Dominican Republic, though could affect remittances and tourism.
- **Nightclub collapse disaster**: One-off event with uncertain economic impact.
- **Public perception vs. official statistics**: Anecdotal concerns about job quality rather than quantity.

## Timeframe Analysis

This forecast is for Q1 2025 (January-March 2025), which has already concluded but won't be officially reported until around June 5, 2025 (about 6 weeks from now).

If the timeframe were halved (data releasing in 3 weeks), I would place more weight on the Q4 2024 rate and Trading Economics forecast, as short-term continuity would be more likely. If doubled (12 weeks or forecasting Q2), I would increase probability in higher unemployment ranges to reflect potential tariff impacts that would materialize in Q2.

## Justification for Inside View Prediction

Starting from the outside view distribution, several key factors warrant adjustments:

1. **Most recent unemployment data points to continued strength**: The Q4 2024 rate of 4.8% represents a continued decline from 5.3% in Q3 2024. This strong momentum entering 2025 increases probability in the >4.5% and <5.0% range.

2. **Tariff timing crucial**: Trump's tariffs were implemented in April 2025, after Q1 had already ended, with a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. This means direct tariff impacts would affect Q2 and beyond, not Q1 figures.

3. **Seasonal patterns vs. economic strength**: While Q1 rates typically run slightly higher than Q4 (suggesting ~5.0-5.2%), the exceptionally strong economic growth projections (4% GDP) and continued formal employment expansion could counterbalance these seasonal effects.

4. **Trading Economics model maintains 4.8% rate**: Their projection that Q1 will hold steady at 4.8% (same as Q4) suggests they believe economic strength will offset seasonal factors.

5. **Central Bank outlook suggests continued improvement**: While noting the Governor expects unemployment to decrease to 5.4% by end-2025, this actually suggests potential for continued strong performance early in the year before global headwinds potentially accumulate.

These factors justify shifting probability from the 5.0-6.0% range toward the 4.5-5.0% range, while still acknowledging historical seasonal patterns and maintaining some probability in adjacent ranges.

## Probability Calibration

The crucial question is whether economic strength and momentum will outweigh typical seasonal patterns. The evidence suggests they likely will, but not with certainty:

- The 4.5-5.0% range should receive the highest probability, centered around the 4.8% observed in Q4 and forecast by Trading Economics.
- The 5.0-6.0% range deserves substantial probability due to historical seasonal patterns and potential early anticipatory effects from tariff announcements.
- Ranges below 4.5% remain unlikely given historical precedent, though not impossible given the strong economic performance.
- The >6.0% range is significantly less likely than in the outside view due to demonstrated economic resilience and the timing of tariff implementation.

## Checklist:
1. Forecast: Dominican Republic's Q1 2025 unemployment rate across six ranges, determined by Trading Economics around June 5, 2025.
2. Outside view base rates heavily weighted to 5.0-6.0% (60%) and 4.5-5.0% (25%).
3. Most likely: 4.5-5.0% and 5.0-6.0%; Least likely: 0-3.0% and 3.0-4.0%; aligned with evidence and justification.
4. Key evidence: Q4 2024 at 4.8%; WB/IMF projecting 4% 2025 GDP growth; April tariff implementation (post-Q1); Trading Economics forecasting 4.8% for Q1.
5. Blind spot: Significant anticipatory effects from upcoming tariffs causing Q1 hiring freezes or layoffs would push rate higher than expected.
6. Probabilities checked: between 0-100, sum to 100, no % signs.

Paraphrase  
We forecast the Dominican Republic’s Q1 2025 unemployment rate (to be released ~June 5, 2025) across six bins from ≤3.0% up to >6.0%.

1. Source analysis  
• Trading Economics (Central Bank data via TE) – Q4 2024 unemployment 4.80%, Q3 2024 5.30%. High-quality official stats, factual.  
• Banco Central ENCFT (Oct–Dec 2024) – 5,050,930 employed, unemployment 4.8%, labor force participation 62.3%. High quality, factual.  
• FocusEconomics (Mar 2025) – 2024 unemployment 5.1%; 2025 consensus forecasts ~5.0%. Medium-high quality, aggregated analyst forecasts (opinion).  
• Trading Economics forecasts (Apr 2025) – model projects Q1 2025 at 4.8%. Medium-high quality, econometric projection (opinion).  
• Perplexity report (AI summary) – projects 4.6–4.7% for Q1 2025. Medium quality, secondary source (opinion).  
• Atlantic Council/Oxford Economics – US reciprocal tariffs take effect April 2025; DR faces only 10% baseline. Medium-high quality, policy analysis (opinion).

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong (direct historical data, Q4 2024 = 4.80%; Q1 2024 = 5.15%; Q1 2023 = 5.23%).  
Moderate (professional forecasts & consensus ~4.6–5.2%).  
Weak (potential tariff impact arrives post-Q1; minor for Q1).

3. Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in ~1.5 months. Short timeframe ⇒ limited new surprises; distribution tight. If timeframe were much longer, uncertainties (global shocks, pandemic) would widen distribution; shorter would concentrate further around recent data.

4. Justification  
– Historical trend: steady decline from mid-2023 into Q4 2024. Q1 typically slightly above Q4 but below prior Q1.  
– Seasonality: Q1 unemployment in past two years ~5.2% and 5.15%. Given stronger momentum, expect Q1 2025 ~4.9%.  
– Expert consensus: forecasts cluster 4.6–5.0%.  
– Tariffs: enacted post-Q1, minimal DR impact in Q1.  
Conclusion: most likely bin >4.5% and <5.0%.

Probability calibration  
Base-rate anchor: Q4 2024 = 4.80% with typical quarterly volatility of ±0.3%.  
Upside factors: continued job creation, low informality, strong tourism.  
Downside factors: slight Q1 seasonality uptick, macro headwinds globally.  
I assign highest weight to >4.5–<5.0%.

Checklist  
1. Paraphrase: Predict DR Q1 2025 unemployment across bins, resolves ~June 5, 2025.  
2. Base rate: Anchored at 4.80% Q4 2024; Q1 seasonal ~5.15%; trend downward.  
3. Consistency: Most likely >4.5–<5.0; least likely ≤3.0 or >6.0—consistent.  
4. Key evidence:  
  a) Q4 2024 official 4.80% (Strong)  
  b) Q1 seasonality ~5.15% but trend improving (Strong)  
  c) Consensus forecasts 4.6–5.2% (Moderate)  
  d) Tariffs irrelevant for Q1 (Weak)  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden economic shock or data revision could push unemployment above 5%—kept modest tail on ≥5–≤6%.  
6. Technicalities: Probabilities sum to 100, each between 0–100.

Probabilities: [1, 4, 20, 55, 18, 2]

Analysis:

1. Paraphrasing the Question  
We must forecast the Dominican Republic’s official unemployment rate for Q1 2025 (to be released ~June 5 2025) into one of six buckets:  
 ≥0–3.0%, 3.0–4.0%, 4.0–4.5%, 4.5–5.0%, 5.0–6.0%, >6.0%.

2. Outside View Base Rates  
Historical quarterly unemployment (2000–Q4 2024) clusters around 4.0–6.0%, with a long‐run mean ~6.6% (annual) and Q1 seasonal effects typically ±0.3 pp around year‐end.

3. Source Analysis  
• Trading Economics (Central Bank via TE, Apr 2025): Q4 2024 = 4.80%; TE’s Q1 2025 forecast = 4.80%. High‐quality official data; proprietary forecast of moderate transparency.  
• FocusEconomics panel (Mar 2025): Consensus 2025 annual = 5.1%. Reliable methodology; annual horizon.  
• Banco Central ENCFT (Feb 2025): Q4 2024 seasonally unadjusted unemployment = 4.8%; confirms official trend. Excellent primary source.  
• World Bank & IMF (Apr 2025 reports): Project DR 2025 GDP growth ~4.0–4.5%, implying continued job creation; flag tariff headwinds. Credible but indirect labor link.  
• News on US reciprocal tariffs (Apr 2025): Imposes 10% baseline, 90-day pauses; modest near-term drag on exports/tourism. High‐quality journalism and expert commentary.  
• Bain Capital/Oxford Econ spillover studies: U.S. tariff shock to regional growth ~–0.5 pp GDP; moderate drag on employment growth. Peer‐reviewed, credible.

4. Evidence Analysis (Weighing)  
Strong evidence:  
• Official Q4 2024 = 4.80% plus consistent Q1 seasonal uptick (~+0.1–0.3 pp).  
• Historical Q4→Q1 pattern (last five years): average move ~+0.1 pp.  
• Banco Central survey showing employment gains and lowest unemployment in series.

Moderate evidence:  
• World Bank/IMF GDP strong growth supports continued labor demand; tariff headwind adds +0.1 pp unemployment risk.  
• Trading Economics forecast of Q1 2025 = 4.80% from global models.

Weak evidence:  
• Anecdotal press reports on layoffs in U.S. federal agencies (limited spillover).  
• Tourist-sector anecdote (e.g., nightclub collapse) with limited macro labor impact.

5. Timeframe Analysis  
Forecast horizon ≈6 weeks. If horizon halved (~3 weeks), expect little change—data stale, no fresh shocks. If doubled (~12 weeks to Q2), would incorporate broader tourism season and possible tariff policy shifts—wider uncertainty, slightly heavier tails.

6. Justification  
• Baseline: Q4 2024 4.80%.  
• Seasonality: modest rise into Q1 historically +0.1–0.3 pp → baseline ~4.9%.  
• Trend: recent secular decline Q3→Q4 (5.26→4.80) unlikely to repeat fully into Q1; trend effect ~0.0 pp.  
• External shock: U.S. reciprocal tariffs and global slowdown add +0.1–0.2 pp risk.  
Net midpoint ~5.0%, central in (4.5–5.0)% bucket.  

Buckets ranking:  
Most likely = >4.5–5.0%; next = 4.0–4.5% and 5.0–6.0%; extremes (<4.0 or >6.0) highly unlikely.

Probability Calibration  
• ≥0–3.0%: 1% (historically never that low)  
• >3.0–4.0%: 2% (only Q2 2020 hit 3.2%)  
• ≥4.0–4.5%: 17% (could undershoot seasonally)  
• >4.5–5.0%: 56% (central scenario)  
• ≥5.0–6.0%: 23% (upside from tariffs or weaker tourism)  
• >6.0%: 1% (extreme shock only)

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase ✔  
2. Base rates stated ✔  
3. Consistency: most likely >4.5–5.0; least likely <4.0, >6.0 ✔  
4. Key evidence (official Q4, seasonal pattern, tariff headwinds, GDP growth) ✔  
5. Blind spot: sudden domestic policy change (e.g., massive fiscal stimulus hiring) could drive unemployment below 4.5%; probability low → small shift.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, between 0–100 ✔

Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, condensed)

1. Central Bank ENCFT bulletin (12-13 Feb 2025, Spanish press).  Primary micro-survey data for Q4-2024: unemployment 4.8 %, record employment.  High-quality, factual, no opinions.

2. Trading Economics unemployment page & forecast table (update Mar 2025).  Repeats the Central Bank series; adds model forecast 4.8 % for Q1-2025.  History = facts, forecast = informed opinion, medium quality.

3. FocusEconomics consensus (27 Mar 2025).  Panel average, yearly horizon; 2024 = 5.1 %, 2025 ≈ 5.0 %.  Method transparent, good but annual—not quarterly—metric.

4. World Bank Latin-America spring report (23-24 Apr 2025).  Projects DR GDP ≈ 4 % 2025; flags regional headwinds.  Reliable institution; employment implications indirect.

5. NBC / CBS tariff stories (9 Apr 2025).  Hard news on 10 % baseline U.S. tariff and 90-day pause on “reciprocal” layer.  Factual; economic remarks are expert quotes (Moody’s, Wells Fargo).  Relevance: possible medium-term drag.

6. ODI / Atlantic Council / IMF pieces on global trade tension (22 Apr 2025 etc.).  Expert commentary; directionally negative for growth; timing uncertain.  Moderate quality, indirect.

7. Dominican press (Acento, Listín Diario, Apr–Feb 2025).  Local analysts repeat Central Bank numbers, note public perception gap.  Main value: no contradictory evidence to 4.8 % Q4 print.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong
• Central Bank Q4-2024 unemployment = 4.8 % (primary data).  
• Historical quarter-to-quarter volatility ≤ ±0.7 pp 82 % of time since 2006.

Moderate
• Trading Economics forecast 4.8 % for Q1-2025 (model & analyst consensus).  
• World Bank & IMF still expect solid DR growth (~4 %) despite headwinds.  
• 10 % blanket U.S. tariff could trim export-factory hours but effect lags.

Weak
• Public perception articles; nightclub accident; speculative hurricane risk.  
• Allianz/Wells Fargo remarks on U.S. unemployment (indirect channel).

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days to release ≈ 42 (6 weeks).  If the horizon were halved (21 days) I would narrow the inter-bin spread by ~2 pp (less time for surprises).  Doubling to 84 days would widen the tails by ~5 pp, mostly to the ≥5 % bin, to cover a longer window for negative external shocks.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Baseline (outside view):
[1, 4, 15, 35, 40, 5]

Shifters

+ Seasonal tourist peak in Q1 usually shaves ~0.1 pp. (moderate)  
+ Record employment momentum into Dec 2024, wage gains 7 % real. (strong)  
– Mean-reversion: after a 0.5 pp drop Q3→Q4, slight bounce common. (moderate)  
– U.S. tariff noise; however only 10 % layer active and paused after 90 days, so minimal Q1 impact. (weak-to-moderate)  
± Macro forecasts (FocusEconomics 5 % annual) roughly match base. (neutral)

Net: small downward tilt from the ≥5 % bucket into the 4.0-4.9 % buckets.  Tail bins unchanged.

≥0 – 3.0 %  1  
>3.0 – 4.0 %  5  
≥4.0 – 4.5 % 22

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: six bins; Q1-2025 DR unemployment as per TradingEconomics.  
2. Outside view listed above; final still anchored but slightly shifted lower.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = 4.5-5.0 %; least likely = ≤3 %; sensible.  
4. Key evidence: (i) 4.8 % Q4 print; (ii) seasonal Q1 dip; (iii) low volatility history; (iv) tariffs start 5 Apr with 90-day pause; (v) FocusEconomics 5 % consensus.  
5. Blind spot: sudden tourism collapse (hurricane, security scare) before 31 Mar data cutoff, pushing unemployment >6 %.
