Analysis:
The key historical precedent is the 2014 Scottish independence referendum—the only time Scotland officially scheduled a vote on independence. To form an outside‐view baseline, we need to know: who announced the referendum date in 2014 (Scottish Government under First Minister Alex Salmond, following the S30 Order agreed with Westminster), what legal and legislative steps were required (Section 30 Order, Scottish Parliament bill), and the lead time between the announcement and the vote (roughly 9–11 months). Understanding that timeline—along with any subsequent attempts or proposals—will help us gauge how quickly (or slowly) the Scottish Government might move from intent to official scheduling in a new referendum. We also want to review any later statements by First Ministers about setting a date, and whether any sub‐government bodies (like the Electoral Management Board) have been tasked with preparations.

Analysis:
As of May 2, 2025, Nicola Sturgeon has been succeeded by Humza Yousaf as First Minister, and the next Scottish Parliament elections are due in 2026. Under current devolution arrangements, Holyrood lacks the unilateral power to call a legally binding referendum without a Section 30 order from Westminster. The SNP leadership’s public stance, any negotiations over a Section 30 order, and internal party unity are critical factors. Polling shows strengthened support for independence, but UK government resistance remains firm. Key uncertainties include whether Humza Yousaf will prioritize a referendum before the 2026 election, whether he can secure a Section 30 order, and whether the SNP’s governing coalition can maintain cohesion. To build an inside view, we need the latest statements from the First Minister and Scottish cabinet ministers, reports on any ongoing talks with Downing Street, coverage of SNP internal debates on timing, and expert analyses of legal and procedural hurdles.

<Summary source="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/year-in-review-the-2014-scottish-independence-referendum/">
Here is a concise summary of the LSE “Year in review: the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum” (British Politics and Policy at LSE, Dec. 27 2014, Blog Admin). It surveys six LSE blog posts published during 2014 that analyse different political and constitutional facets of the September 18 2014 Scottish referendum and its aftermath:

1. Patrick Dunleavy  
   • Argues the ‘No’ vote removed an existential threat to the UK—for now—but constitutional turbulence will continue to 2020.  
   • Points to a likely narrow 2015 UK general election result and David Cameron’s promised 2017 EU referendum as triggers for further constitutional debate.  
   • Suggests that a 2017 “Leave” vote in the UK could spawn an immediate rerun of the Scottish independence question, this time pitched as a way for Scots to remain EU citizens.

2. Arianna Giovannini & Joanie Willett  
   • Examine the uneven history of English regionalism (North East, Cornwall) under New Labour and beyond.  
   • Contend that Scotland’s referendum has re-energised calls for devolution across England, offering a model to counter London-centrism.

3. Elliott Green  
   • Highlights the SNP’s civic-nationalist ethos—defining Scottish nationhood by voluntary membership and shared civic life, not ethnicity.  
   • Notes this civic frame has attracted strong support from ethnic-minority Scots.

4. Jim Tomlinson  
   • Charts Scotland’s evolution since the 1970s into a post-industrial, partially de-globalised economy.  
   • Maintains that Edinburgh’s fiscal decisions now matter more, meaning Scotland effectively possesses a more distinct “national economy” than ever.

5. Lorenzo Piccoli  
   • Argues the referendum result has “lightened” the value of UK citizenship by exposing tensions between regional autonomy and supranational forces (e.g. migration, the EU).  
   • Describes a shift toward a “citizenship-lite” model as the single sovereign state model weakens.

6. Charlie Jeffery  
   • Interprets William Hague’s proposal for “English Votes for English Laws” as the first step in a broader rethinking of UK territorial governance.  
   • Foresees further moves toward separating England and Wales as distinct jurisdictions and reforming Westminster-Whitehall structures.

<Summary source="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11g7k3v5go">
Here is a concise summary of the BBC’s 22 May 2024 article “July election date disrespectful to Scotland – Swinney”:

• Context & announcement  
  – Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has set the next UK general election for 4 July 2024.  
  – First Minister and new SNP leader John Swinney calls this timing “the latest act of disrespect” to Scotland, since it coincides with the start of Scottish schools’ summer break.

• Parliamentary representation changes  
  – New Westminster constituency boundary changes reduce Scotland’s entitlement from 59 MPs to 57.

• SNP position & past referendum plans  
  – The Scottish government had sought a second independence referendum on 19 October 2023, a date chosen to fall during school holidays.  
  – Swinney argues the UK government “will not have given a moment’s thought” to the impact on Scottish families.

• Polling expert analysis (Sir John Curtice, BBC News)  
  – The SNP is currently polling about 5–6 percentage points behind Labour in Scotland.  
  – With SNP support at 29% in a recent YouGov poll, the party’s Westminster delegation could fall from its current 43 MPs to as few as 11.  
  – By contrast, Labour—at two Scottish MPs now—could win up to 35 seats.  
  – Sir John says it is “an election for Labour to win” and describes Sunak’s timing as “very brave or extremely foolhardy.”

• 2019 baseline & interim changes  
  – In the 2019 UK election, Scotland returned 48 SNP MPs and only one Labour MP (Ian Murray).  
  – Since then, defections and a Labour by-election gain in Rutherglen and Hamilton West have reduced the SNP to 43 MPs.

• Reactions from Scottish party leaders  
  – Scottish Labour’s Anas Sarwar: 14 years of “Tory chaos and failure” makes this a chance for change under Keir Starmer.  
  – Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross: Sees July poll as “a huge opportunity to defeat the SNP” and focus on bread-and-butter issues, urging anti-SNP tactical votes.  
  – Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton: Believes both the Conservatives and SNP have “made a mess” and that Lib Dems can pick up seats in the Highlands (e.g., Lochaber, Skye & Wester Ross).

# The 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum: Timeline and Process  

The 2014 Scottish independence referendum marked a pivotal moment in the United Kingdom’s constitutional history, culminating in a decisive vote on Scotland’s political future. This report reconstructs the timeline and procedural milestones that defined the referendum, drawing on legislative records, intergovernmental agreements, and electoral administration documents.  

---

## Historical Context and Political Foundations  

### Origins of the Referendum Mandate  
The Scottish National Party (SNP), under First Minister Alex Salmond, secured a majority in the 2011 Scottish Parliament elections, fulfilling its manifesto pledge to hold an independence referendum[8][11]. This electoral mandate set the stage for negotiations with the UK government, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, to transfer legal authority for the referendum to the Scottish Parliament[13][15].  

### The Edinburgh Agreement (2012)  
On 15 October 2012, the UK and Scottish governments signed the **Edinburgh Agreement**, a landmark accord enabling a legally binding referendum under Section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998[13][14][15]. Key provisions included:  
- A single-question referendum to be held by the end of 2014.  
- The Scottish Parliament’s authority to legislate on the referendum’s date, franchise, and conduct.  
- Oversight by the Electoral Commission to ensure impartiality[13][15].  

This agreement resolved jurisdictional disputes, as the UK government initially contested Holyrood’s competence to legislate on constitutional matters[8][14].  

---

## Legislative Framework and Key Dates  

### Section 30 Order and Devolution of Powers  
The **Scotland Act 1998 (Modification of Schedule 5) Order 2013**, approved by both parliaments and enacted on 12 February 2013, temporarily devolved powers to Holyrood to authorize the referendum[8][13][14]. This Order-in-Council neutralized legal challenges and established a clear constitutional pathway for the vote[11][13].  

### The Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013  
The Scottish Parliament passed the **Scottish Independence Referendum Act** on 14 November 2013, receiving Royal Assent on 17 December 2013[2][8][9]. The Act enshrined:  
- The referendum date: **18 September 2014**[1][2][4].  
- The question: *“Should Scotland be an independent country?”* vetted by the Electoral Commission for clarity[1][9][12].  
- A franchise extending to 16- and 17-year-olds, a first for UK-wide elections[4][8][10].  

---

## Administrative Timeline and Key Milestones  

### Voter Registration and Eligibility  
The electoral roll closed on **2 September 2014**, with over 4.3 million registered voters, including 109,000 16- and 17-year-olds[1][4][10]. Postal vote applications surged by 20% compared to 2014 local elections, reaching 680,235 by mid-August[1][4].  

### Regulated Campaign Period  
The **referendum period** commenced on **30 May 2014**, imposing spending limits on designated campaign groups:  
- £1.5 million for designated lead campaigns (Yes Scotland and Better Together).  
- £150,000 for registered participants[2][9][10].  
Campaign materials and public statements were restricted from 22 August 2014 to prevent undue influence[2][10].  

---

## The Referendum Vote and Results  

### Polling Day and Turnout  
On **18 September 2014**, 84.6% of the electorate voted—the highest turnout for a UK ballot since 1950[12]. Regional disparities emerged, with East Dunbartonshire recording 91% turnout and Glasgow 75%[12].  

### Outcome  
The final result, announced on **19 September 2014**, rejected independence:  
- **No**: 2,001,926 votes (55.3%).  
- **Yes**: 1,617,989 votes (44.7%)[1][3][12].  
The margin of 10.6% underscored enduring support for the Union, though post-referendum polling identified shifting demographics, with younger voters disproportionately favoring independence[7][12].  

---

## Post-Referendum Developments  

### The Smith Commission and Further Devolution  
Prime Minister Cameron established the **Smith Commission** on **19 September 2014** to negotiate additional devolved powers for Scotland[2][11]. The resulting **Scotland Act 2016** transferred control over income tax rates, welfare programs, and electoral systems to Holyrood[2][11].  

### Legal and Political Legacy  
The referendum’s procedural rigor—particularly the Section 30 mechanism—established a template for future constitutional votes[11][13]. However, the SNP’s continued electoral success reignited calls for a second referendum, culminating in the **Scottish Independence Referendum Bill 2023**, proposed for 19 October 2023[5][6][11].  

---

## Conclusion  

The 2014 referendum exemplified cooperative devolution, with cross-governmental agreements ensuring legal clarity and public confidence. Its legacy persists in ongoing debates over Scottish self-determination, underscored by meticulous legislative planning and high civic engagement. While the result preserved the Union, the process redefined Scotland’s political trajectory, setting precedents for democratic deliberation in multinational states.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the provided EUROPP article by Anthony Salamone (July 26, 2022).

Key Facts and Developments
1. Referendum Bill and Date
   • In June 2022, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced draft Scottish legislation to hold a second independence referendum on 19 October 2023.  
   • The SNP lacks an outright majority in Holyrood but, together with the pro-independence Scottish Greens (via a cooperation agreement), holds sufficient votes to pass the bill.

2. Building a New Scotland Campaign
   • The Scottish government launched “Building a New Scotland,” a series of position papers updating its case for independence. Two papers have been published to date; further papers are forthcoming.  
   • This contrasts with the 2014 approach of a single 650-page white paper.

3. UK Government Response and Legal Challenge
   • Sturgeon wrote to outgoing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson seeking agreement on a new referendum; Johnson replied, reiterating his opposition.  
   • The UK government has not requested a Section 30 order (the mechanism used in 2014 to confer competence), leaving it unclear if Holyrood can lawfully legislate for a referendum unilaterally.  
   • Scotland’s Lord Advocate, Dorothy Bain, pre-emptively referred the bill’s competence to the UK Supreme Court. The Court is currently deciding whether to hear the case and, if so, how to rule.

4. Contingency “Plan B”
   • If the Supreme Court rules the Scottish Parliament lacks competence and Westminster refuses a Section 30 order, the SNP will treat the next UK general election as a “de facto referendum.”  
   • Under this plan, if the SNP wins either a majority of Scottish seats or of the votes cast in Scotland (standard to be determined), Holyrood would interpret that result as an independent mandate and seek negotiations on independence.

Opinions and Analysis from the Article
1. Major Gamble
   • Anthony Salamone (EUROPP): Sturgeon’s strategy is “a major gamble,” given the UK government’s steadfast opposition.

2. Boldly Majoritarian Approach
   • The strategy prioritises satisfying existing independence supporters rather than rebuilding cross-party consensus.  
   • Unlike the 2014 referendum—which had backing from all major Scottish parties regardless of their independence stance—today only pro-independence parties support the vote.

3. Prejudging the Court Case
   • Sturgeon’s statement that a negative Supreme Court judgment would be “the fault of Westminster legislation” suggests the Scottish government has already framed the legal outcome as foregone.

4. Lack of Bilateral Engagement
   • The article critiques the Scottish government for making “only perfunctory” efforts to negotiate referendum terms with Westminster and instead intensifying rhetoric against the UK government.

Potentially Useful but Less-Established Views
   • Treating a UK general election as an independence plebiscite was once a fringe notion within the SNP; its elevation to official policy marks a significant departure.  
   • Discarding efforts to build cross-party support may undermine the referendum’s credibility and broad acceptance of its result.

Here are the key points from the BBC’s 28 June 2022 article “Scottish independence: 19 October 2023 proposed as date for referendum”:

Facts & developments  
• First Minister Nicola Sturgeon formally proposes holding indyref2 on 19 October 2023, using the same question as 2014 (“Should Scotland be an independent country?”).  
• She has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson seeking a Section 30 order to transfer legal power for a referendum from Westminster to Holyrood (as was done in 2014).  
• The Scottish government’s Lord Advocate has referred its proposed Referendum Bill to the UK Supreme Court to test whether Holyrood can lawfully hold a vote without UK government approval. Court papers have been served and the Supreme Court president will decide on next steps.  
• If the court rules Holyrood lacks power, the SNP would instead treat the next UK general election as a “de facto referendum,” campaigning solely on independence. If the court rules in Scotland’s favour, the government will proceed immediately to pass its Referendum Bill.  

Polling data  
• Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice notes that the last half-dozen polls average 48 percent support for independence versus 52 percent against (excluding “don’t know” responses).  

Official UK government position (reliable named sources)  
• Prime Minister Boris Johnson: “We’ll study [the proposal] very carefully and respond properly,” but “now is not the time” for another referendum; the constitution is a matter for Westminster.  
• UK government spokesperson: priorities remain cost-of-living, energy security, response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and economic growth; law officers are considering the Supreme Court referral.  

Reactions from Scottish opposition leaders (named sources)  
• Douglas Ross (Scottish Conservatives): another referendum is the “wrong priority” and would “hinder Scotland’s recovery from the pandemic.”  
• Anas Sarwar (Scottish Labour): Sturgeon has abandoned pandemic recovery focus in favour of a vote “that two-thirds of Scots don’t want right now.”  
• Alex Cole-Hamilton (Scottish Liberal Democrats): the proposal is an “appalling waste of energy,” with Sturgeon’s “fixation” on independence overshadowing other needs.

Key facts and events
• Humza Yousaf resigned as Scotland’s first minister on April 29, 2024, after his minority coalition government collapsed.  
• Nicola Sturgeon resigned as first minister in February 2023 and was arrested in connection with an SNP finances probe; her husband, Peter Murrell, was charged in April 2024 with embezzlement.  
• Alex Salmond (first minister before Sturgeon) founded the pro-independence Alba Party after his 2020 acquittal on sexual assault charges; Alba performed poorly in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.  
• The UK Supreme Court ruled in late 2022 that the Scottish government lacks legal authority to hold an independence referendum without Westminster’s consent.  
• In summer 2021, UK government ministers said a second referendum could proceed only if “consistent” polling support emerged; this threshold has not been met.  
• SNP polling under Yousaf plunged as Scottish Labour, led by Anas Sarwar, regained ground; Labour aims to win the 2026 Holyrood election.

Public opinion and polling  
• 2014 referendum result: 45 percent Yes, 55 percent No.  
• Post-Covid polls showed support for independence near historic highs—approaching 50 percent—but momentum stalled thereafter.  
  – Mark Diffley (pollster): Sturgeon’s pandemic approval “through the roof” helped push independence support to all-time highs in 2021.  
  – Stephen Noon (chief strategist, 2014 Yes campaign): “The energy from the 2014 wave has petered out,” though it left support at a “new high-water mark.”  
• SNP MP (anonymous): “We need to be realistic…we aren’t there yet” on building sustained pro-independence support.

Opinions from named sources
• Andrew Neil (unionist journalist, Daily Mail): Declared independence “dead for a generation” after Yousaf’s departure.  
• Bella Caledonia (pro-independence blog): Called Yousaf’s claim that indyref 2 is “frustratingly close” “delusional.” (less formal outlet)  
• Stewart McDonald (SNP MP, Scotsman): Successor must acknowledge indyref 2 is not “frustratingly close” and that “significant political and intellectual hurdles remain.”  

Political outlook  
• SNP is leaderless and divided; potential civil war awaiting the leadership contest between Kate Forbes and other contenders.  
• No formal date for a second referendum has been announced, and with the party in disarray and no “consistent” polling surge, a referendum is not currently scheduled.
</Summary>

<Summary source="https://politicstoday.org/humza-yousaf-scotland-first-minister-islam/">
Here is a concise summary of the Politics Today article “Biggest Honor of My Life”, Says Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s First Minister (March 31, 2023). 

Facts and Milestones  
• On March 28, 2023, the Scottish Parliament approved Humza Yousaf as SNP leader; on March 29 he was sworn in as First Minister.  
• Yousaf won the leadership contest with 52.1% of SNP members’ votes versus Kate Forbes’s 47.9%.  
• He is Scotland’s—and indeed Western Europe’s—first head of government from an ethnic‐minority background and the first Muslim in that role.  

Yousaf’s Stated Priorities  
• Protect Scots from cost-of-living pressures  
• Recover and reform the NHS and other public services  
• Support a “well-being economy”  
• Improve life chances across Scotland  

Party Dynamics and Popularity  
• Forbes, seen as a “change” candidate, remains more popular with the public than Yousaf, according to an Ipsos Scotland poll (Mar 17–21).  
• Nicola Sturgeon leads all Scottish and Westminster figures in favorability (46%), outpolling UK PM Rishi Sunak (20%).  
• Yousaf campaigned as Sturgeon’s continuity candidate but faces the task of uniting a party divided by a close leadership race.  

Legislative Actions & Constitutional Issues  
• Yousaf was one of 86 MSPs who voted in December 2022 to pass the Gender Recognition Reform bill (86–39), lowering the age for a Gender Recognition Certificate from 18 to 16 and cutting application time from two years to months.  
• The UK government used its Section 35 power to block that bill, citing conflicts with the UK Equalities Act and concerns over women’s-only spaces. Yousaf called this an “unprecedented attack” on devolution.  
• Two months earlier, Scotland had lost its Supreme Court bid to hold a secession referendum without Westminster consent.  

Comments on Independence and UK Relations  
• In interviews, Yousaf reiterated his long-term aim of EU membership for an independent Scotland and said he would “continue to govern well…and demonstrate…the benefits of decisions about their lives being taken here in Scotland.”  
• UK PM Rishi Sunak warned him against using a future UK general election to “hijack” support for a second independence referendum, arguing Scots want both governments to “deliver for them” on bread-and-butter issues.

Article details  
Source: The Guardian  
Date: June 24, 2023  
Author: Libby Brooks  

Key points  
1. Mandate via general election  
   - SNP leader Humza Yousaf told party members in Dundee that an SNP victory in the next UK general election would itself be a democratic mandate to press Westminster for Scottish independence.  
   - This approach replaces Nicola Sturgeon’s “de facto referendum” plan (whereby a majority of votes for pro-independence parties would be treated as a mandate).  

2. Manifesto commitment  
   - Yousaf proposes the SNP’s next manifesto open with “Vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country.”  
   - He insists plan A remains holding a legally sanctioned referendum, but if Westminster blocks Holyrood’s request for powers, an election win would compel UK parties to justify denying a vote in a “voluntary union.”  

3. Post-election strategy  
   - An SNP win would trigger:  
     • Negotiations on transferring powers from Westminster to Holyrood  
     • A nationwide consultation on a draft interim constitution  
     • Appointment of an EU envoy in Brussels to prepare for re-entry  

4. Polling context  
   - Average support for independence stands at 48% (What Scotland Thinks), largely unchanged since the last Holyrood election.  
   - SNP’s internal troubles have dented party support but not the broader independence question; Scottish Labour has benefited.  

5. Next steps  
   - The SNP will finalize its independence strategy at its autumn conference in October.  

Additional context  
• This was the SNP’s first major gathering since the arrests of senior party figures amid a finances probe.  
• A tribute was paid to veteran pro-independence politician Winnie Ewing (d. June 2023).

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Parliament.uk Timeline**: This is a high-quality official government source providing factual chronology of events from 1707 to 2016 related to the Scottish independence movement. It objectively documents key milestones without offering opinions, making it very reliable for establishing the historical sequence and timeframe of the 2014 referendum process.

**Participedia Case Study**: A reliable academic source presenting both facts (referendum costs, participation rates, results) and clearly identified opinions from named entities (Scottish Government/SNP positions). The factual content about the referendum process is particularly valuable for understanding administrative requirements.

**LSE Blog Review**: A meta-analysis of academic perspectives on the 2014 referendum. Contains expert opinions from named academics (particularly Patrick Dunleavy's prediction of constitutional turbulence through 2020), but clearly distinguishes between factual reporting and analysis. Useful for understanding academic interpretations of referendum implications.

**BBC Article (May 2024)**: Recent reporting on the July 2024 UK general election announcement. Contains both factual reporting and expert opinion from respected pollster Sir John Curtice regarding SNP's declining electoral prospects. The timing of this article (less than a year before our forecast deadline) makes it particularly relevant.

**Britannica Articles**: High-quality encyclopedic sources containing primarily factual information about the 2014 referendum, Brexit, and related political developments. Notes that the Scottish Assembly backed Nicola Sturgeon's call for another independence referendum before spring 2019 (which didn't materialize).

**Perplexity Report**: A comprehensive synthesis covering the legal and procedural framework of the 2014 referendum. Particularly valuable for understanding the Section 30 order process, timelines, and failed attempts at subsequent referendums. Primarily factual with minimal opinion content.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

For this forecasting question, I've identified several potential reference classes:

1. **The 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum Process**: The most directly relevant reference class. Shows that the formal process required:
   - Intergovernmental agreement (Edinburgh Agreement - October 2012)
   - Legal mechanism (Section 30 Order - January 2013)
   - Official date announcement (March 2013)
   - Referendum execution (September 2014)
   
   This timeline shows approximately 5 months between legal agreement and date announcement.

2. **Failed Post-2014 Referendum Attempts**: Several unsuccessful attempts to launch a second referendum, including Sturgeon's proposed October 2023 date. These attempts lacked UK government cooperation and ultimately failed.

3. **UK-Wide Referendums**: Less directly applicable, but the Brexit referendum showed a shorter timeframe (announced February 2016 for June 2016).

The most suitable reference class combines the first two, as they provide direct insights into both the successful and unsuccessful pathways to Scottish independence referendums.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

With today's date being May 2, 2025, we have approximately 60 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline. Examining historical patterns:

- The 2014 referendum process took years to complete, with about 22 months between the Edinburgh Agreement and the actual referendum
- The announcement of the referendum date (March 21, 2013) occurred 18 months before the vote
- Previous attempts to schedule a second referendum have failed despite years of advocacy
- The July 2024 UK general election would have occurred 10-11 months before our deadline

The compressed 60-day window is significantly shorter than historical precedent for such announcements, suggesting time constraints would be a major factor.

## (d) Justification

The question hinges on whether an official with authority in Scotland will announce a referendum date before July 1, 2025. Several key factors inform my outside view:

1. **Legal and Procedural Precedent**: The 2014 referendum required extensive legal groundwork (Edinburgh Agreement, Section 30 order) before an announcement was made. Historical precedent suggests this process typically takes many months.

2. **Question Fine Print Consideration**: Importantly, the question specifies that UK government approval is not necessary for resolution - only that someone with authority in Scotland makes the announcement. This significantly lowers the bar compared to the 2014 process.

3. **Political Context**: The BBC article from May 2024 indicated the SNP was trailing Labour by 5-6 percentage points ahead of the July 2024 election, with projections suggesting their Westminster representation could fall from 43 to as few as 11 MPs. This would represent a significant weakening of their political mandate.

4. **Failed Previous Attempts**: Despite SNP control of the Scottish government since 2014, multiple attempts to schedule a second referendum have failed, demonstrating the difficulties in moving from political intent to official announcement.

5. **Timeframe Constraints**: The short 60-day window remaining before the deadline contrasts sharply with the historical timeline of referendum processes, which typically span many months or years.

## Outside view calibration:

In calibrating my prediction, I must balance several competing factors:

1. The historical evidence shows that the process of getting to a referendum announcement is typically lengthy and complex, requiring months of preparation.

2. The SNP appeared to be in a weakened political position as of May 2024, potentially diminishing their ability to push forward controversial constitutional initiatives.

3. The question's fine print creates a significantly lower threshold than existed for the 2014 referendum, as it only requires an announcement by Scottish authorities, regardless of UK government approval.

4. There is precedent for unilateral announcements (like Sturgeon's proposed 2023 date), even if these ultimately faced legal challenges.

Given these factors, I assess a relatively low probability. The shortened timeframe (60 days) and apparent political headwinds facing the SNP significantly constrain the likelihood. However, the lowered bar for what constitutes an "official announcement" means I cannot dismiss the possibility entirely.

## Outside View Prediction:
18%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Parliament.uk Timeline**
   - Comprehensive chronology (1707-2016) from an official UK government source
   - Highly reliable for factual data on past referendum processes
   - Contains no opinions, only documented historical events
   - Valuable for understanding the procedural timeline of the 2014 referendum

2. **Participedia.net Case Study**
   - Detailed factual breakdown of the 2014 referendum logistics, voter participation, and campaign financing
   - Academic/research source with minimal opinion content
   - Useful for understanding administrative requirements for referendums

3. **LSE Blog Review**
   - Academic analysis summarizing six scholarly perspectives on the 2014 referendum
   - Contains expert opinions from identified academics (Patrick Dunleavy, Arianna Giovannini, etc.)
   - Key expert opinion: Dunleavy predicted constitutional turbulence through 2020 and noted EU referendum could trigger another Scottish independence vote

4. **BBC News (May 2024)**
   - Recent reporting on UK general election timing (July 4, 2024)
   - Factual content on SNP polling position (5-6 points behind Labour)
   - Contains attributed opinions from political figures and polling expert Sir John Curtice
   - Notes previous Scottish government plan for independence referendum on October 19, 2023

5. **Britannica Articles (Cameron/Brexit)**
   - Factual encyclopedia entries on the 2014 referendum and Brexit aftermath
   - Documents Scottish Assembly backing Sturgeon's call for a new referendum before spring 2019
   - Limited opinion content, primarily historical documentation

6. **Perplexity Report**
   - Comprehensive analysis of the legal and procedural framework for the 2014 referendum
   - Highlights importance of Section 30 Order and Edinburgh Agreement
   - Documents that post-2014 referendum attempts included proposed 2023 referendum

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Three potential reference classes are relevant:

1. **Previous Scottish independence referendum process (2012-2014)**
   - Established legal template requiring UK-Scotland agreement, Section 30 Order, and Scottish legislation
   - Strengths: Provides procedural blueprint and timeline requirements
   - Limitation: Political context has changed significantly since Brexit

2. **Failed attempts to secure a second referendum (2016-present)**
   - Multiple unsuccessful attempts since Brexit vote (including Sturgeon's calls for 2019 and 2023 referendums)
   - Strengths: Reflects current political obstacles and UK government resistance
   - Limitation: Political landscape could change after July 2024 UK election

3. **Major political initiatives in pre-election periods**
   - Governments typically avoid major constitutional announcements close to elections
   - Limitation: Less directly relevant to specific Scottish political dynamics

The most suitable reference class is a combination of the first two, as they provide both the procedural requirements and current political context specific to Scottish independence referendums.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is approximately 2 months (May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025).

Key timeline considerations:
- The 2014 referendum had an 18-month lead time from announcement (March 2013) to vote (September 2014)
- UK general election scheduled for July 4, 2024, approximately 11 months before our prediction deadline
- Previous attempts at securing a referendum since 2016 have failed to reach official announcement stage
- Any referendum would likely require complex legal preparations (Section 30 Order, legislation) which typically take months

## (d) Justification

Several factors suggest a low probability of an official referendum date announcement by July 1, 2025:

1. **Legal and procedural hurdles**: The 2014 precedent required:
   - UK-Scotland agreement (Edinburgh Agreement)
   - Section 30 Order
   - Scottish Parliament legislation
   These steps typically require significant negotiation time.

2. **Historical pattern of unsuccessful attempts**: Multiple attempts to secure a second referendum since 2016 have failed to progress to announcement stage.

3. **Political resistance**: UK governments have consistently resisted granting Section 30 Orders since 2016.

4. **Electoral uncertainty**: BBC reporting indicates the SNP is currently polling behind Labour. A potential poor showing in the July 2024 UK election could weaken the political mandate for another referendum.

5. **Short timeframe**: With only 2 months remaining until the resolution date, there is limited time for the typical negotiation and legal processes.

However, some factors could increase the probability:

1. **Potential political shifts**: The July 2024 UK election could change the political calculus if pro-independence parties perform well.

2. **Precedent for unilateral action**: The question specifies that UK legality is irrelevant; the Scottish government could theoretically announce a referendum date without UK approval, though this would be legally contested.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I consider:

1. **Historical success rate**: Since 2016, there have been at least two documented attempts to secure a second referendum (before 2019 and in 2023). None have reached the official announcement stage, suggesting a very low baseline probability.

2. **Electoral timing**: The July 2024 UK election occurs 11 months before our deadline. Even if this election produces a favorable outcome for independence advocates, the typical timeline for securing agreements and passing legislation (as seen in the 2012-2014 process) would extend beyond July 2025.

3. **Legal requirements**: While the question specifies that UK legality is irrelevant for resolution, political reality suggests the Scottish government would prefer a legally recognized process, which requires UK cooperation that has not been forthcoming.

4. **Current polling trajectory**: Current polling shows declining rather than increasing support for the SNP, which would typically make a referendum announcement less likely.

Given these factors and considering that no second referendum date has been announced despite multiple attempts over nearly a decade, the probability must be low. However, I cannot completely rule out the possibility of a unilateral announcement or significant political shift after the July 2024 election.

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. UK Parliament timeline (Parliament.uk): A high-quality, factual chronology of the 2012–2014 referendum process, including key dates (Edinburgh Agreement, Section 30 order, bill passage, announcement of 18 Sep 2014). Contains almost no opinion.  
2. Participedia case summary: Reliable facts on the 2014 referendum’s mechanics (costs, franchise, turnout, campaign caps) and a small number of expert quotations drawn from official papers. Opinion sections are explicitly attributed to named bodies (SNP, Electoral Commission).  
3. LSE blog review: A collection of six academic commentaries offering expert interpretations of the referendum’s broader significance. Contains opinion but clearly credited to individual scholars; useful for political context, not for scheduling mechanics.  
4. BBC News (22 May 2024): Quality journalism reporting on current SNP positions and Westminster boundary changes. Mixes factual reporting (election date, party polling) with expert commentary (Sir John Curtice). Relevant for gauging political will but not procedural detail.  
5. Britannica (David Cameron article, April 2025; Brexit referendum article, May 2025): Solid encyclopedic summaries of post-2014 events (2015 election, Smith Commission, Brexit vote) and mentions the Scottish Parliament’s 2017 backing of a new referendum. Lacks real time detail on 2023/2024 debates but confirms the pattern of multi-year lead times.

Extracted facts vs. opinions  
– Facts: 2014 referendum required ~18 months’ lead time from agreement to vote; an Edinburgh Agreement and Section 30 order were essential; Holyrood announced date on 21 Mar 2013 for a 18 Sep 2014 vote.  
– Opinions: Analyses of political “momentum” or “respect” (e.g., Swinney’s “act of disrespect”) are clearly attributed and should be weighted but not confused with procedural facts.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
1. Devolved/intra-state referendums in mature democracies (e.g. Quebec 1980/1995, Catalonia 2017). Quebec announced dates ~4–6 months before the vote; Catalonia declared independence without a legal vote. However, both had distinct constitutional contexts.  
2. Sub-national plebiscites in the UK (2014 Scotland): one in-class data point, but one sample.  
3. Fast-tracked referendums globally under political pressure: tend to occur under emergencies or with cross-party backing.  

Suitability: The 2014 Scotland process (class 1 combined UK context) is most comparable, but its 18-month lead time is unusually long. Quebec’s 6-month lead time suggests the absolute minimum. Two months is below all known precedents for a legislature-backed referendum in a stable system.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today is 2 May 2025; question closes 1 July 2025—a 60-day window.  
Historical patterns:  
– 2013–2014 Scotland: 18 months between agreement (Oct 2012) and vote (Sep 2014). 6 months between Section 30 order (Feb 2013) and vote.  
– Quebec 1995: referendum called Feb 1995 for a 30 Oct 1995 vote—~8 months lead time.  
– No known case of a legally grounded referendum called with under 3 months’ lead time.  

(d) Justification for outside view probability  
– Procedural inertia: No recent Section 30 negotiations or bill introductions reported in reliable sources for 2024/early 2025.  
– Political incentives: SNP/Green majority could pass a resolution at Holyrood, but UK government remains opposed; scheduling without UK agreement would be constitutionally contested, making an “official announcement” less likely in practice.  
– Electoral calendar: May and June 2025 are dominated by UK general election aftermath, EU tensions, and budget debates; little parliamentary bandwidth for carving out a referendum.  
– Reference-class inference: Even under accelerated conditions (Quebec), 6–8 months is the floor. We have only 2 months.  

Outside view calibration:  
My raw base rate for a devolved referendum being officially scheduled within two months of unknown prior groundwork is near zero—say 2–3%. Given the sustained but stalled SNP push for a referendum, and the preservation of a pro-referendum majority, I’ll round up to reflect residual tail risk. I calibrate my outside-view probability at 5%.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 5% chance that, before July 1 2025, the Scottish government will officially announce a date for an independence referendum.

      – Factual summary of the 2012–2014 referendum process: negotiation of the Edinburgh Agreement, Section 30 Order, bill dates, announcement of the 18 Sep 2014 date on 21 Mar 2013.  
      – High quality: official government publication, authoritative for procedural milestones. Opinions: none.  
   b. Participedia article  
      – Factual data on costs, turnout, spending caps, franchise expansion, and process details of 2014.  
      – Good quality: aggregation of official figures; occasional unattributed observations but no expert opinions beyond citing the SNP white paper.  
   c. LSE “Year in Review” blog  
      – Six thematic essays reflecting academic interpretations of the 2014 vote and its aftermath.  
      – Quality: reputable academic source, but contains opinion/analysis by individual scholars (e.g., Dunleavy on constitutional turbulence). Use primarily for context on political dynamics rather than hard dates.  
   d. BBC News (22 May 2024)  
      – Reports on Swinney’s criticism of a July 2024 UK general election date, updates on SNP polling and leadership, recounts SNP’s plan for an October 2023 referendum date.  
      – High quality: mainstream media, quotes named experts (Sir John Curtice). Separate fact (sequence of events, poll numbers) from opinion (Swinney’s “disrespectful”).  
   e. Britannica “David Cameron – Scottish referendum…” (April 2025)  
      – Retrospective on 2014 referendum, 2015 UK election, Brexit, and note that the Scottish Assembly backed Sturgeon’s call for a second referendum by spring 2019.  
      – High quality encyclopedic summary; minimal opinion.  
   f. Britannica “United Kingdom – The ‘Brexit’ referendum” (May 2025)  
      – Broad recap of Brexit referendum chronology, mentions Scottish Assembly backing Sturgeon’s call for a 2019 vote.  
      – Quality: reliable for Brexit timeline; only indirect relevance to Scottish referendum push.  
   g. Perplexity report  
      – Synthesizes multiple sources into structured timeline of 2014 process, lists 15 external references.  
      – Quality: useful cross-check of dates but likely an AI-generated mashup; verify against original sources.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
   Potential reference classes:  
   • “Scheduling of major national referendums by subnational governments” – N=1 (2014 Scotland) with ~18 months’ lead; the single data point limits reliability.  
   • “Attempts by devolved administrations to schedule referendums without central government consent” – includes Scotland’s 2022 bill for an Oct 2023 vote (led to no enactment). N~1–2. Suggests that unilateral scheduling without UK approval is attempted but not completed.  
   • “Announcements of major votes by governments within 3 months of polling date” – historically zero cases for UK referendums; governments schedule votes at least 6–12 months ahead.  
   Conclusion: The most suitable reference class is the first category, but supplemented by the third: official scheduling requires substantial lead time (≥6 months), and unilateral bills have failed or stalled.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Today: 2 May 2025. Deadline: 1 July 2025. Time remaining ≈60 days.  
   – Historical pattern: 2013 announcement → 18 months’ lead. 2022 bill → ~19 months lead → subsequently deemed illegal. No case of scheduling <3 months ahead.  

4. Status quo and political context  
   – UK general election held 4 July 2024; strong anti-SNP swing reduced SNP Westminster seats.  
   – New SNP leader John Swinney (Feb 2025) faces low polling (~29% in Scotland) and no Section 30 Order.  
   – UK government remains opposed to a third referendum; legal route blocked. No credible path to secure necessary powers within 2 months.  
   – SNP internal resources likely focused on recovery from 2024 defeat and Holyrood election preparations, not imminent referendum.  

5. Justification  
   – Procedural: Official scheduling has historically required at least 6–12 months’ lead time and legal underpinning (Section 30 Order). None of those prerequisites is in place now.  
   – Political: Lack of UK consent, weak SNP polling, leadership transition, and immediate focus on other elections reduce the chance of a surprise late announcement.  
   – Comparative: No case of devolved government announcing a binding vote with <3 months’ notice. Attempts to unilaterally schedule in 2022 stalled.  
   – Expert expectation: Sir John Curtice and others project SNP rebuilding in 2026–27, not pushing a rushed referendum in mid-2025.  

Outside view calibration:  
   – Baseline outside-view from reference class: near zero probability for subnational governments to schedule a major referendum within <3 months of polling.  
   – Adjust for legal/political tail risk (e.g., an emergency push): modest uptick but still very low.  
   – Final calibration: 2% probability.

Outside View Prediction:  
2% (±1%)

I assign a 2% chance that, before July 1, 2025, the Scottish government will officially announce a date for an independence referendum.

Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Source analysis  
• Parliament.uk timeline (2014 referendum) – Purely factual legislative chronology; high-quality primary source. No opinions.  
• Participedia case study – Mostly factual (dates, spending, turnout) with some summarised pro-/anti-independence arguments. Opinions are clearly attributed to SNP and Electoral Commission. Reliability: good for process facts.  
• LSE blog “Year in Review 2014” – Academic commentary; contains forward-looking opinions from named scholars (e.g., Patrick Dunleavy) but no hard data for 2025. Useful only as contextual colour.  
• BBC 22 May 2024 article – High-quality journalism. Factual polling numbers & quotations from Sir John Curtice (recognised elections expert). Contains partisan statements from party leaders (treated as advocacy, not evidence).  
• Britannica (Cameron, Brexit) – Encyclopaedic, fact-checked history; high reliability for chronology but little 2024-25 content on Scotland.  
• Britannica (Brexit referendum) – Same quality; shows 2017 Holyrood vote for a new Section 30 request, illustrating repeated (but unsuccessful) attempts.  
• Perplexity report (timeline deep-dive) – Aggregates multiple public sources; useful for seeing legislative steps and the 2013 “date-announced” point. Considered secondary; cross-checked key facts with Parliament.uk.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes considered:  
1. Times Scotland has officially scheduled an independence referendum since devolution (1999-2025). Result: 1 success (2013) in 26 years ⇒ base annual rate ≈ 3.8 %.  
2. All official independence-referendum announcements by any OECD sub-state unit (e.g., Catalonia 2014 & 2017, Quebec 1980 & 1995). Rough count: ~6 announcements in ~40 sub-state units over 40 years ≈ 0.4 % per unit-year. Less tailored to Scotland.  
3. All cases where the SNP held government and publicly sought a referendum (2011-today). SNP majority/minority governments held power for 14 years; only one qualifying announcement ⇒ ≈ 7 % per SNP-government-year, but power alone is insufficient (need UK consent or workaround).  

Class #1 is the most directly relevant: “How often has a lawful Scottish authority actually named a date?”

C. Time-frame analysis  
We are 60 days from 1 July 2025. Historical pattern: in 2013 the date (18 Sept 2014) was announced 18 months in advance. No precedent exists for giving as little as two months’ notice. In Westminster-style systems, referendums on major constitutional issues typically allow 6–24 months of lead-time for legislation, campaign regulation and Electoral Commission preparation (e.g., Brexit 2016: date announced four months ahead, but the bill had been introduced earlier). Therefore, empirically the “base-rate” conditional on only 60 days remaining is far lower than the average annual rate above.

Putting the annual 3.8 % rate into a 60-day window:  
3.8 % ×(60 / 365) ≈ 0.6 %.

D. Justification of outside-view probability  
• Only one successful scheduling ever (2013), and that gave 18 months’ notice.  
• No instances world-wide of an independence referendum being scheduled <3 months before polling day; administrative constraints make a Scottish precedent in the next 60 days extremely unlikely.  
• The UK Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling removed Scottish-only competence, so the universe of “lawful Scottish authorities” capable of scheduling has effectively shrunk to one pathway: obtain a Section 30 order or UK legislation—neither can plausibly be achieved and announced inside 60 days given Westminster recess calendar (late May dissolution already for the 2025 general election) and Holyrood procedural requirements.  
• Polling (Sir John Curtice) shows the SNP has weakened, making London concessions less likely (but this belongs more to an inside-view; the outside view merely notes zero historical examples of rapid scheduling under hostile UK governments).

Numerical outside-view synthesis  
Raw 60-day base-rate ≈ 0.6 %. To reflect extreme administrative lead-time mismatch we down-weight by 50 % (no precedent for <3 months lead) ⇒ 0.3 %. To avoid spurious precision, round to the nearest 0.1 %.

Outside view calibration:
A purely historical/structural reading—independent of day-to-day politics—suggests a probability on the order of one-third of one percent that a lawful Scottish authority will, within the next two months, announce a date for an independence referendum.

Outside View Prediction:
0.3 % (≈ 1-in-330 odds) chance that, before 1 July 2025, the government of Scotland officially announces a date for an independence referendum.

Final predictions: [15.0, 2.0, 15.0, 2.0, 1]
Result: 6.0

## Source Analysis

1. **Parliament.uk Timeline** (unknown date): High-quality official government source presenting factual chronology of Scottish independence developments from 1707-2016. Contains purely factual information without opinions.

2. **LSE EUROPP Blog** (July 26, 2022): Academic article from London School of Economics analyzing Sturgeon's June 2022 referendum strategy. Provides factual reporting on the draft legislation for October 2023 referendum and Supreme Court referral. Contains identified opinion from author Anthony Salamone calling the strategy "a major gamble."

3. **BBC News** (June 28, 2022): High-quality reporting on Sturgeon's formal proposal for October 2023 referendum. Includes factual details about proposed referendum, Supreme Court referral, and polling (from expert Prof. Sir John Curtice). Contains identified opinions from named political figures (Boris Johnson, opposition leaders).

4. **POLITICO Article** (likely April/May 2024): Reputable political reporting covering Humza Yousaf's resignation on April 29, 2024. Factual reporting on SNP's political challenges, including Sturgeon's resignation/arrest and Supreme Court's 2022 ruling against unilateral referendums. Contains opinions from named sources including journalist Andrew Neil and SNP MP Stewart McDonald.

5. **Politics Today** (March 31, 2023): Article covering Humza Yousaf becoming First Minister. Primarily factual reporting on his priorities and position on independence, with direct quotes from Yousaf and UK PM Sunak.

6. **The Guardian** (June 24, 2023): Reputable reporting on Yousaf's announcement that SNP victory in the next UK general election would be considered a mandate for independence. Factual reporting on SNP's strategy shift and polling data showing independence support at 48%.

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
1. **UK Supreme Court Ruling (2022)**: Court definitively ruled Scottish government lacks legal authority to hold independence referendum without Westminster consent. This remains a crucial institutional barrier.

2. **SNP Political Collapse (2024)**: Multiple sources confirm severe political instability:
   - Humza Yousaf resigned as First Minister on April 29, 2024
   - His minority coalition government collapsed
   - Former leader Nicola Sturgeon was arrested in a finance probe
   - Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell was charged with embezzlement

3. **Historical Timeline Requirements**: The 2014 referendum required:
   - Edinburgh Agreement (October 2012)
   - Section 30 order (January 2013)
   - Date announcement (March 2013) - 18 months before referendum
   
### Moderate Evidence
1. **Polling Status**: Multiple sources show independence support at approximately 48% (vs 52% against), showing neither decisive momentum nor collapse.

2. **SNP Strategy Evolution**: Documented shift from "de facto referendum" approach to using general election victory as mandate, indicating adaptation to political realities.

## Timeframe Analysis

Today is May 2, 2025, with approximately 60 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline. This timeframe is extremely compressed compared to historical precedent:

- The 2014 referendum announcement came 18 months before the actual vote
- The legal groundwork (Edinburgh Agreement, Section 30 order) took months to complete before announcement
- Even Sturgeon's proposed 2023 referendum (which didn't materialize) was announced over a year in advance

If the timeframe were halved (30 days), the probability would decrease significantly to near-zero, as there would be virtually no time for the necessary political and administrative processes.

If the timeframe were doubled (120 days), the probability would increase moderately, perhaps to 20-25%, but would still be constrained by the significant political challenges facing the SNP.

## Justification

Starting with my outside view prediction of 18%, I need to adjust based on current evidence:

### Factors Decreasing Probability:
1. **SNP Political Crisis**: The SNP appears to be in unprecedented disarray following Yousaf's April 2024 resignation, the coalition collapse, and the finance scandal engulfing former leaders. This instability severely hampers their ability to pursue constitutional initiatives.

2. **Legal Context**: While UK approval isn't necessary for resolution of this question, the Supreme Court ruling creates a context where Scottish officials would be announcing a referendum they lack legal authority to hold.

3. **Compressed Timeframe**: With only 60 days remaining, there is minimal time for the political preparation that has historically preceded referendum announcements.

4. **Failed Previous Attempts**: Despite several attempts since 2014, no second referendum has materialized, indicating significant barriers to progress.

### Factors Increasing Probability:
1. **Lower Resolution Bar**: The question only requires an announcement by Scottish authorities, not UK approval or an actual referendum occurring.

2. **Political Motivation**: A new SNP leadership could see a referendum announcement as a way to rally their base during a crisis period.

3. **Previous Unilateral Announcements**: There is precedent for unilateral announcements about referendum plans (e.g., Sturgeon's proposed 2023 date).

## Probability Calibration

The strongest factors influencing my prediction are:

1. The unprecedented political crisis within the SNP as of April 2024, leaving uncertainty about leadership and direction.

2. The extremely compressed 60-day timeframe compared to historical precedent for referendum processes.

3. The question's specific criteria requiring only an announcement, not legal approval or actual implementation.

The political instability and compressed timeframe are particularly significant downward factors. However, the lower bar set by the question (merely requiring an announcement by Scottish authorities) prevents the probability from approaching zero.

Given these considerations, I assess a 15% probability - slightly lower than my outside view of 18%. This represents that while not impossible, it remains quite unlikely that a Scottish authority figure would make such an announcement in the 60 days remaining, especially given the SNP's current leadership vacuum and internal turmoil.

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will a Scottish authority figure officially announce an independence referendum date before July 1, 2025? Resolution only requires Scottish announcement, not UK approval.
2. Base rate: 18% outside view based on historical processes and question specifics.
3. Consistency: 15 out of 100 times, a Scottish authority would announce a referendum date by July 1, 2025.
4. Key evidence: SNP political collapse (April 2024); 60-day timeframe much shorter than historical precedent; Supreme Court ruled against unilateral referendum powers; question requires only announcement, not implementation.
5. Blind spot: A new SNP leader could make immediate referendum announcement as bold political statement to rally base despite practical barriers.
6. Status quo: No referendum date is currently announced, and political instability makes maintaining this status quo likely.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **UK Parliament timeline (parliament.uk)**: Official government source providing a factual chronology of the 2014 referendum. Shows it took approximately 18 months from Edinburgh Agreement (Oct 2012) to referendum (Sep 2014). Highly reliable for procedural facts.

2. **LSE Blog (July 2022)**: Academic analysis of Sturgeon's 2022 strategy. Documents her introduction of draft legislation for October 2023 referendum and Supreme Court referral. Reliable for facts, though opinions are clearly attributed to the author.

3. **BBC News (June 2022)**: High-quality reporting on Sturgeon's formal proposal for October 2023 referendum and Supreme Court strategy. Includes authoritative polling analysis from Prof. Sir John Curtice. Reliable but now three years old.

4. **POLITICO (April 2024)**: Recent reporting on Yousaf's resignation and SNP leadership crisis. Notes the 2022 Supreme Court ruling against unilateral referendum powers. Contains reliable facts alongside clearly attributed expert opinions.

5. **Politics Today (March 2023)**: Reports on Yousaf's appointment as First Minister and his priorities. Less established source but factual content matches other reporting.

6. **The Guardian (June 2023)**: Reliable reporting on Yousaf's pivot from Sturgeon's "de facto referendum" plan to using general election wins as an independence mandate. Documents SNP internal troubles.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
- **UK Supreme Court ruling (2022)**: Multiple sources confirm the Court ruled Scotland lacks legal authority to hold a referendum without Westminster's consent. This formal, institutional barrier remains in place.
- **SNP leadership instability (2023-2024)**: Sturgeon resigned (Feb 2023), Yousaf took over then resigned (April 2024). The most recent reporting indicates a leadership vacuum with no clear successor established.
- **Historical timeline requirements**: The 2014 referendum required 18 months from agreement to vote. The Edinburgh Agreement (Oct 2012) and Section 30 order (Jan 2013) were essential precursors to the March 2013 date announcement.

### Moderate Evidence:
- **SNP strategic uncertainty**: Multiple sources document shifts from Sturgeon's October 2023 referendum plan to various "Plan B" approaches focusing on general elections as mandates.
- **SNP internal troubles**: Financial investigations and arrests of senior figures documented in multiple sources, hampering organizational capacity.
- **Sustained UK government opposition**: Consistent rejection of Section 30 orders across multiple years and prime ministers.

### Weak Evidence:
- **Independence polling**: Several sources indicate support hovering around 48%, showing neither decisive momentum nor collapse.
- **Political statements**: Various declarations of intent by SNP leaders that may not reflect actual capability.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question covers a 60-day window (May 2 - July 1, 2025). This timeframe is extraordinarily compressed compared to historical precedents:
- The 2014 referendum: 18 months from agreement to vote
- Sturgeon's 2022 plan: 16 months from announcement to proposed October 2023 vote
- Even Quebec's 1995 referendum: 8 months lead time

If the timeframe were halved (30 days), the probability would approach zero, as this would be logistically impossible.

If the timeframe were doubled (120 days), the probability would increase slightly but remain very low, as fundamental legal and political constraints would still apply.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view prediction of 5%, several factors significantly reduce probability:

1. **Leadership vacuum**: The most recent information (April 2024) indicates Yousaf resigned with no successor in place. No information suggests this situation has stabilized.

2. **Supreme Court precedent**: The 2022 ruling created a significant legal obstacle to unilateral action. While the question states UK legality doesn't affect resolution, this barrier makes Scottish government action much less likely.

3. **No active process**: None of the sources indicate any current legislative or political process that would culminate in a May-June 2025 announcement.

4. **Historical timeline compression**: The current 60-day window is vastly shorter than any precedent for referendum scheduling.

5. **Organizational disarray**: Financial investigations and leadership crises have severely disrupted SNP operations.

Only the specific resolution criteria (allowing for a unilateral Scottish announcement despite UK opposition) potentially increases probability, but this is heavily outweighed by practical constraints.

## Probability calibration

Given the leadership vacuum as of April 2024 (with no indication of resolution), the Supreme Court ruling, complete absence of any current legislative process, and the extremely compressed timeframe compared to historical precedents, I need to adjust the outside view probability downward. 

While the resolution criteria theoretically allow for a unilateral announcement, the practical obstacles are overwhelming. A 2% probability accurately reflects the extremely low but not impossible chance that Scottish authorities could make such an announcement in this timeframe.

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Scotland's government announce an independence referendum date before July 1, 2025 (60 days from now)?
2. Outside view: 5% base rate for referendum scheduling in this compressed timeframe.
3. Consistency: 2 out of 100 times, Scotland announces referendum date in next 60 days given current circumstances.
4. Key evidence: Leadership vacuum, Supreme Court ruling against unilateral powers, no active legislative process, historical timeline requirements of 8-18 months, SNP organizational disarray.
5. Blind spot: New SNP leader could have taken office since April 2024 and prioritized symbolic announcement despite legal barriers.
6. Status quo: No announcement is the status quo; short timeframe and barriers reinforce this outcome.

Probability: 2%
Predicted Probability: 2.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will Scotland’s government formally announce a date for an independence referendum by July 1, 2025?

2. Source analysis  
• Parliament.uk timeline (2014 referendum): authoritative government chronology—factual only, no opinions.  
• LSE/EUROPP blog (2022) & BBC (June 2022): expert summaries of Sturgeon’s plan for Oct 19 2023 vote—reliable but now outdated and plans failed.  
• Politico/Guardian (2023 – 2024): reporting Nicola Sturgeon’s/Salmond’s resignations, SNP decline, Yousaf’s collapse; mix of fact and identified expert opinions (Andrew Neil, Curtice).  
• Supreme Court ruling (late 2022): clear legal barrier to unilateral referendum—strong evidence of procedural hindrance.  

3. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
• Supreme Court decision (2022): Holyrood lacks power without Westminster consent.  
• Historical pattern: one successful referendum (2014) vs. multiple unsuccessful second-referendum attempts (2016–2023).  
Moderate evidence:  
• SNP + Green majority persists in Holyrood—means Scottish government *could* pass a bill unilaterally.  
• July 2024 UK general election outcome could alter mandate.  
Weak evidence:  
• SNP’s internal turmoil—unclear if new leadership prioritizes referendum.  
• Polling at 48% support—flat, no surge to build consensus.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: ~2 months (May 2 – July 1 2025).  
Compare shorter window: halved (1 month) → probability drops further (logistically impossible).  
Doubled window (4 months) → enough time to draft/announce referendum legislation → probability maybe +5–10 points.  

5. Justification  
Outside view base rate: zero referendums announced since 2014 except the failed 2023 attempt → baseline ~10–15%.  
Shifts down:  
• Supreme Court ruling and Westminster opposition are durable structural barriers.  
• No significant polling surge, EU-style momentum, or cross-party consensus (unlike 2014).  
Shifts up:  
• SNP+Greens majority—Scottish government could override UK consent.  
• Potential pro-independence UK election result (July 2024) could be spun as mandate → might trigger announcement early 2025.  

Net effect: small upward adjustment from a “practically zero” baseline given majority but countered by time constraints and political fragility.  

Probability calibration  
Starting base rate ≈ 10% (no precedent for quick, unilateral scheduling).  
+5% for Scottish government’s de jure majority (could force an announcement).  
–3% for extremely tight deadline and leadership instability.  
= 12% ≈ round to 15% to reflect residual uncertainty around July 2024 election shock.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase check ✅  
2. Base rate: one success in one case (2014) vs. zero since → ~10% baseline ✅  
3. Consistency: “About 15 out of 100 times, Scotland’s government announces a date by July 1, 2025.” ✅  
4. Key evidence (≤5):  
   • Supreme Court blockade (strong)  
   • SNP+Green majority (moderate)  
   • Tight 2-month window (strong)  
   • No polling surge (moderate)  
   • July 2024 election shock (weak)  
5. Blind-spot: Unforeseen UK government collapse leading to negotiated referendum→ could raise probability to 40%.

   Question: By July 1, 2025, will Scotland’s government officially announce a date for an independence referendum?  
   Resolution: Yes if a person or entity with Scottish authority declares a specific referendum date by that cutoff.

2. Outside-View Base-Rate  
   Reference class: Subnational governments scheduling major sovereignty referendums.  
   – Scotland 2014: ~18 months’ lead time after agreement.

      • Type: Biographical profile of Humza Yousaf.  
      • Facts: Leadership vote, policy priorities, legal challenges.  
      • Opinions: Minor analytical statements.  

4. Evidence Analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence  
   – Supreme Court ruling (late 2022): Holyrood lacks competence without Westminster consent; no new Section 30 order on table.  
   – Historical lead times: 2014 required >12 months between announcement and vote.  
   – Institutional opposition: UK government (PM Sunak) firmly opposes any new referendum.  
   Moderate evidence  
   – SNP’s weakened position: low polling (~29%), leadership change Feb 2025, focus on Holyrood election 2026.  
   – No bilateral talks underway for legal mechanism.  
   Weak evidence  
   – Rhetorical “Plan B” of treating a general election as a plebiscite (not an official scheduling).  
   – Academic critiques of SNP strategy (not direct scheduling signals).  

5. Timeframe Analysis  
   – Today: May 2, 2025. Deadline: July 1, 2025 (≈60 days).  
   – Historical analog: scheduling requires a legislative bill, consultation, franchise regulations, campaign period – typically ≥6 months.  
   – If timeframe were half (30 days), probability shrinks further; if doubled (120 days), still legal and parliamentary obstacles remain high, but marginally more room.  

6. Justification and Inside-View Adjustment  
   – Legal barrier: No Section 30 consent, Supreme Court blocked competence. No fresh mechanism likely within 2 months (Strong).  
   – Political capacity: SNP leadership transition and low public support divert focus to Holyrood 2026, not a rushed mid-year referendum (Moderate).  
   – Procedural inertia: drafting, passing, and certifying a referendum bill in 60 days is unprecedented (Strong).  
   – Tail risk: A sudden deal or breakthrough is conceivable but extremely unlikely given entrenched positions (Weak).  
   These factors warrant a small upward adjustment from the out-view floor (~1%) to account for tail-risk of surprise scheduling.  

Probability calibration  
Outside-view base rate: ~1–3%  
Inside-view adjustments: +1 pp for low-probability tail risk  
Final probability: 2%

   • No Section 30 order nor UK consent (Strong)

5. Blind-spot: A sudden UK-Scottish deal on a Section 30 order could upend prediction—but no current signals point to that.  
6. Status quo: No announcement expected; world moving slowly with entrenched positions.

• Politics Today (Mar-2023). Small think-tank site; basic biography of Yousaf. Adequate for factual milestones; minimal effect on forecast.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
1. UK Supreme Court (Nov-2022) ruled Holyrood lacks competence to legislate a referendum unilaterally – structural legal barrier.  
2. Only one historical scheduling (2013) in 26 years of devolution – base rate ≈ 3.8 % per year, none with <3-month notice.  
3. Administrative lead time: Electoral Commission normally requires 6-12 months; 60 days left.

Moderate evidence  
4. SNP minority government collapsed Apr-2024; party divided, support falling – lowers political capacity to pursue a vote.  
5. Possible UK Labour government after late-2024 election might in principle grant a Section 30 order – small upside path.

Weak evidence  
6. Independence polling plateau ~48 %; public pressure neither collapsing nor surging – limited short-term effect.  
7. Talk of using a UK general election as “de facto referendum” shows leadership focusing on alternative routes rather than scheduling an actual referendum.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time remaining: 60 days (to 1 July 2025). Halving to 30 days would cut probability roughly in half again, as legislative windows narrow. Doubling to 120 days (if the deadline were later) would raise odds modestly (~×2-3) but still leave them well under 5 %, given structural/legal hurdles.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start with outside view 0.3 % (1-in-330) for a date being announced inside a 60-day window.  
Adjustments:  
+0.2 % for unknown 2024-25 developments (e.g., a pro-referendum deal with a new UK Labour government) – moderate evidence.  
-0.1 % for SNP organisational weakness and loss of Holyrood majority – moderate negative evidence.  
Net inside-view ≈ 0.4 %.  
Round conservatively upward to 1 % to acknowledge tail risk that a rapid Westminster–Holyrood agreement emerges and Holyrood immediately announces a 2026 date.

Probability calibration
I expect that 1 out of 100 similar two-month periods would see the Scottish Government legally empowered and promptly announcing a referendum date. Uncertainty band roughly ±0.8 pp (80 % confidence interval 0.2-1.8 %).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Scotland’s government announce an independence-referendum date before 1 Jul 2025?  
2. Base rate: 0.3 % for a 60-day window (derived from 1 success in 26 yrs).  
3. Consistency: “1 out of 100 times, a date is announced within the next 60 days.”  
4. Key evidence: Supreme-Court ruling; 60-day logistic window; SNP collapse Apr-2024; no Section 30 order yet; historical 18-month lead in 2013.  
5. Blind-spot: A surprise UK-Labour/Scottish-Labour-SNP pact fast-tracks a Section 30 order and Holyrood instantly names a 2026 date.  
6. Status-quo bias: Current trajectory (no Section 30, fractured SNP) strongly favours “No”; small nudge toward status-quo retained.

## Source Analysis

1. **Parliament.uk Timeline** (unknown date): High-quality official government source presenting factual chronology of Scottish independence developments from 1707-2016. Contains purely factual information without opinions.

2. **LSE EUROPP Blog** (July 26, 2022): Academic article from London School of Economics analyzing Sturgeon's June 2022 referendum strategy. Provides factual reporting on the draft legislation for October 2023 referendum and Supreme Court referral. Contains identified opinion from author Anthony Salamone calling the strategy "a major gamble."

3. **BBC News** (June 28, 2022): High-quality reporting on Sturgeon's formal proposal for October 2023 referendum. Includes factual details about proposed referendum, Supreme Court referral, and polling (from expert Prof. Sir John Curtice). Contains identified opinions from named political figures (Boris Johnson, opposition leaders).

4. **POLITICO Article** (likely April/May 2024): Reputable political reporting covering Humza Yousaf's resignation on April 29, 2024. Factual reporting on SNP's political challenges, including Sturgeon's resignation/arrest and Supreme Court's 2022 ruling against unilateral referendums. Contains opinions from named sources including journalist Andrew Neil and SNP MP Stewart McDonald.

5. **Politics Today** (March 31, 2023): Article covering Humza Yousaf becoming First Minister. Primarily factual reporting on his priorities and position on independence, with direct quotes from Yousaf and UK PM Sunak.

6. **The Guardian** (June 24, 2023): Reputable reporting on Yousaf's announcement that SNP victory in the next UK general election would be considered a mandate for independence. Factual reporting on SNP's strategy shift and polling data showing independence support at 48%.

## Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
1. **UK Supreme Court Ruling (2022)**: Court definitively ruled Scottish government lacks legal authority to hold independence referendum without Westminster consent. This remains a crucial institutional barrier.

2. **SNP Political Collapse (2024)**: Multiple sources confirm severe political instability:
   - Humza Yousaf resigned as First Minister on April 29, 2024
   - His minority coalition government collapsed
   - Former leader Nicola Sturgeon was arrested in a finance probe
   - Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell was charged with embezzlement

3. **Historical Timeline Requirements**: The 2014 referendum required:
   - Edinburgh Agreement (October 2012)
   - Section 30 order (January 2013)
   - Date announcement (March 2013) - 18 months before referendum
   
### Moderate Evidence
1. **Polling Status**: Multiple sources show independence support at approximately 48% (vs 52% against), showing neither decisive momentum nor collapse.

2. **SNP Strategy Evolution**: Documented shift from "de facto referendum" approach to using general election victory as mandate, indicating adaptation to political realities.

## Timeframe Analysis

Today is May 2, 2025, with approximately 60 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline. This timeframe is extremely compressed compared to historical precedent:

- The 2014 referendum announcement came 18 months before the actual vote
- The legal groundwork (Edinburgh Agreement, Section 30 order) took months to complete before announcement
- Even Sturgeon's proposed 2023 referendum (which didn't materialize) was announced over a year in advance

If the timeframe were halved (30 days), the probability would decrease significantly to near-zero, as there would be virtually no time for the necessary political and administrative processes.

If the timeframe were doubled (120 days), the probability would increase moderately, perhaps to 20-25%, but would still be constrained by the significant political challenges facing the SNP.

## Justification

Starting with my outside view prediction of 18%, I need to adjust based on current evidence:

### Factors Decreasing Probability:
1. **SNP Political Crisis**: The SNP appears to be in unprecedented disarray following Yousaf's April 2024 resignation, the coalition collapse, and the finance scandal engulfing former leaders. This instability severely hampers their ability to pursue constitutional initiatives.

2. **Legal Context**: While UK approval isn't necessary for resolution of this question, the Supreme Court ruling creates a context where Scottish officials would be announcing a referendum they lack legal authority to hold.

3. **Compressed Timeframe**: With only 60 days remaining, there is minimal time for the political preparation that has historically preceded referendum announcements.

4. **Failed Previous Attempts**: Despite several attempts since 2014, no second referendum has materialized, indicating significant barriers to progress.

### Factors Increasing Probability:
1. **Lower Resolution Bar**: The question only requires an announcement by Scottish authorities, not UK approval or an actual referendum occurring.

2. **Political Motivation**: A new SNP leadership could see a referendum announcement as a way to rally their base during a crisis period.

3. **Previous Unilateral Announcements**: There is precedent for unilateral announcements about referendum plans (e.g., Sturgeon's proposed 2023 date).

## Probability Calibration

The strongest factors influencing my prediction are:

1. The unprecedented political crisis within the SNP as of April 2024, leaving uncertainty about leadership and direction.

2. The extremely compressed 60-day timeframe compared to historical precedent for referendum processes.

3. The question's specific criteria requiring only an announcement, not legal approval or actual implementation.

The political instability and compressed timeframe are particularly significant downward factors. However, the lower bar set by the question (merely requiring an announcement by Scottish authorities) prevents the probability from approaching zero.

Given these considerations, I assess a 15% probability - slightly lower than my outside view of 18%. This represents that while not impossible, it remains quite unlikely that a Scottish authority figure would make such an announcement in the 60 days remaining, especially given the SNP's current leadership vacuum and internal turmoil.

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will a Scottish authority figure officially announce an independence referendum date before July 1, 2025? Resolution only requires Scottish announcement, not UK approval.
2. Base rate: 18% outside view based on historical processes and question specifics.
3. Consistency: 15 out of 100 times, a Scottish authority would announce a referendum date by July 1, 2025.
4. Key evidence: SNP political collapse (April 2024); 60-day timeframe much shorter than historical precedent; Supreme Court ruled against unilateral referendum powers; question requires only announcement, not implementation.
5. Blind spot: A new SNP leader could make immediate referendum announcement as bold political statement to rally base despite practical barriers.
6. Status quo: No referendum date is currently announced, and political instability makes maintaining this status quo likely.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **UK Parliament timeline (parliament.uk)**: Official government source providing a factual chronology of the 2014 referendum. Shows it took approximately 18 months from Edinburgh Agreement (Oct 2012) to referendum (Sep 2014). Highly reliable for procedural facts.

2. **LSE Blog (July 2022)**: Academic analysis of Sturgeon's 2022 strategy. Documents her introduction of draft legislation for October 2023 referendum and Supreme Court referral. Reliable for facts, though opinions are clearly attributed to the author.

3. **BBC News (June 2022)**: High-quality reporting on Sturgeon's formal proposal for October 2023 referendum and Supreme Court strategy. Includes authoritative polling analysis from Prof. Sir John Curtice. Reliable but now three years old.

4. **POLITICO (April 2024)**: Recent reporting on Yousaf's resignation and SNP leadership crisis. Notes the 2022 Supreme Court ruling against unilateral referendum powers. Contains reliable facts alongside clearly attributed expert opinions.

5. **Politics Today (March 2023)**: Reports on Yousaf's appointment as First Minister and his priorities. Less established source but factual content matches other reporting.

6. **The Guardian (June 2023)**: Reliable reporting on Yousaf's pivot from Sturgeon's "de facto referendum" plan to using general election wins as an independence mandate. Documents SNP internal troubles.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
- **UK Supreme Court ruling (2022)**: Multiple sources confirm the Court ruled Scotland lacks legal authority to hold a referendum without Westminster's consent. This formal, institutional barrier remains in place.
- **SNP leadership instability (2023-2024)**: Sturgeon resigned (Feb 2023), Yousaf took over then resigned (April 2024). The most recent reporting indicates a leadership vacuum with no clear successor established.
- **Historical timeline requirements**: The 2014 referendum required 18 months from agreement to vote. The Edinburgh Agreement (Oct 2012) and Section 30 order (Jan 2013) were essential precursors to the March 2013 date announcement.

### Moderate Evidence:
- **SNP strategic uncertainty**: Multiple sources document shifts from Sturgeon's October 2023 referendum plan to various "Plan B" approaches focusing on general elections as mandates.
- **SNP internal troubles**: Financial investigations and arrests of senior figures documented in multiple sources, hampering organizational capacity.
- **Sustained UK government opposition**: Consistent rejection of Section 30 orders across multiple years and prime ministers.

### Weak Evidence:
- **Independence polling**: Several sources indicate support hovering around 48%, showing neither decisive momentum nor collapse.
- **Political statements**: Various declarations of intent by SNP leaders that may not reflect actual capability.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question covers a 60-day window (May 2 - July 1, 2025). This timeframe is extraordinarily compressed compared to historical precedents:
- The 2014 referendum: 18 months from agreement to vote
- Sturgeon's 2022 plan: 16 months from announcement to proposed October 2023 vote
- Even Quebec's 1995 referendum: 8 months lead time

If the timeframe were halved (30 days), the probability would approach zero, as this would be logistically impossible.

If the timeframe were doubled (120 days), the probability would increase slightly but remain very low, as fundamental legal and political constraints would still apply.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view prediction of 5%, several factors significantly reduce probability:

1. **Leadership vacuum**: The most recent information (April 2024) indicates Yousaf resigned with no successor in place. No information suggests this situation has stabilized.

2. **Supreme Court precedent**: The 2022 ruling created a significant legal obstacle to unilateral action. While the question states UK legality doesn't affect resolution, this barrier makes Scottish government action much less likely.

3. **No active process**: None of the sources indicate any current legislative or political process that would culminate in a May-June 2025 announcement.

4. **Historical timeline compression**: The current 60-day window is vastly shorter than any precedent for referendum scheduling.

5. **Organizational disarray**: Financial investigations and leadership crises have severely disrupted SNP operations.

Only the specific resolution criteria (allowing for a unilateral Scottish announcement despite UK opposition) potentially increases probability, but this is heavily outweighed by practical constraints.

## Probability calibration

Given the leadership vacuum as of April 2024 (with no indication of resolution), the Supreme Court ruling, complete absence of any current legislative process, and the extremely compressed timeframe compared to historical precedents, I need to adjust the outside view probability downward. 

While the resolution criteria theoretically allow for a unilateral announcement, the practical obstacles are overwhelming. A 2% probability accurately reflects the extremely low but not impossible chance that Scottish authorities could make such an announcement in this timeframe.

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Scotland's government announce an independence referendum date before July 1, 2025 (60 days from now)?
2. Outside view: 5% base rate for referendum scheduling in this compressed timeframe.
3. Consistency: 2 out of 100 times, Scotland announces referendum date in next 60 days given current circumstances.
4. Key evidence: Leadership vacuum, Supreme Court ruling against unilateral powers, no active legislative process, historical timeline requirements of 8-18 months, SNP organizational disarray.
5. Blind spot: New SNP leader could have taken office since April 2024 and prioritized symbolic announcement despite legal barriers.
6. Status quo: No announcement is the status quo; short timeframe and barriers reinforce this outcome.

Probability: 2%
Predicted Probability: 2.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will Scotland’s government formally announce a date for an independence referendum by July 1, 2025?

2. Source analysis  
• Parliament.uk timeline (2014 referendum): authoritative government chronology—factual only, no opinions.  
• LSE/EUROPP blog (2022) & BBC (June 2022): expert summaries of Sturgeon’s plan for Oct 19 2023 vote—reliable but now outdated and plans failed.  
• Politico/Guardian (2023 – 2024): reporting Nicola Sturgeon’s/Salmond’s resignations, SNP decline, Yousaf’s collapse; mix of fact and identified expert opinions (Andrew Neil, Curtice).  
• Supreme Court ruling (late 2022): clear legal barrier to unilateral referendum—strong evidence of procedural hindrance.  

3. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
• Supreme Court decision (2022): Holyrood lacks power without Westminster consent.  
• Historical pattern: one successful referendum (2014) vs. multiple unsuccessful second-referendum attempts (2016–2023).  
Moderate evidence:  
• SNP + Green majority persists in Holyrood—means Scottish government *could* pass a bill unilaterally.  
• July 2024 UK general election outcome could alter mandate.  
Weak evidence:  
• SNP’s internal turmoil—unclear if new leadership prioritizes referendum.  
• Polling at 48% support—flat, no surge to build consensus.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: ~2 months (May 2 – July 1 2025).  
Compare shorter window: halved (1 month) → probability drops further (logistically impossible).  
Doubled window (4 months) → enough time to draft/announce referendum legislation → probability maybe +5–10 points.  

5. Justification  
Outside view base rate: zero referendums announced since 2014 except the failed 2023 attempt → baseline ~10–15%.  
Shifts down:  
• Supreme Court ruling and Westminster opposition are durable structural barriers.  
• No significant polling surge, EU-style momentum, or cross-party consensus (unlike 2014).  
Shifts up:  
• SNP+Greens majority—Scottish government could override UK consent.  
• Potential pro-independence UK election result (July 2024) could be spun as mandate → might trigger announcement early 2025.  

Net effect: small upward adjustment from a “practically zero” baseline given majority but countered by time constraints and political fragility.  

Probability calibration  
Starting base rate ≈ 10% (no precedent for quick, unilateral scheduling).  
+5% for Scottish government’s de jure majority (could force an announcement).  
–3% for extremely tight deadline and leadership instability.  
= 12% ≈ round to 15% to reflect residual uncertainty around July 2024 election shock.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase check ✅  
2. Base rate: one success in one case (2014) vs. zero since → ~10% baseline ✅  
3. Consistency: “About 15 out of 100 times, Scotland’s government announces a date by July 1, 2025.” ✅  
4. Key evidence (≤5):  
   • Supreme Court blockade (strong)  
   • SNP+Green majority (moderate)  
   • Tight 2-month window (strong)  
   • No polling surge (moderate)  
   • July 2024 election shock (weak)  
5. Blind-spot: Unforeseen UK government collapse leading to negotiated referendum→ could raise probability to 40%.  
6. Status quo: No announcement so far; unchanged conditions favor No. ✅

   Question: By July 1, 2025, will Scotland’s government officially announce a date for an independence referendum?  
   Resolution: Yes if a person or entity with Scottish authority declares a specific referendum date by that cutoff.

2. Outside-View Base-Rate  
   Reference class: Subnational governments scheduling major sovereignty referendums.  
   – Scotland 2014: ~18 months’ lead time after agreement.

      • Type: Official government publication.  
      • Value: Detailed procedural precedent (Section 30, legislative timeline, announcement lead time).

      • Type: Biographical profile of Humza Yousaf.  
      • Facts: Leadership vote, policy priorities, legal challenges.  
      • Opinions: Minor analytical statements.  

4. Evidence Analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence  
   – Supreme Court ruling (late 2022): Holyrood lacks competence without Westminster consent; no new Section 30 order on table.  
   – Historical lead times: 2014 required >12 months between announcement and vote.  
   – Institutional opposition: UK government (PM Sunak) firmly opposes any new referendum.  
   Moderate evidence  
   – SNP’s weakened position: low polling (~29%), leadership change Feb 2025, focus on Holyrood election 2026.  
   – No bilateral talks underway for legal mechanism.  
   Weak evidence  
   – Rhetorical “Plan B” of treating a general election as a plebiscite (not an official scheduling).  
   – Academic critiques of SNP strategy (not direct scheduling signals).  

5. Timeframe Analysis  
   – Today: May 2, 2025. Deadline: July 1, 2025 (≈60 days).  
   – Historical analog: scheduling requires a legislative bill, consultation, franchise regulations, campaign period – typically ≥6 months.  
   – If timeframe were half (30 days), probability shrinks further; if doubled (120 days), still legal and parliamentary obstacles remain high, but marginally more room.  

6. Justification and Inside-View Adjustment  
   – Legal barrier: No Section 30 consent, Supreme Court blocked competence. No fresh mechanism likely within 2 months (Strong).  
   – Political capacity: SNP leadership transition and low public support divert focus to Holyrood 2026, not a rushed mid-year referendum (Moderate).  
   – Procedural inertia: drafting, passing, and certifying a referendum bill in 60 days is unprecedented (Strong).  
   – Tail risk: A sudden deal or breakthrough is conceivable but extremely unlikely given entrenched positions (Weak).  
   These factors warrant a small upward adjustment from the out-view floor (~1%) to account for tail-risk of surprise scheduling.  

Probability calibration  
Outside-view base rate: ~1–3%  
Inside-view adjustments: +1 pp for low-probability tail risk  
Final probability: 2%

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast if Scotland officially schedules an independence referendum by July 1, 2025.  
2. Base rate: Subnational referendum scheduling with short lead times ≈1–3%.  
3. Consistency: “2 out of 100 times, a short-notice referendum is officially scheduled.”  
4. Key evidence:

   • Historical requirement ≥6 months lead (Strong)  
   • No Section 30 order nor UK consent (Strong)  
   • SNP preoccupied with 2026 election, low polling (Moderate)
