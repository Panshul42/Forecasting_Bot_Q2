Analysis:
The key to establishing an outside‐view baseline is understanding the history and pattern of phone communications between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They spoke multiple times during Trump’s presidency (notably starting July 2019), but the last confirmed call was in January 2020. Since leaving office, Trump has had no known direct phone contact with Zelenskyy, while Zelenskyy has instead communicated primarily with incumbent leaders. The status quo suggests no calls unless a novel political impetus arises (e.g., campaign outreach or mediation offers). To refine this baseline, we need:
• A chronological list of all past Trump–Zelenskyy calls (dates and contexts).  
• Any developments or statements since January 2021 about potential calls.  
• Patterns of post‐presidential outreach by Trump on foreign policy, especially regarding Ukraine.

Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether Trump and Zelenskyy will speak by June 15, 2025 is to track any signals or announcements from both camps about coordination or bilateral communications. Relevant information includes: official statements from the Ukrainian presidency or Trump campaign, scheduling of international events where calls might be coordinated, and expert commentary on U.S.-Ukraine relations under a potential Trump administration. We need to identify any recent news indicating planned or tentative phone calls, as well as positions or conditions laid out by either side for such a conversation. Capturing updates from major wire services (Reuters, AP), statements on official websites, and coverage in political outlets (Politico, CNN) will inform our inside-view adjustment to the baseline probability.

Disclaimer: Summary based solely on the provided Wikipedia excerpt, which appears cut off mid-sentence and may omit some details.

Key facts and figures  
• Meeting date and setting: February 28, 2025, live-televised bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, White House, Washington, D.C.  
• Participants: U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  
• Intended outcome: Discuss continued U.S. support for Ukraine and conclude a Ukraine–U.S. Mineral Resources Agreement. Meeting ended abruptly without resolution.  
• Final minutes: Trump and Vance repeatedly criticized Zelenskyy, at times drowning out his voice—widely described by media outlets as an unprecedented public confrontation between an American president and a foreign head of state.  

Background and lead-up  
• Trump’s position: Pushed Ukraine to agree to an immediate ceasefire with Russia before security guarantees; had at times implied Ukraine bore responsibility for Russia’s invasion and called Zelenskyy a “dictator” (later retracted). Expressed willingness to negotiate directly with Putin, reversing prior U.S. policy of isolating Russia.  
• Zelenskyy’s position: Insisted on strong security guarantees against future Russian aggression before any ceasefire, fearing Putin would break agreements.  
• Historical context: Russo-Ukrainian War began with Crimea’s annexation in 2014 and escalated with Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. By 2025 Ukraine heavily relied on Western aid.  

Domestic and international reactions  
• U.S. allies and global figures: Nearly all voiced support for Zelenskyy and rebuked Trump’s confrontational tone.  
• Russia: Officials praised the meeting’s outcome and criticized Zelenskyy; Russian media expressed shock at the public clash.  
• U.S. partisan split: Most Republicans commended Trump’s conduct; most Democrats condemned it.  
• Poll (YouGov, March 2025): 51% of Americans felt Trump was disrespectful toward Zelenskyy; 32% felt Zelenskyy was disrespectful toward Trump.  

Aftermath  
• Aid suspension: Trump administration paused U.S. intelligence and military aid to Ukraine for about one week.  
• Ceasefire proposal: Aid resumed after Zelenskyy agreed to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire (Russia rejected, so it did not take effect).  

Aid figures and fiscal context  
• Trump claims vs. fact-checks: Trump asserted “about $350 billion” spent on Ukraine; fact-checkers and the Congressional Research Service report $83 billion disbursed, $57 billion obligated, $40 billion appropriated, with total appropriations of $182 billion (2022–2024).  
• Alternative tallies:  
 – Kiel Institute (via BBC): U.S. spent $119.7 billion in aid Jan 2022–Dec 2024; DoD cites $182.8 billion covering Operation Atlantic Resolve.  
 – U.S. News: total U.S. aid commitment about $128 billion.  
• Aid structure: U.S. has provided more grants than loans.  

Related developments  
• Trump’s first-day executive order: Froze all foreign humanitarian aid for 90 days; defied court order to lift the freeze. USAID had pledged $16.4 billion in humanitarian aid to Ukraine in 2023.  
• 2019 history: Trump was impeached for withholding arms to pressure Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden.  
• VP Vance: In a 2022 interview said, “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.” Zelenskyy in 2024 called Vance “too radical.”  
• Diplomacy and minerals agreement:  
 – Trump urged Ukraine to share raw-minerals revenues with the U.S.  
 – Ukraine planned a framework minerals agreement (originally proposed to Biden in 2024) and in Jan 2025 signed a 100-year U.K. minerals partnership.  
 – Senator Lindsey Graham advised Zelenskyy to focus on minerals now and address ceasefire later. The proposed deal would create a joint investment fund rebuilding Ukraine, with Ukraine contributing half of future resource revenues and the U.S. gaining rare-earth mining rights. Graham and others mediated to keep Trump engaged in Ukraine’s security.  
• Protocol note: Trump’s entourage requested Zelenskyy wear a formal suit for the meeting.

Here’s a concise summary of the AP News article “Trump and Zelenskyy through the years: From a ‘perfect’ call to pausing US assistance to Ukraine” (March 1, 2025):

Facts & statistics  
• In July 2019, Trump’s 30-minute call with newly inaugurated Ukrainian President Zelenskyy included Trump suggesting future U.S. military aid be tied to digging up dirt on Hunter Biden.  
• That exchange led to Trump’s December 2019 impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House (abuse of power and obstruction of justice); he was acquitted by the Senate.  
• Russia’s full-scale invasion began February 24, 2022. Since then, the U.S. has appropriated over $180 billion in military aid and other assistance to Ukraine.  
• Before March 2025, Zelenskyy had visited the White House four times—each under President Biden—and met Trump twice (September 2024 at Trump Tower, December 2024 in Paris).  

Reliable, named-source opinions & statements  
• Trump on the July 2019 call: he later called it a “perfect” phone call; Zelenskyy said he faced “no blackmail.”  
• December 2022, Zelenskyy (to U.S. Congress): “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy…”  
• Trump (campaigning in 2022): Russia “would never have invaded Ukraine if I’d been president.”  
• September 2024, after Zelenskyy’s visits to Pennsylvania and Trump Tower, Trump (to Fox News): “It should stop and the president [Zelenskyy] wants it to stop … And I’m sure President Putin wants it to stop…”  
• Trump (March 2025), when Zelenskyy announced he’d come to Washington to sign a critical-minerals agreement: called U.S. support for Ukraine “a very worthy thing to do.”  
• Trump (pressed on calling Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections”): feigned surprise, “Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that. Next question.”  
• Vice President J.D. Vance (March 2025): argued a minerals-for-security deal “is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country…”  

March 2025 developments  
• After a tense Oval Office meeting in late February 2025—during which Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of insufficient gratitude for U.S. aid—Trump ordered a “pause” in U.S. assistance to pressure Ukraine into negotiations to end the war.  
• Zelenskyy, acknowledging the war “is still very, very far away,” says any peace agreement will take time.

<Summary source="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/11/world/europe/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-talks-putin-zelensky.html">
Here are the key points from the May 11, 2025 New York Times article “Zelensky Demands Cease-Fire in Response to Putin’s Call for Direct Talks,” reporting from Kyiv:

1. Context and European plan  
   • During a weekend visit to Kyiv, the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland proposed a 30-day cease-fire in Ukraine.  
   • They set a deadline of Monday for Russia to accept that cease-fire or face additional sanctions.  
   • That cease-fire plan had originally been put forward by the Trump administration.

2. Putin’s counteroffer  
   • President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia declined to include a cease-fire and instead proposed “direct talks” with Ukraine.  
   • He suggested Turkey as host but did not mention any truce or presidential meeting.

3. European response  
   • France and Germany immediately rebuffed Putin’s proposal for talks without first halting the fighting.

4. U.S. involvement and Trump’s intervention  
   • Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy in the Ukraine negotiations, had said earlier on Sunday that Russia should stop hostilities before negotiations.  
   • Later that day, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social:  
     – “President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine. He wants direct talks to be hosted by Turkey instead. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY.”

5. Zelensky’s position  
   • President Volodymyr Zelensky responded cautiously to Putin’s offer, reiterating his insistence on an immediate halt to the fighting.  
   • After seeing Trump’s post, Zelensky announced (in a post on X) that he would personally attend negotiations—though he did not clarify whether that depended on Russia first agreeing to a cease-fire.  

No additional material has been added; this summary reflects the article’s reporting and direct quotations.

<Summary source="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/19/trump-zelensky-phone-call/">
Here is a summary of the Washington Post article by Michael Birnbaum (March 19, 2025):

• Ceasefire agreement  
  – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to a 30-day partial ceasefire with Russia focused on “energy and other civilian infrastructure.”  
  – He said this was a “first step” toward “lasting peace” more than three years into the invasion.  

• Trump–Zelensky phone call  
  – The agreement followed an hour-long call between Zelensky and former President Donald Trump.  
  – Both leaders described the call as positive. Zelensky called it “the most substantive and positive one in recent times.”  
  – Trump posted on Truth Social: “Just completed a very good telephone call with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine,” and said it built on his call with Putin to “align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs.”  

• Uncertainty over Russian compliance  
  – The Kremlin had announced only a narrower pause on “energy infrastructure” strikes; White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted the U.S. account was correct.  
  – Zelensky remained skeptical, noting 107 Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones were in flight over Ukraine as he spoke.  

• U.S. military and political support  
  – Leavitt said the U.S. would resume military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv after a recent pause.  
  – Trump “agreed to work with [Zelensky] to find what was available” in Europe, especially Patriot air‐defense systems.  
  – Leavitt also said the two discussed U.S. interest in owning and operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants.  

• Prisoner exchange and ongoing fighting  
  – Ukraine and Russia swapped 175 prisoners on Wednesday, part of Tuesday’s discussions with Russia.  
  – Despite claims of an “air truce,” Ukraine reported continued Russian strikes overnight, including:  
    – A March 18 attack on Slovyansk’s electricity grid at 8:50 p.m., damaging power lines and a gas pipeline.  
    – A wave of 145 Russian drones hitting two hospitals in Sumy region and nine homes in Bucha.  
  – Ukraine retaliated by striking an oil depot in Russia’s Krasnodar region, prompting a major fire.  

• Kyiv’s reaction and skepticism  
  – Ukrainian officials were not briefed on Trump’s call with Putin until the next day and expressed doubt Putin would honor any commitments.  
  – Zelensky adviser Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on X that less than an hour after Putin’s alleged order to halt energy strikes, Russia attacked civilian infrastructure with 150 Shahed drones.  

• Broader context  
  – This outreach follows Trump’s recent overtures to Putin and a shift from earlier White House hostility toward Zelensky.  
  – Last month, Trump had called Zelensky a “dictator” and told him “you don’t have the cards right now.”

<Summary source="https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-trump-discuss-war-pressure-on-russia/">
Here is a concise summary of the Kyiv Independent’s May 9, 2025 article “Zelensky, Trump discuss ceasefire, pressure on Russia in phone call.” All attributions are as given in the article.

1. Negotiations and diplomacy  
 • Kremlin: Russia will name its representative for the expected Istanbul talks once Putin “deems it necessary.”  
 • Presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak (on the Breakfast Show, May 13): Zelensky will meet only Vladimir Putin among Russian officials in Istanbul this week.  
 • Bloomberg sources (May 12): U.S. officials told European counterparts they prefer to allow Russia-Ukraine talks before increasing pressure on Putin.  
 • Steve Witkoff (unnamed affiliation): key peace-talk topics are the five occupied Ukrainian regions, the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, and Ukraine’s access to the Dnipro River and Black Sea.  
 • Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa is reportedly offering U.S. companies access to Syrian natural resources—analogous to Washington’s recent minerals agreement with Kyiv.

2. Sanctions and economic measures  
 • EU sanctions on Russia expire end-July unless all 27 member states agree to extend them.  
 • EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius: only member states can borrow under the €150 billion instrument, though funds may be used for joint procurement with Ukraine. Member states agreed to measures to cut Kremlin revenues, disrupt the shadow fleet, tighten the oil price cap, and reduce Russian energy imports.

3. Military developments  
 • Ukraine’s Air Force: shot down all 10 drones Russia launched overnight.  
 • Russia attacked with drones and guided bombs after the May 12 deadline for an unconditional ceasefire expired.  
 • Special Operations Forces’ reconnaissance operators detected Buk-M3 and Uragan-1 systems on combat duty in an unspecified front-line sector.  
 • The article cites 1,070 Russian casualties over the previous day (source unspecified).

4. Security and personnel  
 • In spring 2025, an unnamed suspect who had quit his job at Rivne NPP before the war was approached by a GRU liaison offering money in exchange for cooperation.  
 • On May 12, Zelensky removed Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk from the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Ukraine’s top defense command.

5. Zelensky–Trump phone call (May 8)  
 • Reported by Zelensky in his nightly address: he spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss the war, continued pressure on Russia, and a potential ceasefire.  
 • Zelensky described the call as “good,” “warm and constructive.” Both leaders congratulated each other on Victory in Europe Day.  
 • Key discussion points: U.S. support for Ukraine; pressuring Russia; frontline situation; diplomatic efforts; “a real and lasting ceasefire.”  
 • Zelensky quotes:  
   – “Ukraine is ready for a full ceasefire starting right now, from this very moment.”  
   – “America can help… the world needs America now just as it did eighty years ago.”  
 • The call follows U.S. efforts to broker peace: Ukraine had accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire nearly two months earlier, which Russia rejected while demanding a halt to military aid. Kyiv has dismissed Russia’s peace-talk overtures as propaganda amid intensified attacks.

# Chronological Account of Phone Communications Between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy  

### Summary of Key Findings  
Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in multiple consequential phone calls between 2019 and 2025, beginning with interactions that catalyzed Trump’s first impeachment and evolving into discussions about ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These communications reveal shifting geopolitical priorities, domestic political pressures, and diplomatic strategies employed by both leaders. Below is a detailed chronological analysis of confirmed calls, their contexts, and outcomes, supported by documented evidence from primary sources.  

---

## April 21, 2019: Initial Congratulatory Call  
**Context**:  
Trump’s first confirmed communication with Zelenskyy occurred shortly after Zelenskyy’s electoral victory in Ukraine. The White House initially characterized the call as focusing on anti-corruption efforts and U.S. support for Ukrainian reforms[12][13]. However, the released memorandum revealed no substantive discussion of corruption[12]. Instead, Trump emphasized the U.S. economy’s strength under his administration and invited Zelenskyy to the White House, stating, “We’re with you all the way”[13].  

**Key Details**:  
- Zelenskyy expressed admiration for Trump’s leadership and invited him to attend his inauguration[13].  
- Trump declined but proposed a future White House meeting, which did not materialize until September 2019[13].  
- The call lasted 16 minutes and was later scrutinized for discrepancies between the White House’s public statement and the actual transcript[12].  

---

## July 25, 2019: The “Perfect” Call and Impeachment Catalyst  
**Context**:  
This call became central to Trump’s first impeachment. Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, leveraging $391 million in congressionally approved military aid and a White House meeting as bargaining chips[1][2][7][15].  

**Key Details**:  
- Trump explicitly requested investigations into the Bidens and the debunked CrowdStrike conspiracy theory, stating, “I would like you to do us a favor though”[7][10].  
- Ukrainian officials, including Zelenskyy’s adviser Serhiy Leshchenko, later acknowledged awareness of the precondition for the White House meeting[2][15].  
- The call transcript showed Trump directing Zelenskyy to collaborate with Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, despite Barr denying involvement[2][7].  
- A whistleblower complaint described White House officials as “visibly shaken” by the conversation, triggering impeachment proceedings[2][18].  

**Aftermath**:  
- The House of Representatives impeached Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in December 2019[9][15].  
- The Senate acquitted Trump in February 2020, with only one Republican senator voting to convict[9].  

---

## July 19, 2024: Post-Assassination Attempt Outreach  
**Context**:  
Following an assassination attempt on Trump during his 2024 campaign, Zelenskyy initiated a 15–20 minute call to express condolences and discuss Ukraine’s war with Russia[9].  

**Key Details**:  
- Trump framed the conversation as a commitment to “bring peace to the world” and end the war[9].  
- Zelenskyy emphasized gratitude for U.S. support and proposed in-person negotiations[9].  
- The call marked a tonal shift from their 2019 interactions, focusing on bilateral cooperation rather than political demands[9].  

---

## November 6, 2024: Post-Election Coordination  
**Context**:  
After Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Zelenskyy congratulated him and reaffirmed Ukraine’s reliance on U.S. leadership[11].  

**Key Details**:  
- Zelenskyy described the call as “excellent” and emphasized “strong bipartisan support” for Ukraine[11].  
- Trump reiterated his intent to broker peace but provided no concrete policy details[11].  
- The interaction avoided direct references to past tensions, instead focusing on future collaboration[11].  

---

## March 19, 2025: Ceasefire Negotiations and Infrastructure Attacks  
**Context**:  
Amid stalled peace talks and renewed Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke for approximately one hour to align strategies following Trump’s prior call with Vladimir Putin[16][19].  

**Key Details**:  
- Trump claimed Putin agreed to a 30-day pause on attacking energy targets, though Russia violated this within hours[16][19].  
- Zelenskyy requested additional air defense systems, to which Trump pledged to “find what was available”[16].  
- The call highlighted ongoing friction, with Trump advocating for U.S. management of Ukrainian power plants post-war as a security guarantee[19].  

---

### Analysis of Post-2021 Communications  
After Trump left office in January 2021, interactions shifted from transactional demands to pragmatic discussions about ending the Russo-Ukrainian War. The 2024–2025 calls reflect Zelenskyy’s adaptation to Trump’s renewed influence, balancing gratitude for military aid with resistance to concessions favoring Russia[4][6][8]. Notably, Trump’s rhetoric evolved from overt political pressure to brokering ceasefire proposals criticized as overly favorable to Moscow[5][8].

Here are the key points from the CNN article “Trump considers attending Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey” (May 13, 2025):

1. Trump’s openness to Turkey trip  
   • President Trump, on a tour of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, told reporters at the White House he might “detour to Turkey” for the planned Russia–Ukraine peace talks on Thursday “if I thought it would be helpful.”  
   • Quote (Trump): “I think you may have a good result… I don’t know where I’m going to be on Thursday…I was thinking about actually flying over there.”

2. Zelensky’s response  
   • Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine “would appreciate” Trump’s attendance and backed Trump’s suggestion of direct talks between Zelensky and Putin.  
   • Quote (Zelensky): “It is important that President Trump fully supports the meeting…we would like him to find the opportunity to be in Turkey.”

3. Putin’s proposed talks and ceasefire context  
   • Russian President Vladimir Putin recently proposed “direct talks” with Zelensky in Turkey—the first such offer since early 2022.  
   • Last weekend, “Ukraine’s major European allies” demanded Russia agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face “massive” new sanctions, insisting no talks could take place beforehand.  
   • Chancellor Friedrich Merz (Germany) said Trump had supported that European ceasefire initiative.  
   • Earlier in the week, Trump himself had called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, warning: “If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions.”

4. Shifts in Trump’s position  
   • By urging Zelensky to “immediately” accept Putin’s offer, Trump dropped his prior demand that Russia first agree to a ceasefire—marking a significant change in approach.

   • Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan “expressed full readiness to host the meeting” in Istanbul and told Putin the venue was available.  
   • Quote (Erdoğan): “A new window of opportunity has opened with the recent contacts. We hope that this opportunity will not be wasted.”

6. U.S. frustration with stalled peace efforts  
   • The Trump administration, per CNN, is growing frustrated that previous attempts to broker a Ukraine–Russia peace deal “have so far fallen short.”  
   • Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned: if there is no progress on Ukraine, the U.S. “will need to move on.”

  – They congratulated each other on Victory in Europe Day and reflected on how Allied cooperation laid the groundwork for peace and international law.  
  – Main topics: continued U.S. support for Ukraine, pressure on Russia, the frontline situation, diplomatic efforts, and achieving “a real and lasting ceasefire.”  
  – Zelensky said Ukraine is “ready for a full ceasefire starting right now,” and emphasized America’s role in securing peace.

• Broader military and diplomatic context  
  – Russia will name its representative for possible Istanbul peace talks once Putin “deems it necessary,” the Kremlin said.  
  – Presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak (May 13) stated Zelensky will meet no Russian official in Istanbul other than President Putin.  
  – During frontline reconnaissance, Ukrainian Special Operations Forces detected Buk-M3 and Uragan-1 systems on combat duty.

• Political-economic developments  
  – EU sanctions on Russia are set to expire end-July unless all 27 member states agree to extend them.  
  – Global trade upheavals continue to exacerbate Ukraine’s economic challenges stemming from Russia’s invasion.  
  – U.S. and European officials (May 12 talks, sources to Bloomberg) signaled that Washington wants Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations to begin before further tightening pressure on Moscow.

<Summary source="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-trump-peace-talks.html">
President Trump, in a Truth Social post on May 9, 2025, threatened “further sanctions” on Russia if it did not agree to a 30-day unconditional cease-fire in its war with Ukraine. He made the announcement after a late-Thursday phone call (May 8, the day Europe marks the end of World War II) with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, writing that “if the ceasefire is not respected, the U.S. and its partners will impose further sanctions.” This represented a notable shift by the Trump administration toward Ukraine’s position, following two months of policies seen as conciliatory to Moscow—including expanding diplomatic ties and voting against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia.

Key points from the article:

• Background on cease-fire proposals  
  – In March, at talks in Saudi Arabia, the administration had floated a 30-day truce for peace negotiations; Ukraine accepted, Russia insisted on negotiating terms first.  
  – After meeting Zelenskyy in Vatican City during Pope Francis’s funeral, Mr. Trump had already warned Russia against derailing talks.

• Immediate reactions  
  – President Zelenskyy welcomed Mr. Trump’s endorsement, posting on X that “Ukraine is ready for a full ceasefire starting right now.”  
  – Vice President J.D. Vance told Fox News that, should the U.S. withdraw from negotiations, “the blame could lie with Russia for not negotiating in good faith.”

• Combat and security developments  
  – Ukraine reported 193 engagements along its roughly 700-mile eastern front in the past 24 hours.  
  – In the run-up to Russia’s May 9 Victory Day parade, both sides launched exploding drones at each other’s capitals, briefly halting only during Russia’s proposed three-day truce, which Ukraine had rejected as too short.

• European and regional actions  
  – Foreign ministers from 15 European countries met in Lviv to announce plans for a tribunal to try Russian leaders—primarily targeting a few high-ranking officials—for the crime of aggression, though any prosecutions are likely years away.  
  – Ukraine’s domestic intelligence agency arrested members of an alleged Hungarian spy ring in western Ukraine, accused of gathering military-defense information around Zakarpattia.

• Russian symbolic move in occupied territory  
  – On Victory Day in Mariupol (occupied by Russian forces), authorities unveiled a bust of Joseph Stalin—reviled in Ukraine for the 1930s Holodomor famine—adorning it with red carnations and a commemorative plaque.

<Summary source="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/11/trump-putin-zelensky-ceasefire-talks/">
Below is a concise summary of Isobel Koshiw’s May 11, 2025 Washington Post article “Trump backs Putin’s proposal for Ukraine talks, undermining allies.”  

• Context and prior agreement  
  – On May 10, the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland joined President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in demanding that Russian President Vladimir Putin accept a 30-day ceasefire beginning Monday, or face increased sanctions.  

• Putin’s response and Trump’s reversal  
  – Putin then proposed direct talks with Ukraine to begin Thursday in Istanbul.  
  – On May 11, Trump posted on Truth Social: “Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY…At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible…” — explicitly siding with Putin’s call for talks before any ceasefire.  

• Zelenskyy and European leaders push back  
  – Moments after Trump’s post, Zelenskyy replied that Kyiv still expects a ceasefire first but is “ready to meet Putin on Thursday.”  
  – French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that “there can be no negotiations while weapons are speaking…A ceasefire is needed now, so that talks can begin.”  
  – German Chancellor Friedrich Merz similarly insisted that “we expect Moscow to now agree to a ceasefire…Talks cannot begin until the weapons fall silent.”  

• Reactions and wider implications  
  – Trump’s own envoy to Russia and Ukraine, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, appeared caught off-guard, still promoting the ceasefire-first approach on social media.  
  – Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said he had spoken with Putin and was ready to host talks, calling the moment a “historic turning point,” but he too emphasized that a ceasefire should precede negotiations.  
  – A meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin would be the first since Russia’s 2022 invasion, though Putin’s participation remains uncertain given his long-standing refusal to recognize Zelenskyy’s legitimacy.

Disclaimer: Extraction based solely on the provided New Republic article. No external sources were used.

Key facts and statistics
- Article date & author: March 19, 2025, Malcolm Ferguson, The New Republic.
- White House claim: During a call, Trump and Zelenskiy “discussed Ukraine’s electrical supply and nuclear power plants,” and Zelenskiy “welcoming American ownership of those plants,” per Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt (via CBS News’s Jennifer Jacobs).
- EU defense spending plan: over $800 billion by 2030.
- Canadian F-35 purchase under review: C$13.3 billion contract (2023) for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters.
- Historical U.S. share: Two-thirds of EU defense spending has gone to American contractors.
- NATO warning: Chief Mark Rutte urged Europe to adopt a “wartime mindset,” warning of a long-term confrontation with Russia and that Europe is “not ready…in four to five years.”

Reliable, named-source opinions
- Karoline Leavitt (U.S. White House press secretary): U.S. ownership of Ukrainian nuclear/electric plants “would be the best protection for that infrastructure.”
- Ursula von der Leyen (European Commission President, Politico): “We must buy more European. Because that means strengthening the European defense technological and industrial base.”
- Andrius Kubilius (European Defense Commissioner, Politico): Europe must consider “more global geopolitical developments and where Americans will put their strategic attention.”
- Gesine Weber (Paris-based fellow, German Marshall Fund, Politico): Trump’s NATO overhaul “makes the purchase of American arms systems no longer have any added value for Europeans.”
- Anonymous Western European defense official (Politico): “If you keep punching your allies in the face, eventually they’re going to stop wanting to buy weapons from you.”
- Mark Rutte (NATO Chief, quoted December 2024): Europe must “turbocharge” defense to prepare for a conflict with Russia in four to five years.

Potentially useful but less‐reliable or unnamed opinions
- Questions raised by the author: Why would Zelenskiy request U.S. ownership of critical infrastructure? What form would “American ownership” take—boots on the ground or other arrangements?
- Defense‐industry optimism (unnamed): U.S. arms makers hope “the looming threat of war” will drive continued foreign purchases despite political friction.
- Observations about Trump’s reliability: The article lists Trump’s past actions (hostility during peace negotiations, threats to annex Greenland, suspending Kyiv aid, proposing Canada as 51st state) as undermining confidence in U.S. commitments.
- Trump’s own comments on the Kennedy Center (first meeting as self-appointed chairman): 
  - Building “in tremendous disrepair,” plans to seek Congress funding to cover I-beams with marble or granite.
  - Criticized past hosts of Kennedy Center Honors, floated himself as host despite “not want[ing]…publicity.”
  - Suggested expanding honoree categories to include politicians, sports stars, and business figures (e.g., Luciano Pavarotti, Elvis Presley, Babe Ruth, Steve Wynn).

No comment was included from Trump directly on the Zelenskiy nuclear-plant ownership claim.

<Summary source="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/08/musk-trump-zelensky-ukraine-call">
Here’s a concise summary of the Axios scoop by Barak Ravid (Nov. 8, 2024):

• Call participants & timing  
  – On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump phoned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  
  – Unexpectedly, Elon Musk was also on the line.  
  – The call lasted about 25 minutes, per two sources with knowledge.  

• What was said  
  – Zelensky congratulated Trump on his victory; Trump said he would “support Ukraine” but gave no policy details.  
  – Musk told Zelensky he’d continue backing Ukraine via Starlink satellites.  

• Ukrainian reaction  
  – Three people briefed on Zelensky’s side said the call felt reassuring, “didn’t leave [him] with a feeling of despair,” and did not raise anxiety about Trump’s stance. (Unnamed sources)  
  – On X (formerly Twitter) Zelensky wrote: “I had an excellent call with President Trump … Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is vital for the world and for a just peace. … We agreed to maintain close dialogue.”  

• Broader context  
  – Throughout the campaign Trump promised a rapid end to the Russia-Ukraine war, declined to say which side he’d favor, and criticized U.S. aid packages—sparking alarm in Kyiv and Europe.  
  – The Biden team is rushing military assistance to Ukraine before Jan. 20, when Trump could halt it.  
  – Since September’s New York meeting (attended by former U.S. ambassador Richard Grenell), Zelensky’s advisers have kept “an open channel” with Trump’s aides. Trump told Zelensky they’d continue talks once his foreign-policy team is in place.  

• Caveats & next steps  
  – Axios sources say little substantive policy was discussed—no details on Trump’s “24-hour peace” plan or further U.S. aid.  
  – In a Budapest speech the next day, Zelensky stressed he still “cannot yet know what [Trump’s] actions will be,” warning that a “fast” peace could mean Ukrainian losses and reiterating Ukraine needs a “fair end” with security guarantees.  
  – Musk also joined a Trump call with Turkish President Erdoğan, reportedly while dining with Trump.  
  – Kyiv officials privately see some upside in breaking the “negative status quo,” but three sources expect Putin to derail any peace talks.  

Sources:  
– Two unnamed “sources with knowledge” on the call’s participants and duration  
– Three unnamed “sources briefed on [Zelensky’s] government assessments” on Ukrainian reactions and expectations  
– Zelensky’s public posts on X and his speech in Budapest  
– Musk (no direct comment)

**Zelensky says willing to meet Putin in Turkey - Yes Punjab News**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed willingness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Turkey to end the ongoing conflict between the two nations.

Zelensky stated, 'Here in Ukraine, we have absolutely no problem engaging in negotiations, we are ready for any format. I will be in Turkey this Thursday, May 15, and I expect Putin to come to Turkey as well. Personally. And I hope that this time, Putin won't be looking for excuses as to why he 'can't' make it.'

Putin stated, 'On this holy day for us, we declared a ceasefire for the third time. We told our colleagues in the West that we do not rule out the possibility of extending it. But, of course, this would have been done after we had analysed what happened over these three days, depending on how the Kyiv regime reacts to this.'

**Zelensky Rebuilds Relationship with Trump to Counter Putin**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reportedly re-established a positive relationship with former US President Donald Trump, following a 'very good and productive' phone call on March 18. This call was seen as a significant development, as it came after a tense meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the same day. Zelensky's conversation with Trump did not escalate into a confrontational tone, as it did during their last meeting on February 28. Instead, it appears that Zelensky has managed to establish a cooperative relationship with Trump, which may help to portray Ukraine and its leader in a more favorable light. Trump described the call as 'very good' on his Truth Social account, saying that both leaders are 'on the right track.' Zelensky also praised the call, calling it 'very good' and 'open,' and seemed to agree with Trump's statements, attempting to praise Trump and the leadership of the US.

**Zelensky Describes Call with Trump as 'Positive and Substantial'**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described his long phone call with US President Donald Trump on Wednesday as 'a positive, substantial, and very direct conversation'. This was the first known conversation between the two leaders since the controversy surrounding their meeting in Washington 19 days ago. The call came a day after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky expressed gratitude in a statement following the call, thanking Trump for 'a good and fruitful start to the work'. He did not comment on Trump's call with Putin without Russia's official agreement to a ceasefire. Zelensky said, 'We believe that with the cooperation of the US, with President Trump, and under American leadership, a lasting peace can be achieved this year.' However, he touched on one of the issues that has become a point of contention between Ukraine and the US, specifically stating that 'in later meetings, the two teams (US and Ukrainian) can agree on all necessary aspects to move towards a lasting peace and security guarantees.'

    – Factual vs. opinion: Chronology seems largely factual, but potential for mis-attribution or omission; treat cautiously.  

2. Reference class analysis  
  Candidate reference classes for probability of a call in a 4–5-week window:  
  a. Trump–Zelenskyy calls since Jan 2021:  March 19, May 8 => 2 calls in ~140 days ⇒ 1.8 calls/quarter ⇒ ~0.65 calls/month ⇒ Poisson λ≈0.65×1.1 months≈0.72 ⇒ P(call≥1)≈1–e^(−0.72)≈51%.  
  b. Trump–Zelenskyy calls in all time (2019–2025): 5 calls over ~2,200 days ⇒ ~0.08 calls/month ⇒ λ≈0.08×1.1≈0.09 ⇒ P≈9%.  
  c. Head-of-state calls during active negotiations in wartime (Biden–Zelenskyy analog): Biden reportedly calls Zelenskyy ~once/month ⇒ P≈1–e^(−1.1)≈67%.  
  Suitability: (a) reflects the most recent pattern under the Trump presidency, but may overstate frequency given exceptional circumstances around the May 8 call. (b) too conservative. (c) reflects U.S. institutional president patterns, not Trump’s idiosyncratic style.  
  Chosen reference class: (a) recent Trump–Zelenskyy cadence post–Jan 2025.

3. Timeframe analysis  
  – Forecast window: May 13 to June 15, 2025 = 33 days ≈1.1 months.  
  – Historical interval: March 19 → May 8 = 50 days ≈1.6 months between calls. Our window is shorter.  
  – Baseline λ from (a): 0.65 calls/month ⇒ expected calls in 1.1 months = 0.72 ⇒ P≥1 = 51%.  
  – Adjust for tempo: Last interval was 50 days; we have 33 days ⇒ scale λ down by 33/50 ⇒ 0.72×(33/50)=0.48 ⇒ P≃1–e^(−0.48)≈38%.

4. Justification  
  – Recent pattern of two substantive phone calls in early 2025 (March, May 8) indicates Trump and Zelenskyy remain in occasional direct contact, primarily around ceasefire proposals and U.S. assistance.  
  – The May 8 call itself was precipitated by a New York Times story on EU peace-plan diplomacy; a similar catalyst may arise (e.g., new Russian offensives, G7 meeting, EU sanctions review).  
  – Trump’s agenda as a sitting president (election campaign, domestic focus) may crowd out routine calls. Zelenskyy’s urgent war needs suggest he will request calls, but if Trump sees little immediate political benefit, he may delay.  
  – The 33-day window is shorter than the preceding 50-day interval, reducing probability.  
  – We rely on the recent calling rate (0.65/month) but adjust downward for the shorter window (33/50 ratio).  

Outside view calibration:  
- Base λ from recent pattern ⇒ λ₀ = 0.65 calls/month × (33/30) ≈ 0.72.  
- Adjust downward for unusual clustering in early 2025 (May 8 call may have “used up” the short-term momentum) by factor ~0.67 ⇒ λ_adj ≈0.48.  
- Probability of at least one call in window = 1 – exp(−λ_adj) ≈ 1 – e^(−0.48) ≈ 0.38 or 38%.

Outside View Prediction:  
I predict a 38% chance that Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will speak on the phone with each other between May 13, 2025 and June 15, 2025.

Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Wikipedia (2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting): High‐quality tertiary source summarizing a February 28, 2025 Oval Office meeting. Facts about participants, agenda, tone, aftermath. No direct phone‐call data in the window under question, but establishes Trump–Zelensky communications resumed in 2025.  
- AP News (“Trump and Zelenskyy through the years…”): Reputable, fact‐driven. Reviews their 2019 call that led to impeachment and later in-person meetings. Supplies background on how often U.S. leaders have spoken with Zelensky. Opinions are clearly attributed to Trump, Zelensky or polls.  
- CNN timeline (Sept 2019 whistleblower saga): Authoritative for 2019 events. No direct bearing on post-2021 calls, but shows Trump’s pattern of using phone calls for political leverage. Factual timeline.  
- New York Times (May 11, 2025): High‐quality report on cease-fire talks. Includes Trump’s Truth Social post but no call after May 11. Reliable for geopolitical context likely to drive future calls.  
- Washington Post (March 19, 2025): Excellent primary report of an hour-long Trump–Zelensky call. Both sides publicly acknowledge it. Factual.  
- Kyiv Independent (May 9, 2025): Specialist Ukraine outlet reporting Zelensky’s May 8 phone call with Trump. Reliable for identifying the most recent call.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
a. “Calls per president‐to‐Zelenskyy between Feb 2022–May 2025 under President Biden.”  
b. “Calls per president‐to‐Zelenskyy between Feb 2025–May 2025 under President Trump.”  
c. “Phone calls between heads of state in active war zones over a one-month window.”  

Class (b) is the tightest match: Trump’s own track record with Zelensky since Feb 28, 2025. Under this class, they’ve had exactly two acknowledged calls (March 19 and May 8) in the 76 days following the Oval Office meeting (≈1 call per 38 days).  

3. Timeframe analysis  
We need a forecast window of roughly 33 days (May 13–June 15). Historical frequency in class (b) suggests an expected call rate λ≈76 days/2 calls→38 days per call, or λ≈1/38 calls per day. Over 33 days, the Poisson probability of ≥1 call is 1 – e^(–33/38)=1 – e^(–0.868)≈0.58.  

4. Justification and adjustment  
- Base‐rate (inside Trump class): 58%.  
- Adjustments:  
  • Geopolitical catalysts: imminent Turkey-hosted “Istanbul talks” on Ukraine peace, plus EU leaders’ cease-fire push. Both sides have incentive to coordinate with Trump, and Zelensky has already signaled willingness to speak.  
  • Political incentives: Trump eager to position himself as peace-broker; Zelensky eager for U.S. engagement.  
  • Public acknowledgment requirement increases chance news breaks. Both leaders have publicly shared their recent calls, suggesting transparency.  

Taken together, these factors push us above the raw Poisson baseline. But given Trump’s unpredictability and competing events (e.g., other diplomatic channels), the probability does not approach certainty. A moderate upward adjustment to ~65% best captures the outside view.

Outside view calibration:
We start from the empirical rate (58%) derived from Trump’s two calls in 76 days. Factoring in fresh diplomatic momentum and political incentives, we raise to ~65%, reflecting that in 33 days there is a substantially better‐than‐even chance—but still meaningful uncertainty—that they will speak.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 65% probability that Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will speak on the phone with each other between May 13, 2025 and June 15, 2025.

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Wikipedia excerpt on the 28 Feb 2025 Oval Office meeting – Factual chronology of what happened in public; cites multiple news accounts.  Reliable for dates and the existence of unusual tension; editorial characterisations (“unprecedented”) are opinion-like.  
• AP News 1 Mar 2025 – Straight-news wire; high factual reliability for dates, quotations, poll numbers; minimal opinion.  
• CNN 20 Sep 2019 timeline – Well-sourced, largely factual reconstruction of the 2019 scandal; useful for historic call frequency and the precedent that both sides normally release read-outs.  
• NY Times 11 May 2025 – First-tier international outlet; provides new fact that Trump publicly urged Zelenskyy to accept direct talks and that cease-fire diplomacy is currently active.  Opinions (“reiterating his insistence…”) are clearly attributed to actors.  
• Washington Post 19 Mar 2025 – Mainstream U.S. newspaper; reports a confirmed 1-hour Trump–Zelenskyy phone call on 18 Mar and their mutual read-outs.  Solid for our “how often do they call?” statistic.  
• Kyiv Independent 9 May 2025 – Independent Ukrainian outlet; fact of a Trump–Zelenskyy phone call on 8 May comes from Zelenskyy’s nightly address—high primary-source value.  
• Perplexity report – Synthetic timeline pulling from many of the above; useful cross-check but second-order.  Factual statements already covered by primary articles.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes  
1.  “How often do U.S. Presidents and Ukrainian Presidents have phone calls while both are in office.”  
   – Data under Biden (Feb 2022–Jan 2025): ~22 publicly acknowledged calls ≈ 0.025/day.  
2.  “How often have Trump and Zelenskyy personally held calls, 2019–today.”  
   – 6 acknowledged calls over ~1,850 days ≈ 0.0032/day (but that average masks two distinct eras).  
3.  “How often have they called since Trump re-entered office (20 Jan 2025).”  
   – 2 calls (19 Mar, 8 May) in 108 days ⇒ 0.0185/day.  

Class 3 best fits: identical principals, current political context, similar incentive structure.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Question window: 13 May 2025 → 15 Jun 2025 = 33 days.  
Under a Poisson assumption with rate λ = 0.0185/day, expected calls in 33 days = 0.61.  
P(at least one) = 1 – e^(-0.61) ≈ 45%.  
Historical pattern nuance: spacing of the two 2025 calls is 50 days; if that periodicity held, next “scheduled” call would fall late Jun, just outside our window—this drags the naïve 45 % a bit lower.  Conversely, the Istanbul peace track (mid-May to early-Jun) raises diplomatic pressure, nudging the base rate upward.  Those inside-view cross-currents will be handled later, but for an outside view we note they roughly offset.

(d) Justification of outside view  
• Base data (class 3) gives ~45 %.  
• Our observation count is tiny (n=2), so rate estimate has large error bars; a conservative shrink toward the long-run Trump-Zelenskyy mean (class 2 gives 11 %) is prudent.  
   – Using a simple empirical Bayes with prior λ₀ = 0.0032/day (class 2) and weight equal to one pseudo-call in one year (365 days) we get posterior λ ≈ (2 + 1) / (108 + 365) = 0.0069/day ⇒ 0.23 expected calls in 33 days ⇒ P ≈ 21%.  
• But that shrinkage probably over-penalises because Trump and Zelenskyy were not both heads of state during 2021-24, so class 2 understates present incentives.  Averaging the two approaches (45 % and 21 %) gives ≈33%.

Hence, after balancing short-run evidence with a stability-of-statistics penalty, an outside-view estimate of one-third feels appropriate.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor1 (recent empirics) → 45 %  
Anchor2 (broader Trump-Zelenskyy history) → 21 %  
Mid-point, rounded to reflect uncertainty and to avoid false precision → 35 %  
Check: 35 % corresponds to 0.43 call expectation in 33 days (Poisson λ ≈0.013/day), comfortably between the two empirical anchors.

Outside View Prediction:
35 % probability that Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will speak by phone between 12 May 2025 and 15 Jun 2025.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **CNN Article (May 13, 2025)**: Credible source reporting Trump's consideration of attending Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey. The article quotes Trump directly about potentially "detouring to Turkey" for the planned peace talks on Thursday. Zelensky is quoted expressing desire for Trump's attendance.

2. **Kyiv Independent (May 9, 2025)**: Ukrainian news source confirming a phone call between Zelensky and Trump on May 8, 2025, described as "warm and constructive." Contains direct quotes from Zelensky's nightly address.

3. **New York Times (May 9, 2025)**: Reputable source reporting on Trump's Truth Social post following a May 8 phone call with Zelensky, where Trump threatened "further sanctions" on Russia if it did not agree to a ceasefire.

4. **Washington Post (May 11, 2025)**: Reputable source reporting Trump backing Putin's proposal for Ukraine talks, undermining the previous ceasefire-first stance agreed with allies.

5. **New Republic (March 19, 2025)**: Reports on an alleged discussion about Ukrainian nuclear plants during a Trump-Zelensky call. Lower factual certainty as it's reporting on claims made by White House Press Secretary.

6. **Axios (Nov 8, 2024)**: Reports on a post-election call between Trump, Zelensky, and Musk. Historical context, not directly relevant to current prediction window.

7. **AskNews Articles (May 10-12, 2025)**: Multiple sources confirming recent Trump-Zelensky communications and upcoming Turkey talks. Earlier articles document previous calls in February and March 2025. Cross-confirmation strengthens reliability of the May 8 call.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple independent, reliable sources (CNN, Kyiv Independent, NYT, others) confirm Trump and Zelensky spoke by phone on May 8, 2025, establishing a recent pattern of direct communication.
- High-stakes diplomatic situation with planned Turkey talks on May 15, 2025, creates strong structural incentives for continued communication.
- Trump has publicly expressed consideration of attending the talks, indicating active involvement that would likely require coordination with Zelensky.
- Zelensky has explicitly requested Trump's attendance, suggesting motivation to maintain direct communication.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Historical pattern shows multiple Trump-Zelensky phone calls in 2025 (February, March, May), indicating this is their established communication method during critical periods.
- Trump's diplomatic positioning (backing Putin's call for immediate talks) has created friction with European allies, potentially necessitating clarification with Zelensky.
- Turkish President Erdoğan is actively facilitating the talks, creating an institutional pathway that could prompt additional high-level communications.

**Weak Evidence:**
- No explicit mention in any source of a planned future call between Trump and Zelensky.
- Typical diplomatic protocol would suggest coordination calls before major diplomatic events.
- The volatility of the ceasefire situation might require ongoing communication.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is approximately 33 days (May 13 to June 15, 2025).

If the timeframe were halved (to May 29): My prediction would be higher, as the most critical period is the immediate lead-up to, during, and immediately after the planned Turkey talks on May 15. This period would capture the highest likelihood of communication.

If the timeframe were doubled (to July 18): The prediction would increase further, as it would encompass potential follow-up negotiations, implementation of any agreements, and additional developments requiring communication.

The most critical window appears to be the next 7-10 days surrounding the Turkey talks.

## (d) Justification

The strongest factors supporting a high probability:

1. **Established recent communication pattern**: Trump and Zelensky spoke by phone just 5 days ago (May 8), demonstrating active use of this communication channel.

2. **Imminent high-stakes diplomatic event**: The planned Turkey talks on May 15 (just 2 days away) create an immediate need for coordination, especially given Trump's indication he might attend.

3. **Trump's active involvement**: Trump has positioned himself centrally in the peace process, calling for Ukraine to "IMMEDIATELY" accept Putin's proposal for talks, indicating sustained engagement.

4. **Divergence from European allies**: Trump's backing of Putin's position (talks before ceasefire) contradicts his European allies' stance, potentially necessitating clarification with Zelensky.

5. **Practical coordination needs**: If Trump attends the Turkey talks as he's considering, logistical coordination with Zelensky would be necessary.

# Probability Calibration

Considering the very strong evidence of a recent phone call pattern, the imminent diplomatic event in Turkey, Trump's public statements about potential attendance, and the practical necessities of coordination, I assess a high probability of at least one phone call between Trump and Zelensky in the specified timeframe.

Factors that could prevent a call:
- Trump might decide against involvement in the peace process
- Communication could shift to intermediaries rather than direct calls
- The Turkey talks could be canceled if Putin refuses to attend
- Technical or scheduling issues might intervene

Even accounting for these possibilities, the evidence strongly supports a high likelihood of at least one phone call within the next month. The most critical period is the next week surrounding the Turkey talks, but even if a call doesn't occur during this window, the ongoing diplomatic situation would likely necessitate communication in the weeks that follow.

# Checklist:
1. Will Trump and Zelensky speak by phone between May 13-June 15, 2025, with both acknowledging the call occurred?
2. Outside view: Leaders engaged in active diplomacy typically maintain direct communication during crisis periods.
3. "87 out of 100 times, Trump and Zelensky would speak by phone within this 33-day period given the current diplomatic situation."
4. Key evidence: (1) Phone call on May 8 establishes recent pattern; (2) Turkey talks on May 15 create immediate coordination need; (3) Trump considering personal attendance; (4) Zelensky explicitly requesting Trump's involvement.
5. Blind spot: Turkey talks collapse before they begin, with Trump disengaging completely from peace process.
6. Status quo shows frequent Trump-Zelensky calls during critical diplomatic periods.

Probability: 87%
Predicted Probability: 87.0%

   - Expert opinions: Direct quotes from officials across multiple outlets

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Recent established pattern of calls** - Trump and Zelensky had a substantive call on May 8, 2025 (5 days ago), indicating an active communication channel. Prior reporting shows multiple calls in 2025 including one in March.
- **Active high-stakes diplomacy** - Peace talks scheduled for May 15 in Turkey with potential attendance by Trump, creating natural points for presidential coordination before and after.
- **Institutional necessity** - The U.S. remains Ukraine's critical military supporter requiring leader-level consultation on decisions regarding aid and diplomatic positions.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Trump's personal insertion into peace process** - Trump has publicly urged Ukraine to negotiate with Russia and is considering attending talks personally, suggesting his direct involvement requiring coordination.
- **Rapid diplomatic developments** - The situation is evolving quickly with Putin's offer, European leaders' response, and Trump's endorsement of talks creating need for alignment.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Very recent prior call** - Having just spoken on May 8, they may have covered key topics and won't need immediate follow-up.
- **Potential in-person meeting** - If Trump attends Turkey talks, they could meet in person rather than call.

## Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is 33 days (May 13 - June 15, 2025). This timeframe:
- Includes the critical May 15 Turkey talks and immediate aftermath
- Provides sufficient time for implementation discussions following any agreements
- Covers approximately one diplomatic cycle based on recent call pattern

If the timeframe were halved (16-17 days), I would reduce my probability to ~35% since it would only include the immediate period around the Turkey talks but miss potential follow-up developments.

If doubled (66 days), I would increase probability to ~75% as it would almost certainly include multiple diplomatic cycles and potential crises requiring consultation.

## Justification

The most compelling factors shifting my assessment from the outside view base rate (38%):

1. **Imminent high-stakes diplomacy** (+15%): The Turkey talks represent a critical juncture requiring coordination before and potentially after. Trump's possible attendance creates additional reasons for direct communication if he doesn't attend or a follow-up call if he does.

2. **Active U.S. policy involvement** (+10%): Trump has publicly inserted himself into negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, taking controversial positions that would necessitate alignment with Zelensky, especially as Trump has already undercut the European ceasefire-first approach.

3. **Institutional wartime relationship** (+5%): As leaders of allied nations during active conflict, frequent communication is expected, especially around major diplomatic initiatives and military decisions.

4. **Very recent prior call** (-10%): Having just spoken on May 8, they may have covered immediate needs, reducing necessity for another call very soon.

5. **Potential in-person meeting** (-5%): If Trump attends Turkey, they might meet directly rather than call in the immediate period.

These factors warrant a significant but not dramatic shift from the outside view baseline, as the fundamental communication pattern remains similar but current diplomatic activity increases likelihood.

Probability calibration:
Starting with the outside view base rate of 38%, the net adjustment from the factors above is +15%, resulting in 53%. This seems reasonable given the above analysis, but I'll make two final refinements:

1. Considering blind spots: Trump's unpredictability and potential for communication through intermediaries rather than direct calls.
2. Status quo check: Recent pattern suggests roughly monthly leader-level calls, which aligns with approximately one call in our 33-day window.

After these considerations, I'm adjusting slightly to 50%, reflecting even odds this occurs in the timeframe.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Zelensky have a phone conversation between May 13-June 15, 2025, as confirmed by credible sources?
2. Base rate: 38% chance from recent Trump-Zelensky call frequency adjusted for timeframe.
3. Consistency: In 50 of 100 similar situations, Trump and Zelensky would have at least one phone call in this 33-day period.
4. Key evidence: Recent May 8 call establishes pattern; Critical Turkey talks on May 15; Trump's active insertion into peace process; Institutional necessity of U.S.-Ukraine wartime communication.
5. Blind spot: Trump and Zelensky meet in person in Turkey instead of calling, or communicate primarily through advisors.
6. Status quo: Current pattern includes approximately monthly direct calls, making one call in 33 days aligned with status quo.

Probability: 50%
Predicted Probability: 50.0%

Output:
Analysis:
1. Paraphrase and time window  
   “Will Trump and Zelensky speak by phone between May 13, 2025 (exclusive) and June 15, 2025 (exclusive)?” We need a new call after their May 8 call, in roughly the next 32 days.

2. Outside-view base rate  
   Historical pattern: Trump–Zelensky calls on Feb 12, Mar 19, and May 8—a cadence of ~5–6 weeks. Many heads of state speak again within one–two months: rough base rate ~50–60% for a follow-up call within one month.

3. Source analysis  
   • CNN May 13 (strong, reliable): Trump mulls “detour” to Turkey for peace talks; Zelensky welcomes attendance. → Indicates coordination context.  
   • Kyiv Independent May 9 (reliable): Zelensky–Trump call on May 8. → Establishes last call was too early to count.  
   • NYTimes May 9 & WaPo May 11 (strong): Both confirm May 8 call, Trump’s shift to advocating talks before ceasefire, high-level engagement.  
   • AskNews batch (May 11–12, mixed quality): Numerous reports of Zelensky willing to meet Putin after Trump’s urging; demonstrates active Trump–Zelensky dialogue around peace talks.

4. Evidence analysis & weighing  
   Strong evidence  
     – Multiple reputable sources (NYT, WaPo, CNN) confirm active high-level engagement on Ukraine peace efforts.  
     – Structural factor: Both presidents have publicly cemented a positive rapport since February, suggesting sustained dialogue.  
   Moderate evidence  
     – Trump’s possible attendance in Turkey May 15 creates a direct need for coordination, likely via phone if schedules misalign.  
     – Established pattern of a call every ~6 weeks implies another call by mid-June.  
   Weak evidence  
     – Speculative AskNews chatter on generic willingness to meet for ceasefire; low marginal impact on phone-call timing.

5. Timeframe analysis  
   Prediction window ~32 days.  
   – If window halved (~16 days), probability drops: only the turkey-talks context would matter → perhaps ~40%.  
   – If doubled (~64 days), probability rises: historical cadence plus additional calls → ~80+%.

6. Key shifts from outside view  
   Outside-view base ~55%.  
   +15 points for strong, clear peace-talks coordination need in Turkey.  
   +5 points for established call cadence favoring mid-June follow-up.  
   –5 points for tight window (call on May 8 doesn’t count, only one clear event window).  
   = ~70%.

7. Justification  
   a. Active, amicable engagement on Ukraine by both leaders.  
   b. Imminent high-stakes peace conference in Istanbul around May 15 means calls to coordinate logistics.  
   c. Historical pattern of calls every ~5–6 weeks implies another call by early June.  
   d. Even if Trump attends in person, scheduling hiccups likely drive a phone call either side of the trip.

8. Blind-spot scenario  
   If Trump’s Turkey detour is canceled last minute and Zelensky stays home, the main driver for a call evaporates → might reduce odds by ~10%.

9. Status quo check  
   Relations remain positive and active; status quo favors continued phone diplomacy.

Probability calibration  
I estimate ~70% that Trump and Zelensky will speak by phone between now and June 15, 2025.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase matches resolution: new phone call after May 12, before June 15.
2. Base rate ~55% from similar world-leader cadences.
3. “70 out of 100 times, they will speak.”
4. Key evidence: Istanbul peace talks coordination; positive call history; May 8 call cadence; Trump’s public openness to direct diplomacy.
5. Blind spot: Turkey trip cancellation undermines call.
6. Status quo: sustained high-level dialogue drives calls.

Probability: 70%
Predicted Probability: 70.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Washington Post (May 11, 2025) “Trump backs Putin’s proposal…”  
   – High-quality primary reporting. Describes Trump’s reversal to back talks before ceasefire. No direct call after May 11, but signals Trump–Zelensky alignment.  
2. New York Times (May 9, 2025) “Trump threatened sanctions after late-Thursday phone call…”  
   – High-quality. Confirms May 8 call, both sides acknowledged. Provides context on tone and content.  
3. Kyiv Independent (May 9, 2025) “Zelensky, Trump discuss war…in phone call”  
   – Specialized Ukraine outlet; reliable factual report of the May 8 call.  
4. Wikipedia (Feb 2025 Trump–Zelensky Oval Office meeting)  
   – Tertiary summary. Establishes Feb 28 in-person meeting, resumption of personal contact.  
5. AP News timeline (2019)  
   – Authoritative back-story on prior calls leading to impeachment. Shows Trump’s pattern of high-stakes calls.  
6. CNN (May 13, 2025) “Trump considers attending Ukraine-Russia talks…”  
   – High-quality. Reports Trump’s willingness to visit Istanbul talks May 15, Zelensky welcomes it. Signals communication channels open.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical call frequency under Trump (Feb 28–May 8: 2 calls in 70 days) → implied Poisson rate λ≈1/35 days.  
• Both leaders publicly share calls; once called, widely reported → high transparency.  

Moderate evidence  
• Catalytic event: Istanbul peace talks on May 15. Trump is publicly considering attendance; Zelensky “would appreciate” his involvement. Direct line likely to be used.  
• Mutual incentives: Trump seeks peace-broker credentials; Zelensky seeks U.S. engagement and security assurances.  

Weak evidence  
• Trump’s domestic or Middle East tour schedule could crowd out Ukraine calls.  
• Risk of diplomatic missteps or third-party intermediaries supplanting direct calls.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 33 days (May 13–June 15).  
If window halved (~16 days): P=1–exp(−16/35)=35%.  
If window doubled (~66 days): P=1–exp(−66/35)=82%.  
Our 33-day window sits in between, suggesting a baseline 58% chance.  

(d) Justification and adjustment  
1. Outside-view base rate: 58% (from Poisson model pegged to 2 calls in 70 days).  
2. Upward adjustments: strong diplomatic momentum around Istanbul talks; Trump’s public signaling makes a follow-up call more likely.  
3. Downward adjustments: Trump’s unpredictability and possible competing priorities cap probability.  
Net adjustment: +7 points → Inside-view probability ≈65%.  

Reference-class note: Phone calls between heads of state during an active conflict region average one per 4–6 weeks; our base rate aligns with that. Current catalysts tilt it above even odds.

Probability calibration  
I predict a 65% chance they will speak on the phone between May 13 and June 15, 2025.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Between May 13 and June 15, 2025, will Trump and Zelensky speak by phone, both acknowledging the call?  
2. Base rate: 58% (2 calls in 70 days under Trump → Poisson P≥1 in 33 days).  
3. Consistency: “65 out of 100 times, the call happens.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Historical call frequency under Trump (Strong)  
   • Istanbul talks catalyst (Moderate)  
   • Mutual political incentives (Moderate)  
   • Public reporting transparency (Strong)  
5. Blind spot: A major diplomatic rift or scheduling conflict prevents any further calls; if that emerges, probability drops sharply.  
6. Status quo: Given steady communication since Feb 2025, calls will likely continue unless derailed.

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (quality & fact/opinion separation – *date in brackets*)  
1. CNN (13 May 2025) – First-tier US network; quotes Trump, Zelensky, Merz, Erdoğan.  Factual on statements/travel plans; commentary clearly attributed. High reliability.  
2. Kyiv Independent (9 May 2025) – Reputable Ukrainian outlet; primary source is Zelensky’s nightly address confirming 8 May call.  High factual value.  
3. NY Times (9 May 2025) – Paper of record; corroborates the 8 May call and policy shift.  High reliability.  
4. Washington Post (11 May 2025) – Major US daily; confirms Trump’s 11 May Truth-Social post; quotes Europeans.  High reliability.  
5. New Republic (19 Mar 2025) – Opinion-heavy; one factual nugget (White-House read-out of March call).  Moderate reliability for that single fact.  
6. Axios scoop (8 Nov 2024) – Reputable; two sources say Musk was on transition-period call.  Older but confirms openness to calls.  
7. Asknews compilation (Feb-May 2025) – Multiple wires/local outlets confirming 12 Feb, 19 Mar, 8 May calls and routine read-outs. Each item is small, but together they give a consistent factual pattern. Dates & quotes match mainstream press.  
→ Overall: multiple independent, named, high-tier sources confirm three calls in 2025 (12 Feb, 19 Mar, 8 May) and high-profile diplomacy aimed at mid-May Istanbul meeting.

(b) Evidence analysis (graded)  
Strong  
• Documented pattern of two calls in the last 50 days, acknowledged by both sides (Kyiv Independent, WaPo) → establishes current call frequency.  
• Looming 15 May Istanbul talks in which Trump may participate (CNN, WaPo), giving a clear diplomatic reason for pre- or post-talk coordination.  
Moderate  
• Both leaders publicly describe each other’s recent calls as “warm/constructive”, implying no interpersonal barrier.  
• February and March calls show that read-outs are routinely published – if a call happens, it is likely to be known and meet resolution criteria.  
Weak  
• Possibility of an in-person meeting in Istanbul could substitute for a phone call.  
• Media reports that US frustration is rising could, in principle, lead to a pause in direct leader-level engagement.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Window remaining: 33 days (13 May → 15 Jun 2025).  
Base-rate Poisson using 2025 data: 2 calls /108 days ⇒ λ≈0.0185 per day → P(call in next 33 d)=45 %.  
If the window were halved (16 days) probability would drop to ~27 %; doubled (66 days) it would climb to ~70 %, showing that most of the risk mass sits inside a one-to-two-month horizon.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
+8 %  Intensified diplomacy: possible Trump attendance at peace talks creates a concrete need for coordination within the next week.  
+4 %  Fresh precedent: only 5 days since last confirmed call; momentum suggests “rolling contact” during negotiations.  
–2 %  In-person Istanbul meeting might replace rather than complement a phone call.  
Total shift from outside-view 35 % → 45 %.

Key uncertainties: Trump’s travel plans (if he detours to Turkey), success/failure of cease-fire push, and whether staff-level channels obviate leader-level calls.

Probability calibration
My balanced estimate: a call will occur 45 % of the time under present conditions.  I judge a ±10 % swing plausible if (a) Trump definitively cancels Turkey trip (down) or (b) Putin confirms attendance, prompting last-minute US-Ukraine coordination (up).

Checklist:
1. Criteria: Trump & Zelensky phone call acknowledged by both, 13 May–15 Jun 2025.  
2. Outside view: 35 %.  
3. Consistency: “45 times in 100, the call happens.” Sounds reasonable.  
4. Top evidence: (i) two acknowledged calls in last 50 d; (ii) imminent Istanbul talks; (iii) positive tone in 8 May read-out; (iv) historic practice of public read-outs.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden breakdown in US-Ukraine relations (e.g., sanctions dispute) halts direct leader contact.  
6. Status-quo bias check: No-call is still slightly more likely; base-rate anchored forecast reflects that.

Probability: 45%
Predicted Probability: 45.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **CNN Article (May 13, 2025)**: Credible source reporting Trump's consideration of attending Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey. The article quotes Trump directly about potentially "detouring to Turkey" for the planned peace talks on Thursday. Zelensky is quoted expressing desire for Trump's attendance.

2. **Kyiv Independent (May 9, 2025)**: Ukrainian news source confirming a phone call between Zelensky and Trump on May 8, 2025, described as "warm and constructive." Contains direct quotes from Zelensky's nightly address.

3. **New York Times (May 9, 2025)**: Reputable source reporting on Trump's Truth Social post following a May 8 phone call with Zelensky, where Trump threatened "further sanctions" on Russia if it did not agree to a ceasefire.

4. **Washington Post (May 11, 2025)**: Reputable source reporting Trump backing Putin's proposal for Ukraine talks, undermining the previous ceasefire-first stance agreed with allies.

5. **New Republic (March 19, 2025)**: Reports on an alleged discussion about Ukrainian nuclear plants during a Trump-Zelensky call. Lower factual certainty as it's reporting on claims made by White House Press Secretary.

6. **Axios (Nov 8, 2024)**: Reports on a post-election call between Trump, Zelensky, and Musk. Historical context, not directly relevant to current prediction window.

7. **AskNews Articles (May 10-12, 2025)**: Multiple sources confirming recent Trump-Zelensky communications and upcoming Turkey talks. Earlier articles document previous calls in February and March 2025. Cross-confirmation strengthens reliability of the May 8 call.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple independent, reliable sources (CNN, Kyiv Independent, NYT, others) confirm Trump and Zelensky spoke by phone on May 8, 2025, establishing a recent pattern of direct communication.
- High-stakes diplomatic situation with planned Turkey talks on May 15, 2025, creates strong structural incentives for continued communication.
- Trump has publicly expressed consideration of attending the talks, indicating active involvement that would likely require coordination with Zelensky.
- Zelensky has explicitly requested Trump's attendance, suggesting motivation to maintain direct communication.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Historical pattern shows multiple Trump-Zelensky phone calls in 2025 (February, March, May), indicating this is their established communication method during critical periods.
- Trump's diplomatic positioning (backing Putin's call for immediate talks) has created friction with European allies, potentially necessitating clarification with Zelensky.
- Turkish President Erdoğan is actively facilitating the talks, creating an institutional pathway that could prompt additional high-level communications.

**Weak Evidence:**
- No explicit mention in any source of a planned future call between Trump and Zelensky.
- Typical diplomatic protocol would suggest coordination calls before major diplomatic events.
- The volatility of the ceasefire situation might require ongoing communication.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is approximately 33 days (May 13 to June 15, 2025).

If the timeframe were halved (to May 29): My prediction would be higher, as the most critical period is the immediate lead-up to, during, and immediately after the planned Turkey talks on May 15. This period would capture the highest likelihood of communication.

If the timeframe were doubled (to July 18): The prediction would increase further, as it would encompass potential follow-up negotiations, implementation of any agreements, and additional developments requiring communication.

The most critical window appears to be the next 7-10 days surrounding the Turkey talks.

## (d) Justification

The strongest factors supporting a high probability:

1. **Established recent communication pattern**: Trump and Zelensky spoke by phone just 5 days ago (May 8), demonstrating active use of this communication channel.

2. **Imminent high-stakes diplomatic event**: The planned Turkey talks on May 15 (just 2 days away) create an immediate need for coordination, especially given Trump's indication he might attend.

3. **Trump's active involvement**: Trump has positioned himself centrally in the peace process, calling for Ukraine to "IMMEDIATELY" accept Putin's proposal for talks, indicating sustained engagement.

4. **Divergence from European allies**: Trump's backing of Putin's position (talks before ceasefire) contradicts his European allies' stance, potentially necessitating clarification with Zelensky.

5. **Practical coordination needs**: If Trump attends the Turkey talks as he's considering, logistical coordination with Zelensky would be necessary.

# Probability Calibration

Considering the very strong evidence of a recent phone call pattern, the imminent diplomatic event in Turkey, Trump's public statements about potential attendance, and the practical necessities of coordination, I assess a high probability of at least one phone call between Trump and Zelensky in the specified timeframe.

Factors that could prevent a call:
- Trump might decide against involvement in the peace process
- Communication could shift to intermediaries rather than direct calls
- The Turkey talks could be canceled if Putin refuses to attend
- Technical or scheduling issues might intervene

Even accounting for these possibilities, the evidence strongly supports a high likelihood of at least one phone call within the next month. The most critical period is the next week surrounding the Turkey talks, but even if a call doesn't occur during this window, the ongoing diplomatic situation would likely necessitate communication in the weeks that follow.

# Checklist:
1. Will Trump and Zelensky speak by phone between May 13-June 15, 2025, with both acknowledging the call occurred?
2. Outside view: Leaders engaged in active diplomacy typically maintain direct communication during crisis periods.
3. "87 out of 100 times, Trump and Zelensky would speak by phone within this 33-day period given the current diplomatic situation."
4. Key evidence: (1) Phone call on May 8 establishes recent pattern; (2) Turkey talks on May 15 create immediate coordination need; (3) Trump considering personal attendance; (4) Zelensky explicitly requesting Trump's involvement.
5. Blind spot: Turkey talks collapse before they begin, with Trump disengaging completely from peace process.
6. Status quo shows frequent Trump-Zelensky calls during critical diplomatic periods.

Probability: 87%
Predicted Probability: 87.0%

   - Expert opinions: Direct quotes from officials across multiple outlets

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Recent established pattern of calls** - Trump and Zelensky had a substantive call on May 8, 2025 (5 days ago), indicating an active communication channel. Prior reporting shows multiple calls in 2025 including one in March.
- **Active high-stakes diplomacy** - Peace talks scheduled for May 15 in Turkey with potential attendance by Trump, creating natural points for presidential coordination before and after.
- **Institutional necessity** - The U.S. remains Ukraine's critical military supporter requiring leader-level consultation on decisions regarding aid and diplomatic positions.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Trump's personal insertion into peace process** - Trump has publicly urged Ukraine to negotiate with Russia and is considering attending talks personally, suggesting his direct involvement requiring coordination.
- **Rapid diplomatic developments** - The situation is evolving quickly with Putin's offer, European leaders' response, and Trump's endorsement of talks creating need for alignment.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Very recent prior call** - Having just spoken on May 8, they may have covered key topics and won't need immediate follow-up.
- **Potential in-person meeting** - If Trump attends Turkey talks, they could meet in person rather than call.

## Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is 33 days (May 13 - June 15, 2025). This timeframe:
- Includes the critical May 15 Turkey talks and immediate aftermath
- Provides sufficient time for implementation discussions following any agreements
- Covers approximately one diplomatic cycle based on recent call pattern

If the timeframe were halved (16-17 days), I would reduce my probability to ~35% since it would only include the immediate period around the Turkey talks but miss potential follow-up developments.

If doubled (66 days), I would increase probability to ~75% as it would almost certainly include multiple diplomatic cycles and potential crises requiring consultation.

## Justification

The most compelling factors shifting my assessment from the outside view base rate (38%):

1. **Imminent high-stakes diplomacy** (+15%): The Turkey talks represent a critical juncture requiring coordination before and potentially after. Trump's possible attendance creates additional reasons for direct communication if he doesn't attend or a follow-up call if he does.

2. **Active U.S. policy involvement** (+10%): Trump has publicly inserted himself into negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, taking controversial positions that would necessitate alignment with Zelensky, especially as Trump has already undercut the European ceasefire-first approach.

3. **Institutional wartime relationship** (+5%): As leaders of allied nations during active conflict, frequent communication is expected, especially around major diplomatic initiatives and military decisions.

4. **Very recent prior call** (-10%): Having just spoken on May 8, they may have covered immediate needs, reducing necessity for another call very soon.

5. **Potential in-person meeting** (-5%): If Trump attends Turkey, they might meet directly rather than call in the immediate period.

These factors warrant a significant but not dramatic shift from the outside view baseline, as the fundamental communication pattern remains similar but current diplomatic activity increases likelihood.

Probability calibration:
Starting with the outside view base rate of 38%, the net adjustment from the factors above is +15%, resulting in 53%. This seems reasonable given the above analysis, but I'll make two final refinements:

1. Considering blind spots: Trump's unpredictability and potential for communication through intermediaries rather than direct calls.
2. Status quo check: Recent pattern suggests roughly monthly leader-level calls, which aligns with approximately one call in our 33-day window.

After these considerations, I'm adjusting slightly to 50%, reflecting even odds this occurs in the timeframe.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Trump and Zelensky have a phone conversation between May 13-June 15, 2025, as confirmed by credible sources?
2. Base rate: 38% chance from recent Trump-Zelensky call frequency adjusted for timeframe.
3. Consistency: In 50 of 100 similar situations, Trump and Zelensky would have at least one phone call in this 33-day period.
4. Key evidence: Recent May 8 call establishes pattern; Critical Turkey talks on May 15; Trump's active insertion into peace process; Institutional necessity of U.S.-Ukraine wartime communication.
5. Blind spot: Trump and Zelensky meet in person in Turkey instead of calling, or communicate primarily through advisors.
6. Status quo: Current pattern includes approximately monthly direct calls, making one call in 33 days aligned with status quo.

2. Outside-view base rate  
   Historical pattern: Trump–Zelensky calls on Feb 12, Mar 19, and May 8—a cadence of ~5–6 weeks. Many heads of state speak again within one–two months: rough base rate ~50–60% for a follow-up call within one month.

   • CNN May 13 (strong, reliable): Trump mulls “detour” to Turkey for peace talks; Zelensky welcomes attendance. → Indicates coordination context.  
   • Kyiv Independent May 9 (reliable): Zelensky–Trump call on May 8. → Establishes last call was too early to count.  
   • NYTimes May 9 & WaPo May 11 (strong): Both confirm May 8 call, Trump’s shift to advocating talks before ceasefire, high-level engagement.  
   • AskNews batch (May 11–12, mixed quality): Numerous reports of Zelensky willing to meet Putin after Trump’s urging; demonstrates active Trump–Zelensky dialogue around peace talks.

4. Evidence analysis & weighing  
   Strong evidence  
     – Multiple reputable sources (NYT, WaPo, CNN) confirm active high-level engagement on Ukraine peace efforts.  
     – Structural factor: Both presidents have publicly cemented a positive rapport since February, suggesting sustained dialogue.  
   Moderate evidence  
     – Trump’s possible attendance in Turkey May 15 creates a direct need for coordination, likely via phone if schedules misalign.  
     – Established pattern of a call every ~6 weeks implies another call by mid-June.  
   Weak evidence  
     – Speculative AskNews chatter on generic willingness to meet for ceasefire; low marginal impact on phone-call timing.

5. Timeframe analysis  
   Prediction window ~32 days.  
   – If window halved (~16 days), probability drops: only the turkey-talks context would matter → perhaps ~40%.  
   – If doubled (~64 days), probability rises: historical cadence plus additional calls → ~80+%.

6. Key shifts from outside view  
   Outside-view base ~55%.  
   +15 points for strong, clear peace-talks coordination need in Turkey.  
   +5 points for established call cadence favoring mid-June follow-up.  
   –5 points for tight window (call on May 8 doesn’t count, only one clear event window).  
   = ~70%.

7. Justification  
   a. Active, amicable engagement on Ukraine by both leaders.  
   b. Imminent high-stakes peace conference in Istanbul around May 15 means calls to coordinate logistics.  
   c. Historical pattern of calls every ~5–6 weeks implies another call by early June.  
   d. Even if Trump attends in person, scheduling hiccups likely drive a phone call either side of the trip.

8. Blind-spot scenario  
   If Trump’s Turkey detour is canceled last minute and Zelensky stays home, the main driver for a call evaporates → might reduce odds by ~10%.

9. Status quo check  
   Relations remain positive and active; status quo favors continued phone diplomacy.

Probability calibration  
I estimate ~70% that Trump and Zelensky will speak by phone between now and June 15, 2025.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase matches resolution: new phone call after May 12, before June 15.
2. Base rate ~55% from similar world-leader cadences.
3. “70 out of 100 times, they will speak.”
4. Key evidence: Istanbul peace talks coordination; positive call history; May 8 call cadence; Trump’s public openness to direct diplomacy.
5. Blind spot: Turkey trip cancellation undermines call.
6. Status quo: sustained high-level dialogue drives calls.

Probability: 70%
Predicted Probability: 70.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Washington Post (May 11, 2025) “Trump backs Putin’s proposal…”  
   – High-quality primary reporting. Describes Trump’s reversal to back talks before ceasefire. No direct call after May 11, but signals Trump–Zelensky alignment.  
2. New York Times (May 9, 2025) “Trump threatened sanctions after late-Thursday phone call…”  
   – High-quality. Confirms May 8 call, both sides acknowledged. Provides context on tone and content.  
3. Kyiv Independent (May 9, 2025) “Zelensky, Trump discuss war…in phone call”  
   – Specialized Ukraine outlet; reliable factual report of the May 8 call.  
4. Wikipedia (Feb 2025 Trump–Zelensky Oval Office meeting)  
   – Tertiary summary. Establishes Feb 28 in-person meeting, resumption of personal contact.  
5. AP News timeline (2019)  
   – Authoritative back-story on prior calls leading to impeachment. Shows Trump’s pattern of high-stakes calls.  
6. CNN (May 13, 2025) “Trump considers attending Ukraine-Russia talks…”  
   – High-quality. Reports Trump’s willingness to visit Istanbul talks May 15, Zelensky welcomes it. Signals communication channels open.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical call frequency under Trump (Feb 28–May 8: 2 calls in 70 days) → implied Poisson rate λ≈1/35 days.  
• Both leaders publicly share calls; once called, widely reported → high transparency.  

Moderate evidence  
• Catalytic event: Istanbul peace talks on May 15. Trump is publicly considering attendance; Zelensky “would appreciate” his involvement. Direct line likely to be used.  
• Mutual incentives: Trump seeks peace-broker credentials; Zelensky seeks U.S. engagement and security assurances.  

Weak evidence  
• Trump’s domestic or Middle East tour schedule could crowd out Ukraine calls.  
• Risk of diplomatic missteps or third-party intermediaries supplanting direct calls.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 33 days (May 13–June 15).  
If window halved (~16 days): P=1–exp(−16/35)=35%.  
If window doubled (~66 days): P=1–exp(−66/35)=82%.  
Our 33-day window sits in between, suggesting a baseline 58% chance.  

(d) Justification and adjustment  
1. Outside-view base rate: 58% (from Poisson model pegged to 2 calls in 70 days).  
2. Upward adjustments: strong diplomatic momentum around Istanbul talks; Trump’s public signaling makes a follow-up call more likely.  
3. Downward adjustments: Trump’s unpredictability and possible competing priorities cap probability.  
Net adjustment: +7 points → Inside-view probability ≈65%.  

Reference-class note: Phone calls between heads of state during an active conflict region average one per 4–6 weeks; our base rate aligns with that. Current catalysts tilt it above even odds.

Probability calibration  
I predict a 65% chance they will speak on the phone between May 13 and June 15, 2025.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Between May 13 and June 15, 2025, will Trump and Zelensky speak by phone, both acknowledging the call?  
2. Base rate: 58% (2 calls in 70 days under Trump → Poisson P≥1 in 33 days).  
3. Consistency: “65 out of 100 times, the call happens.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Historical call frequency under Trump (Strong)  
   • Istanbul talks catalyst (Moderate)  
   • Mutual political incentives (Moderate)  
   • Public reporting transparency (Strong)  
5. Blind spot: A major diplomatic rift or scheduling conflict prevents any further calls; if that emerges, probability drops sharply.  
6. Status quo: Given steady communication since Feb 2025, calls will likely continue unless derailed.

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (quality & fact/opinion separation – *date in brackets*)  
1. CNN (13 May 2025) – First-tier US network; quotes Trump, Zelensky, Merz, Erdoğan.  Factual on statements/travel plans; commentary clearly attributed. High reliability.  
2. Kyiv Independent (9 May 2025) – Reputable Ukrainian outlet; primary source is Zelensky’s nightly address confirming 8 May call.  High factual value.  
3. NY Times (9 May 2025) – Paper of record; corroborates the 8 May call and policy shift.  High reliability.  
4. Washington Post (11 May 2025) – Major US daily; confirms Trump’s 11 May Truth-Social post; quotes Europeans.  High reliability.  
5. New Republic (19 Mar 2025) – Opinion-heavy; one factual nugget (White-House read-out of March call).  Moderate reliability for that single fact.  
6. Axios scoop (8 Nov 2024) – Reputable; two sources say Musk was on transition-period call.  Older but confirms openness to calls.  
7. Asknews compilation (Feb-May 2025) – Multiple wires/local outlets confirming 12 Feb, 19 Mar, 8 May calls and routine read-outs. Each item is small, but together they give a consistent factual pattern. Dates & quotes match mainstream press.  
→ Overall: multiple independent, named, high-tier sources confirm three calls in 2025 (12 Feb, 19 Mar, 8 May) and high-profile diplomacy aimed at mid-May Istanbul meeting.

(b) Evidence analysis (graded)  
Strong  
• Documented pattern of two calls in the last 50 days, acknowledged by both sides (Kyiv Independent, WaPo) → establishes current call frequency.  
• Looming 15 May Istanbul talks in which Trump may participate (CNN, WaPo), giving a clear diplomatic reason for pre- or post-talk coordination.  
Moderate  
• Both leaders publicly describe each other’s recent calls as “warm/constructive”, implying no interpersonal barrier.  
• February and March calls show that read-outs are routinely published – if a call happens, it is likely to be known and meet resolution criteria.  
Weak  
• Possibility of an in-person meeting in Istanbul could substitute for a phone call.  
• Media reports that US frustration is rising could, in principle, lead to a pause in direct leader-level engagement.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Window remaining: 33 days (13 May → 15 Jun 2025).  
Base-rate Poisson using 2025 data: 2 calls /108 days ⇒ λ≈0.0185 per day → P(call in next 33 d)=45 %.  
If the window were halved (16 days) probability would drop to ~27 %; doubled (66 days) it would climb to ~70 %, showing that most of the risk mass sits inside a one-to-two-month horizon.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
+8 %  Intensified diplomacy: possible Trump attendance at peace talks creates a concrete need for coordination within the next week.  
+4 %  Fresh precedent: only 5 days since last confirmed call; momentum suggests “rolling contact” during negotiations.  
–2 %  In-person Istanbul meeting might replace rather than complement a phone call.  
Total shift from outside-view 35 % → 45 %.

Key uncertainties: Trump’s travel plans (if he detours to Turkey), success/failure of cease-fire push, and whether staff-level channels obviate leader-level calls.

Probability calibration
My balanced estimate: a call will occur 45 % of the time under present conditions.  I judge a ±10 % swing plausible if (a) Trump definitively cancels Turkey trip (down) or (b) Putin confirms attendance, prompting last-minute US-Ukraine coordination (up).

Checklist:
1. Criteria: Trump & Zelensky phone call acknowledged by both, 13 May–15 Jun 2025.  
2. Outside view: 35 %.  
3. Consistency: “45 times in 100, the call happens.” Sounds reasonable.  
4. Top evidence: (i) two acknowledged calls in last 50 d; (ii) imminent Istanbul talks; (iii) positive tone in 8 May read-out; (iv) historic practice of public read-outs.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden breakdown in US-Ukraine relations (e.g., sanctions dispute) halts direct leader contact.  
6. Status-quo bias check: No-call is still slightly more likely; base-rate anchored forecast reflects that.

Probability: 45%
Predicted Probability: 45.0%...
