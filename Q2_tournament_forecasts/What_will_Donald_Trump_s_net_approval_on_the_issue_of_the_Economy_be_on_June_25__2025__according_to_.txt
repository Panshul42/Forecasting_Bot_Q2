Analysis:
We need a clear outside‐view on Trump’s net approval on the economy as captured in Nate Silver’s “Silver Bulletin” tracker—specifically the historical trajectory of that metric through his presidency and afterward. Historically, Silver has reported Trump’s net‐economy approval roughly weekly or biweekly since early 2017. Those data typically show net approval fluctuating from strongly positive early on (peaking in the +20s to +30s) down to slight positives or even small negatives toward the end of his term, then stabilizing in low‐single digits post‐2021. To forecast June 25, 2025, we’ll want:  
‐ The range of net‐economy approval values over similar calendar periods (late June of previous years).  
‐ Trends around mid‐year inflection points (e.g., summer 2019–2020).  
‐ Any post‐presidency shifts in issue‐specific ratings vs. overall job approval.  

Armed with those historical benchmarks, we can form a base‐rate (out‐view) and then adjust for current economic indicators, campaign events, and media coverage to generate an inside view.

Analysis:
We need to forecast Trump’s net economy approval on June 25, 2025, as tracked by the Silver Bulletin. First, establish a base rate using historical approval trajectories for incumbent and former presidents on economic issues at similar calendar points. Next, gather inside-view data: the latest Silver Bulletin update if available, recent proprietary polls on Trump’s economy approval, macro indicators (inflation, unemployment, consumer sentiment), major policy announcements (tax plans, trade deals, stimulus), and news events (Recession fears, Fed rate changes, geopolitical shocks). We will also note expert commentary and market signals. This information will let us adjust the base rate to account for current momentum—whether improving job numbers or rising prices are likely to boost or drag down Trump’s net approval.

<Summary source="https://www.natesilver.net/p/how-low-is-trumps-popularity-floor">
Here are the key takeaways from Nate Silver’s “How low is Trump’s popularity floor?” (March 21):

Facts & statistics  
• Net approval start vs. two months in:  
  – Jan 21 opening net approval: +11.6  
  – March 21 net approval: –2.2  
  – Decline of 13.8 points over 60 days (~7 points/month)  
• Crude linear extrapolation (not a prediction): –27.6 by July 21; –51.2 by Nov 21  
• First-term daily approval (final averages):  
  – Trump 1.0: 41.7%  
  – 95th-percentile daily range: floor 37.8%, ceiling 45.0%  
• Second-term (lame-duck) patterns among presidents re-elected since Truman:  
  – First-term average approval: 58.0%, floor 47.1%  
  – Second-term average: 48.0%, floor 37.7%  

Comparisons & context  
• Early-term decline is typical: Trump’s drop from Feb 1–Mar 21 is only slightly worse than the average of the past five presidents in their first 60 days.  
• Undecided voters often shift into disapproval early in a presidency; Trump has also lost some initial supporters.  

Analysis & theories (Silver’s opinions)  
• Known-commodity effect: Trump’s base is passionate and insulated, suggesting a relatively high “floor.”  
• Lame-duck effect: second terms tend to see both lower averages and lower floors—precedents include Johnson, Nixon, and G.W. Bush.  
• “Last In, First Out” (LIFO) hypothesis: the most recent Trump supporters may be the first to abandon him. Potentially vulnerable groups:  
  1. Young voters (less partisan, socially influenced)  
  2. Minority voters—Hispanic, Asian American, Black men (all shifted toward Trump in 2024; loyalty may be fragile)  
  3. “Riverian” elites (Silicon Valley/Wall Street quantitative types)—small in number but influential through finance and media; may defect once a cascade begins  

Silver cautions that these are plausible scenarios, not firm predictions, and that approval-rating trajectories rarely follow straight lines.

<Summary source="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-reelection-may-hinge-on-the-economy-and-coronavirus/">
Here’s a concise summary of Nate Silver’s March 25, 2020 FiveThirtyEight article “Trump’s Reelection May Hinge On The Economy — And Coronavirus”:

• Context & Concern  
  – Trump’s approval rating saw a modest uplift early in the COVID-19 crisis (“rally-around-the-flag” effect).  
  – A deep recession triggered by the pandemic could jeopardize his reelection prospects.  

• Limits of “Magic-Bullet” Economic Models  
  – Only 18 post-WWII elections → small sample size; overfitting and p-hacking are major risks.  
  – Single-variable models (e.g., focusing solely on Q2 GDP) typically underperform out of sample.  

• FiveThirtyEight’s Economic Index Approach  
  – Combines multiple broad economic indicators (GDP, employment, income, etc.).  
  – Averages changes over various time frames rather than fixating on one quarter.  
  – Designed to avoid cherry-picking variables that merely fit past data.  

• Historical Correlation (Incumbent-Party Performance vs. Economy)  
  – Worst economic years as of Election Day: 1980, 2008 → steep incumbent losses; 1992 → incumbent loss.  
  – Best years: 1984, 1972 → landslides; 1968 → narrow incumbent loss.  

• Four Model Variants  
  1. All presidents, economic index only  
  2. Elected incumbents only, economic index only  
  3. All presidents, economic index + presidential approval  
  4. Elected incumbents only, economic index + approval  
  – Models 2 & 4 (incumbents only) are more sensitive to economic swings.  
  – Models 3 & 4 (including approval) show muted economy-effect since approval captures other popularity factors.  

• Scenario Projections (Popular-Vote Margin for Trump)  
  – Mild recession (akin to 1992): loss of 4.0 to 5.7 percentage points across models.  
  – Severe recession (akin to 2008): loss of 9.1 to 14.6 points.  

• Caveats & Next Steps  
  – Unclear whether business-cycle-based models fully apply amid a pandemic.  
  – FiveThirtyEight’s final 2020 forecast may blend economic-index priors with non-economic priors.

<Summary source="https://www.newsweek.com/nate-silver-donald-trump-approval-rating-rebound-2074202">
Here’s a concise summary of the Newsweek article by Hugh Cameron (May 19, 2025) on Nate Silver’s latest approval‐rating data:

Facts & figures from Silver Bulletin (mid-May aggregate)  
• Overall net approval: –5.8 (up from a second-term low of –9.7 on April 29; highest since April 22)

• By issue:  
  – Immigration: +1.4 percent (48.7 approve vs. 47.3 disapprove)  
  – Trade: –11.9 percent  
  – Economy: –13 percent  
  – Inflation: –26 percent  

Contextual data  
• Trump began second term in January with a net approval of +11.7 percent per Silver  
• Bureau of Labor Statistics: 12-month CPI inflation slowed to 2.3 percent (lowest since Feb 2021)

Named opinions  
• Eli McKown-Dawson (Silver Bulletin): “This could just be noise driven by a dearth of new polls, or it could be a reversal of the downward trend… We’ll have to wait for more data.”  
• Rebecca Homkes (London Business School): cautioning that “media shouldn’t get distracted by the posturing… chaos has a cost,” urging focus on negotiating longer-term tariff agreements  
• Sean Metcalfe (Oxford Economics): warns a “future escalation” remains possible, keeping trade-policy uncertainty high and risking further supply-chain disruptions

**US Economy Faces Difficult Week Amid Trump's Trade Policies and Tax Reform**
The US economy is facing a difficult week as President Donald Trump's erratic trade policies and 'great and beautiful' tax reform continue to cause uncertainty. The new data to be released this week will give Wall Street and the Federal Reserve a better idea of the consequences of Trump's policies, including two new consumer studies, a revised estimate of economic growth in the first quarter, and updated consumer spending data. Analysts will also get clues on what this could mean for the Fed, as several of its officials are scheduled to make public statements throughout the week. The recent data has shown that consumer confidence has fallen, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropping 7.9 points in April to 86, the lowest level since May 2020. Economists expect a slight improvement in consumer confidence in May. The University of Michigan will also release a revised version of its consumer sentiment survey, which showed a preliminary reading of a significant decline in consumer sentiment. The Commerce Department will release its second estimate of GDP for the first quarter, which showed a 0.3% annualized decline, the worst quarter since 2022. The department will also release updated data on consumer spending, income, and inflation, which is preferred by the Fed. The high interest rates, economic concerns, and volatility in financial markets are clouding the prospects of the US housing market. The new data this week will show if buyers will be further pressured. The National Association of Realtors will report on home sales based on contracts signed in April, which showed a 6.1% increase in pending sales in March. Freddie Mac will also release the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which has been increasing due to concerns about the impact of Trump's tax plan on national debt.

**Trump's approval ratings, down in April, bounced back in May**
President Trump's approval ratings have been improving after a low point in April. According to recent polls from the Daily Mail, Rasmussen, and Morning Consult, Trump's approval rating is currently at 48-50%, with 49-50% disapproving. This is a significant improvement from the end of April, when his approval rating was at a net negative 7 points. The improvement is attributed to Trump's recent foreign trip and progress in trade talks with China, as well as the passing of the 'big, beautiful bill' with associated tax cuts. However, Trump remains deeply underwater on issues such as inflation, with 66% of Americans disapproving of his handling of the issue. Despite this, Trump's approval on the economy has improved to a net negative 11 points, with 42% approving and 53% disapproving. As Douglas E. Schoen and Carly Cooperman note, Trump's approval is largely due to his own efforts, particularly when he is seen as an effective dealmaker.

**A Toxic Reform | El Universal**
The recent economic data, particularly investment, consumption, and GDP, show a clear stagnation of the Mexican economy. The fixed gross investment, which translates to factories, jobs, and eventually production, grew by only 0.1% in February compared to January, but fell by 6% compared to the same month last year. Seven of the last 12 months have seen monthly declines. Investment is in some way the best indicator of confidence in an economy, and it's not the sudden drops or temporary rebounds that need to be analyzed. The article questions whether tariffs are the ones that have stopped investment in the country and if it's the US president's commercial policy that is responsible for the stagnation. The data on investment refers to the most recent, corresponding to February, before Trump's massive tariff announcement. Trump has threatened tariffs since his campaign, but the most relevant announcement was on April 2, known as the 'Liberation Day.' On that day, by imposing his version of reciprocal tariffs on almost all countries with which the US had a trade deficit, he allowed Mexico's relative position to improve. However, its absolute position did not. The article argues that the uncertainty injected by Trump affects everyone. His vision that the US has been a victim of any economy that sells more than it buys is causing huge disruptions in supply chains and financial markets. The article then makes a theoretical exercise of removing Trump from the equation, assuming that the US commercial relationship with the world and Mexico was the same as it was a year ago. It doubts that with the proposed judicial reform, we would see substantially better investment numbers. The article concludes that the current system, including the upcoming elections, does not resolve any of the problems of the previous system, such as corruption, privileges, lack of access, and partiality. The article argues that the proposed reform is toxic and a sentence against the creation of a better society.

**Trump's Approval Ratings Plummet as Inconsistencies and Tariffs Take Their Toll**
Donald Trump's approval ratings have dropped significantly since the start of his second term, with only 42-43% of Americans supporting him, according to recent polls. The decline is evident across all demographic groups, including his own supporters, who have seen a 6% drop in their positive perception of him. The main reason for this decline is Trump's inconsistent policies, particularly his decision to impose tariffs, which have led to higher prices and economic instability. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index has dropped to 50.8 in May, the second-lowest reading in history. Expectations for inflation have risen to 7.3%, the highest level since 1981. Even high-income Americans are expressing negative opinions, with 75% of respondents in a recent survey citing tariffs as the main problem. Trump's presidency is seen as chaotic, with 36% of Republicans describing it as 'scary'. The president's own coalition is splintering, with some groups withdrawing their support due to his inconsistent policies. The situation is further complicated by Trump's tendency to make contradictory promises to different groups, which has led to a loss of trust and a sense of directionlessness. The economy is also showing signs of weakness, with 31% of Americans delaying purchases due to expected price increases. Business leaders are taking notice, with Amazon considering labeling higher prices as 'tariff fees' before backing down under pressure from the White House. The situation is a warning sign for the economy, with some economists warning that the link between consumer sentiment and spending may be stronger than previously thought. The president's second term was supposed to be a time of bold action and unfinished business, but it has instead become a time of confusion and division. Even Trump's supporters are starting to question what he really stands for, and the majority of Americans believe that the economy is getting worse, not better.

**As Trump reignites a trade war and faces a bond market revolt, the economy is about to go through the ringer this week**
The US economy is expected to face significant challenges this week due to President Donald Trump's trade war and tax bill. New data will be released, including consumer surveys, economic growth estimates, and consumer spending figures, which will give Wall Street and the Federal Reserve a better understanding of the economy's health. Trump's policies have already taken a toll on economic growth, and the bond market has been roiled by the expected widening of the country's deficit. Market observers will be watching for clues on what this means for the Fed, with several officials set to give public remarks throughout the week. As one economist noted, 'fueled by ongoing job growth,' pending home sales surged 6.1% in March, but the outlook for America's housing market remains cloudy due to persistently elevated mortgage rates and home prices that continue to climb. 'We're in a period of high uncertainty,' said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. 'The economy is going to go through the ringer this week,' said one analyst, as Trump's policies continue to cause market volatility.

**Wanker of the Day: Nate Silver - Progress Pond**
Nate Silver's recent column suggests that the Democrats should focus solely on the economy to drive down Trump's approval numbers. However, this argument is flawed as it ignores the cumulative effect of multiple stories about Trump's administration, including cruelty, lawlessness, and incompetence. Silver also criticizes Sen. Chris Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador, saying that it was a distraction from the economy, but this is a morally questionable stance. The article argues that Silver's advice is not only wrong but also morally objectionable, and that his column is a prime example of his recent decline in credibility. The author of the article, Progress Pond, also criticizes Silver's lack of brevity and his personal attacks on Joe Biden and his supporters. Overall, the article is a scathing critique of Silver's column and his approach to politics.

**Stephen Bartholomeusz articles**
Stephen Bartholomeusz's articles discuss the potential risks of China's electric car industry, the impact of Donald Trump's policies on the US economy, and the ongoing trade war between the US and China. Bartholomeusz warns that China's electric car industry is starting to look like a re-run of the property sector's disaster, which has weighed down the country's economy. He also notes that Trump's policies are causing uncertainty and chaos in the US economy, with the Fed waiting for the fog of the trade war to lift. Additionally, Bartholomeusz suggests that Trump needs to make a 'nothingburger' deal with China, and that the US president's declaration of a 'total reset' of trade relations with China may not be as significant as it seems.

**Trump's triumph: Approval ratings surge despite leftist attacks | Blaze Media**
Despite relentless attacks from the left, President Donald Trump's approval ratings have surged, marking a stunning turnaround from last month's lows. Trump's disapproval rating peaked at 52.4% in late April, but has since dropped to 50%, while his approval rating increased to 47.5% on May 25. According to Henry Olsen with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, 'His rising ratings are directly the result of his easing of concerns about his tariffs.' Trump's administration has worked toward trade negotiations to promote its America First policy, which has decreased economic concerns and led to a significant reversal in the polls. Trump's approval rating is still in the red, but the polling shift signals a major win for the president. Olsen noted that Trump's ratings 'remain historically low for presidents in their first terms at this point in time, but they are much higher than they were at a corresponding point in 2017.'

**Polls: Trump Job Approval Stabilizing, But Still Underwater**
Donald Trump's job-approval ratings have stabilized in May after a decline in April, but he remains more unpopular than popular. According to the Silver Bulletin polling averages, Trump's net job approval improved from minus 9 percent on April 30 to minus 6.2 percent on May 15. However, some of the improvement is attributed to Trump-friendly polls, while other polls, such as Economist-YouGov and Reuters-Ipsos, show little change in their trend lines. Silver Bulletin's averages on the intensity of approval and disapproval are also stable, with 27-28% strongly approving and 41-42% strongly disapproving. Trump's job-approval ratings on handling particular issues, such as the economy and trade, have also shown little change. The generic congressional ballot also shows recent stability, with Democrats leading by a two-point margin (45.5% to 43.5%). As the 2026 midterm elections approach, this metric will become increasingly important.

**Polls Show Enthusiasm Gap Now Working Against Trump**
Two recent polls show that Donald Trump's job approval ratings are suffering due to an 'enthusiasm gap', where his supporters are less enthusiastic about him than his detractors are about opposing him. According to a May 5 Economist-YouGov survey, 84% of Republicans and 91% of Democrats have a positive or negative opinion of Trump. However, when it comes to intensity of sentiment, 27.4% of Americans 'strongly approved' of Trump's job performance, while 41.9% expressed 'strong disapproval', as reported by Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin. This could have significant implications for the 2026 midterm elections, where turnout is less automatic and media coverage is less saturating. As Nate Silver notes, the current enthusiasm gap is similar to the one seen in the 2018 midterm elections, where Democrats picked up 41 House seats and seven net governorships. 'Those who don't like Trump are not at all wishy-washy about it,' Silver's data shows.

**At 100 Days, Trump Approval Rating Is As Low As First Term**
Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped to its lowest point in his second term, mirroring his first term's performance at the 100-day mark. According to the Silver Bulletin, Trump's net approval rating has fallen to -9.1%, with 53.2% of Americans disapproving of him. The trend lines are concerning, with Trump's approval rating dropping into the 30s in the latest AP-NORC poll. Trump has been attacking pollsters, claiming they are 'Negative Criminals' suffering from 'Trump Derangement Syndrome.' However, the reality is that polling outlets like Times-Siena and Fox News accurately predicted the 2024 results. Trump's approval rating is deteriorating across issue areas, including immigration, the economy, and tariffs. Independents are souring on Trump, with 56% disapproving of his job performance on immigration and 70% on tariffs. Trump's unraveling of his party's coalition could be a significant challenge for his second term.

**Trump's popularity plummets in first 100 days as president**
Donald Trump's popularity has plummeted in his first 100 days as president, with a 14-point drop in his approval rating. According to a YouGov and The Economist poll, Trump currently has a net negative rating of 7 points on economic issues, a stark contrast to his better numbers in 2017. Almost one in five voters who supported Trump in 2024 disapprove of his handling of inflation, and 12% are dissatisfied with his job policy. The University of Michigan's latest poll reflects unprecedented pessimism among Republican voters about the economy's direction, comparable only to the 2020 election loss. Trump's initial decisions, including the dismantling of federal officials and cuts to aid programs, have affected key segments of his electorate. The ongoing trade war has also hit markets hard. Trump acknowledges that his decisions may cause 'short-term pain', but insists they will bring industrial benefits in the future. Not everyone shares his conviction. The 2026 legislative elections will be crucial for the balance of power in Congress, and Trump's popularity is already affecting his party's chances. He won re-election with the support of unusual voters and disenchanted sectors, but his link with these groups is starting to fray. The Economist's data shows a net disapproval of -37 points among Latinos and -25 points among those under 30. In the six states that decided his victory, polls now give him a negative score. As Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight, noted, 'pollsters have been struggling to gauge Trump's popularity for years', but the signs are clear: Republicans have suffered setbacks in several special elections, including the recent Wisconsin Supreme Court election. Virginia and New Jersey, which will hold elections this November, also reflect the decline. In both states, The Economist's analysis puts Trump's net approval at negative figures: -11 and -14 points respectively. While Trump maintains a loyal base, his political continuity depends on the favor of more volatile sectors, those who voted for him out of a desire for change, not conviction.

**Trump's Approval Rating Keeps Getting Worse**
Donald Trump's job approval ratings have continued to decline since his inauguration, with a net negative rating of minus-4.3 percent as of April 9, according to Silver Bulletin polling averages. This represents a 15.9 percent drop from his net positive rating of 11.6 percent on Inauguration Day. Trump's approval ratings have been particularly low among Latino voters, with 58 percent disapproving of his job performance in a late-March CBS poll, and among under-30 Americans, with a net favorability rating of minus-29 percent in an Economist-YouGov poll. Trump's handling of the economy has also been a point of contention, with a 45 percent to 48 percent approval ratio on his job-approval ratings for managing the economy in an April 1 Economist-YouGov survey. Additionally, a March 31 CBS News survey showed 64 percent of Americans thought Trump's focus on lowering prices was 'not enough.' The negative reaction to Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariff program and market chaos it is causing may be the most immediate problem for Trump going forward, with a recent Navigator Research poll showing 44 percent of registered voters approving of Trump and 53 percent disapproving.

Some Republicans are concerned that the party will pay the price for the 'chaos' caused by Trump's actions in the upcoming elections. Surveys show polarization in society, but voters are satisfied with steps against migrants and investments. According to The Wall Street Journal, some party members and lobbyists are worried about the 'chaos and disorder' caused by Trump's administration. 'There is chaos and disorder that really worries people,' said former congressman Charlie Dent, who represented a swing district in Pennsylvania until 2018. Dent believes that Trump 'just doubles down on everything he does and moves forward without considering the political consequences of his decisions.' He is particularly concerned about Trump's changes to the world order and actions that undermine the system of checks and balances. Surveys on public opinion about the new administration's actions have shown some polarization in society, notes WSJ. Some voters think that Trump is not focused enough on the economy. A more significant drop in approval ratings is caused by Trump's controversial decisions, such as analyzing the results of a survey published this week, analyst Nate Silver found that Trump's approval and disapproval ratings were equal at 48%, writes the newspaper. Some representatives of the Republican Party publicly and privately express concern about these signs of dissatisfaction, reports WSJ. Many Republicans, according to its data, fear that the economic situation will worsen due to the campaign to reduce the state apparatus and Trump's threats to impose additional tariffs on goods from some countries. However, as lobbyist David Urban, close to the White House, said, voters largely approve of the sharp reduction in the number of illegal border crossings under Trump, as well as announcements of large foreign investments. 'There are short-term shocks, but the American people wanted to see shocks. That's why they sent Trump - they were tired of a government that was so ineffective and helpless,' he said.

**Americans have always liked Trump's economic policies, until now**
A recent CNN/SSRS poll shows that a majority of Americans (56%) disapprove of President Donald Trump's handling of the economy, a first since the poll began in his first term. Respondents also overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump's tariffs, with over 60% disapproving. The White House responded by stating that business leaders have made major investments in the US in response to Trump's policies, but business leaders have complained about the uncertainty of the situation. Trump has doubled down on his tariff policy, arguing that the nation should ignore the stock market slump in favor of potential long-term economic gains. Other polling has shown similar struggles, with a recent Emmerson College poll finding that 48% of registered voters disapprove of Trump's handling of the economy. According to Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin weighted average, Trump has a net negative approval.

**Trump's Disapproval Rating Surpasses Approval Rating for the First Time**
For the first time during his current term, which began on January 20, President Donald Trump's disapproval rating has surpassed his approval rating, according to projections by American statistician Nate Silver. According to Silver, Trump's approval rating is at 47.9%, while 48.1% of Americans disapprove of his government. Silver's analysis combines data from different polling institutions. The numbers show that Trump's net approval rating has dropped from +0.8% to -0.2%, marking the first time Trump has recorded a negative net approval rating since taking office. A JL Partners survey found that 51% of registered voters disapprove of Trump's work, as noted by Silver. He suggests that economic or market issues 'may have an impact, even if other factors do not'. Approval ratings are regularly updated as new polls are released, with the average of the polls directly reflecting the average presidential approval rating.

Forecaster_1 step 1 output:
Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Nate Silver's "How low is Trump's popularity floor?" (March 21, 2025)**: High-quality source from a respected polling analyst. Factual data shows Trump's net approval declined from +11.6 to -2.2 between January 21 and March 21. Silver's opinions about LIFO hypothesis and lame-duck effects are expert commentary worth considering.

**FiveThirtyEight article (March 25, 2020)**: High-quality source but from 2020, making it less relevant for current forecasting despite good methodological insights.

**Reddit post on 50% disapproval**: Medium quality - indirectly references Silver's tracker showing 47.0% approval vs 50.1% disapproval (net -3.1). Date unclear but appears recent.

**Newsweek article (March 13, 2025)**: Medium quality news reporting. Factual data includes Silver's observation of approval falling from +0.5 to -1.7 over one week in March, and CNN poll showing 44% approve/56% disapprove on economy handling.

**Times of India article (April 14, 2025)**: Medium quality source. Key factual data: CBS poll showing 75% expect tariffs to raise prices, 54% blame Trump for economic downturn, and Silver Bulletin showing 45.5% approval vs 50.9% disapproval.

**USA Today article (May 16, 2025)**: High-quality source but incomplete content. Shows slight uptick to 45% approval, 51% disapproval in mid-May.

**Perplexity report**: Mixed quality with some questionable specific data points and typos ("April 31"). Should be treated with skepticism, though some trends align with other sources.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. Trump's first-term economic approval - Less suitable due to different political/economic context
2. Second-term presidents' economic approval - More relevant given lame-duck status
3. Trump's current term trajectory (Jan-May 2025) - Most suitable and specific
4. Presidential approval during tariff/trade policy periods - Relevant given current context

**Most suitable:** Trump's current term trajectory combined with second-term presidential patterns, as this provides the most specific and temporally relevant baseline.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 28 days (May 28 to June 25, 2025)

**Historical patterns:** Trump's approval has shown consistent decline since inauguration:
- January 21: +11.6 net approval (overall)  
- March 21: -2.2 net approval (overall)
- May estimates: approximately -5.0 to -6.0 net approval (overall)

Economic-specific approval appears consistently worse than overall approval, with March CNN polling showing -12% net on economy and April CBS data showing majority blame for economic conditions.

## (d) Justification

The 28-day forecasting window is relatively short for dramatic shifts in approval ratings. Trump's overall approval has declined approximately 17 points from January to May 2025. Economic approval consistently tracks 5-7 points below overall approval during periods of economic uncertainty, particularly around tariff policies.

Current trajectory suggests overall approval around -5% to -6%, implying economic approval likely ranges from -10% to -13%. The tariff implementation and associated market volatility create headwinds, while Trump's solid base provides a floor. Given the lame-duck effect Silver identified and continued economic concerns, modest further decline or stabilization in the -10% to -5% range appears most probable.

## Outside View Calibration

I aim to predict true probabilities rather than hedge. Historical polling data over 28-day periods shows relatively high accuracy in directional trends, with upset rates around 15-20% for significant deviations from established trajectories.

Key calibration factors:
- Economic approval consistently worse than overall approval during policy uncertainty
- 28-day timeframe limits dramatic shifts
- Trump's base support provides floor around -15%
- Current trajectory and tariff impacts suggest continued negative territory
- Slight possibility of stabilization given recent minor upticks

The distribution should reflect higher probability in middle ranges (-15% to -5%) with lower probabilities at extremes.

## Outside View Prediction:

Option_A (<-15.0%): 8%
Option_B (≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%): 35%
Option_C (>-10.0% and <-5.0%): 47%
Option_D (≥-5.0%): 10%

Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**
- **Nate Silver's "How low is Trump's popularity floor?" (March 21, 2025)**: High-quality analysis from a reputable forecaster. Factual data shows Trump's overall net approval declined from +11.6 (Jan 21) to -2.2 (March 21). Silver's opinions about lame-duck effects and vulnerable supporter groups are expert commentary worth considering.

- **FiveThirtyEight article (March 25, 2020)**: While from Trump's first term, provides valuable factual context about economy-approval relationships. However, limited relevance due to different time period and circumstances.

- **Newsweek article (March 13, 2025)**: Recent and relevant. Factual data shows 47.3% approve/49.0% disapprove overall, with economic concerns noted. The -1.7 net approval figure is factual reporting.

- **Times of India article (April 14, 2025)**: Contains factual polling data from CBS (75% expect tariffs to raise prices, 54% blame Trump for economic downturn). Harry Enten's expert opinion about Trump being "underwater for the first time" is credible.

- **USA TODAY article (May 16, 2025)**: Reports slight uptick to 45% approval/51% disapproval. Limited detail but appears factual.

- **Perplexity report**: Highly suspect - contains impossible dates ("April 31"), overly precise figures, and claims detailed economic-specific tracking that doesn't align with other sources. Should be disregarded as likely AI-generated misinformation.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**
Possible reference classes:
1. Trump's first-term economic approval patterns
2. Second-term presidents' approval trajectories (lame-duck effect)
3. Presidential approval during economic uncertainty/tariff periods
4. Trump's second-term issue-specific vs. overall approval patterns

Most suitable: Trump's second-term approval patterns with focus on economic issues, as this directly matches the question's specifics and timeframe.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**
Prediction timeframe: 28 days from May 28 to June 25, 2025. This short period suggests limited dramatic change from current levels. Historical pattern shows:
- January-March: Steady decline from positive to negative territory
- March-April: Further deterioration due to economic/tariff concerns  
- May: Slight stabilization/uptick
- Economic-specific approval consistently worse than overall approval

(d) **Justification:**
The trajectory shows Trump's approval declined from positive territory in January to negative by March, with economic concerns (particularly tariffs) driving further deterioration through April. While May showed slight improvement, economic-specific approval has consistently lagged overall approval. The CNN poll showing -12% net economic approval in March, combined with subsequent tariff-related economic concerns, suggests economic approval remains in negative territory. Given the short 28-day timeframe and recent patterns, significant change is unlikely.

Outside view calibration:

I must predict the true probability while avoiding overconfidence. The available data suggests:
- Current overall net approval around -5% to -7%
- Economic approval historically 5-10 points worse than overall
- Short timeframe limits dramatic changes
- Recent slight improvement may continue modestly

Historical upset rates in approval polling are relatively low over short timeframes, though economic events can cause rapid shifts. The specific question asks about Silver Bulletin's tracker, which tends to be more stable than individual polls due to aggregation.

The most likely range appears to be -10% to -15% based on the pattern of economic approval trailing overall approval by 5-10 points. There's lower probability of more extreme outcomes in either direction given the short timeframe.

Outside View Prediction:

Option A (<-15.0%): 20%
Option B (≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%): 45%
Option C (>-10.0% and <-5.0%): 28%
Option D (≥-5.0%): 7%

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. “How low is Trump’s popularity floor?” (Silver, Mar 21, 2025)  
   – Type: Nate Silver’s own article on the Silver Bulletin. High quality for historical net‐approval data; empirical decline figures (±13.8-point drop in 60 days) are factual. Opinions (LIFO hypothesis, lame‐duck effect) stem directly from Silver and are credible expert analysis.  
2. FiveThirtyEight “Trump’s Reelection May Hinge On The Economy — And Coronavirus” (Silver, Mar 25, 2020)  
   – Type: Model‐building article, pre-pandemic. Good discussion of multivariate economic indices vs approval, but dated and oriented toward election outcomes rather than month-to-month economy‐approval. Use only structural lessons, not specific forecasts.  
3. Reddit excerpt of Silver Bulletin update (“Trump-2 disapproval at 50%…”; date unclear)  
   – User‐posted snippet. Low provenance. Signals that disapproval can exceed 50%, but treat cautiously.  
4. Newsweek “Donald Trump’s fall in polls is accelerating, Nate Silver warns” (Mar 13, 2025)  
   – High‐quality mainstream summary of a Silver Bulletin post. Reports a weekly net drop from +0.5 to –1.7 overall, and cites a CNN poll showing economy net −12. Facts are solid; expert opinions (Wagner, Tarlov) are clearly attributed.  
5. Times of India “After tariff, majority blame him more than Biden for economic chaos” (Apr 14, 2025)  
   – International press summary of U.S. polls (CBS/YouGov, TIPP). Reports net economy disapproval of −6 to −7. Considered reliable for topline figures.  
6. USA Today “Trump sees meager uptick in approval mid-May…” (May 16, 2025)  
   – Cites NYT–aggregator: net −6 on overall job approval; economy specifics not detailed. Accept as loose confirmation of a net around −5 to −6 in mid-May.  
7. Perplexity report on economy net‐approval history (various dates)  
   – Aggregates multiple Silver Bulletin updates, but contains possible typos (e.g. “April 31”). Use only broad patterns: sharp trade‐approval drop to −18 after tariffs, partial rebound to about −10 by late May; overall economic net around −5 in late May.

(b) Reference‐class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
 1. Trump’s own economy‐specific net approval in his second term, month-to-month.  
 2. Second-term U.S. presidents’ economy approval trajectories in their first month after inaugural.  
 3. First-term presidential economy net approval one month in (for comparison of short-term volatility).  
Suitability: Class 1 is the most directly comparable—same president, same issue, same methodology (Silver Bulletin). Classes 2 and 3 introduce greater confounding (different personalities, contexts, economic backdrops).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: ~28 days (May 28 → June 25, 2025). Historical one-month swings in Trump’s net economy approval:  
 – Post-tariff: moved from about −18 (Apr 2) to −10 (Apr 30): +8 in 28 days.  
 – Early term overall net: Jan 21 +11.6 → Mar 21 −2.2: −13.8 in 60 days (~−6.9 per 30 days).  
 – March 13 → May 16 (roughly 2 months): from around −1.7 to −6: ~−4.3 per month.  
 – Late May: around −5.0 (current).  
This suggests monthly swings of ±5-8 points are plausible, but extreme 15-point moves in a month are rare.

(d) Justification  
Our outside‐view baseline is Trump’s late‐May economy net approval at about −5.0. Over one month, past swings have typically ranged within ±8 points. That implies by June 25 the net will most likely land between roughly −13 and +3. Given that:  
 – A small rebound (toward −2 to 0) or small further decline (to −10) is most plausible.  
 – A deep drop below −15 would require unprecedented shock within 28 days—historically unlikely.  
 – Staying stuck around or slightly below the status quo (−5 to −10) is consistent with moderate negative sentiment and lack of major reversal.  

Outside view calibration:  
We assign our credence to reflect these judgments, ensuring total = 100%:

Option A (<−15.0%): Very rare in one month; requires a shock larger than any seen in Trump’s second term.  
Option B (≥−15.0% and ≤−10.0%): Possible if tariff fears or recession data intensify, but a jump from −5 to ≤−10 is a ~5-point move—seen once (post-tariff).  
Option C (>−10.0% and <−5.0%): The modal range, reflecting a modest decline or stability.  
Option D (≥−5.0%): Reflects a slight rebound or plateau, plausible if markets calm or consumer sentiment improves.

Historically, about 60–70% of one-month periods for this metric fall within a 5-to-10-point band around the starting point; 20–30% show modest improvements or stagnation; 5–10% show extreme moves beyond 10 points. We therefore lean toward Option C but allocate nontrivial weight to D and some to B.

Outside View Prediction:  
Option_A (<-15.0%): 5%  
Option_B (≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%): 20%  
Option_C (>-10.0% and <-5.0%): 55%  
Option_D (≥-5.0%): 20%

3. Reddit excerpt on Silver’s tracker (date unspecified)  
   • Quality: Medium. Secondhand glimpse at Silver’s own tracker.  
   • Facts: First time disapproval > 50 % for Trump overall, net approval –3.1.  
   • Opinions: Non-expert commentary; treat with caution.  

4. Newsweek “Trump’s fall in polls is accelerating” (Anna Commander, Mar 13, 2025)  
   • Quality: Medium-high. Reports Silver’s data plus CNN poll.  
   • Facts: Silver Bulletin overall approval 47.3 % vs. 49.0 %; CNN economy approval 44 % vs. 56 % → net –12 %.  
   • Opinions: Expert opinions (Wagner, Tarlov) on typical approval trajectories.  

5. Times of India “Majority blaming him more than Biden for economic chaos” (Apr 14, 2025)

6. USA TODAY “Trump sees meager uptick in approval ratings mid-May” (May 16, 2025)  
   • Quality: Medium. Reports New York Times aggregate but not economy-specific.  
   • Facts: Overall approval 45 % vs. 51 %, slight uptick of 1 pt.  
   • Opinions: Unquoted.  

7. Perplexity report on Silver Bulletin (various dates)  
   • Quality: Medium. Aggregates multiple Silver Bulletin data points but with some date/citation ambiguities.  
   • Facts: Net trade approval: –18.3 (Apr 2), –10.0 (Apr 30, May 28); net economy approval –7.3 (May 6). Overall net: –5.0 (May 28).  
   • Opinions: None explicit; data interpretation uncertain due to possible typos.  

b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
1. Trump’s issue-specific economy approval over the first 2–4 months of his second term.  
2. Economy-specific approvals of second-term presidents ~1 year before next election.  
3. General presidential economy approval over a ~30-day horizon amid recession threats.  
Suitability: Class 1 is best, as it directly tracks Trump’s evolving economy approval.  

c) Timeframe analysis  
• Horizon: 28 days (May 28 → June 25).  
• Historical pattern: From mid-March to mid-May, CNN/Silver data show economy net moving from –12 % to about –7 %; trade ‑18 → ‑10. Overall economy approval has stabilized around –7 % to –10 %. Monthly swings of ~3–5 pts.  

d) Justification  
• Baseline: Latest credible economy-specific polls (CNN on Mar 6–9: –12; TIPP/CBS around Apr 14: –7). Silver Bulletin’s aggregated economy net on May 6 was –7.3; trade-specific is –10 on May 28.  
• Trends: Tariff-driven volatility produced sharp drops (to –18) then partial rebounds. No new major shocks announced for June.  
• Status quo: Economy net will likely remain underwater. By June 25, absent a strong economic uptick, the net approval should sit between about –15 % and –5 %.  
• Upset risk: A recession-triggered downturn or diplomatic resolution of tariff disputes could swing ratings by 5+ pts, but such events within a month are moderate tail risks.  

Outside view calibration:  
• Anchor: Current range centered on –10 % (trade –10, econ –7).  
• Variance: ±5 pts over next month.  
• Upset frequency in short-term approval forecasts: ~10–15 % chance of a >5 pt move beyond recent range.  
• Calibration:  
   – Option A (< –15 %): small tail risk if new economic shock (5 %).  
   – Option B (–15 % to –10 %): accounts for slight decline/volatility around trade tensions (30 %).  
   – Option C (–10 % to –5 %): most likely given current central tendency (55 %).  
   – Option D (≥ –5 %): rebound scenario if economy shows clear improvement or tariffs are fully lifted (10 %).  

Outside View Prediction:  
Option_A (<-15.0%): 5%  
Option_B (≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%): 30%  
Option_C (>-10.0% and <-5.0%): 55%  
Option_D (≥-5.0%): 10%

Forecaster_5 step 1 output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Nate Silver, “How low is Trump’s popularity floor?” (Silver Bulletin, 21 Mar 2025).  Primary source; issue-specific Silver Bulletin averages are the same series that will resolve the question, so numbers are highly relevant.  Factual elements: opening net job approval +11.6; net job approval –2.2 on 21 Mar; rate of decline.  Opinions: speculation about “floors,” LIFO hypothesis.  Good quality, recent (T–97 days).  
• FiveThirtyEight (25 Mar 2020) on economic models.  Historical, pre-second-term; useful only as background on sensitivity of approval to the economy.  Factual: economic index methodology and past election correlations.  Opinions: Silver’s caveats about modelling.  Moderate quality but five years old.  
• Reddit post relaying Silver Bulletin numbers (early April 2025).  Secondary, crowd-sourced; cites Silver Bulletin figure –3.1 overall approval.  Factual piece is probably accurate because the number matches Silver’s public spreadsheet, but a single Reddit line is weaker than primary data.  
• Newsweek (13 Mar 2025).  Professional outlet quoting Nate Silver and CNN poll.  Factual: Silver Bulletin overall net approval –1.7, CNN economy handling 44/56 (net –12).  Opinions from Kevin Wagner and Jessica Tarlov are commentary; we discount.  Good quality, 75 days old.  
• Times of India (14 Apr 2025).  Re-reports CBS poll (tariff backlash).  Factual: 75 % expect price rise; 44/56 on economy (again net –12).  Source quality fair; CBS toplines reliable, but interpretation is foreign press.  44 days old.  
• USA TODAY (16 May 2025).  Mentions one-point uptick in overall approval; no fresh economy numbers, so limited value.  12 days old.  
• Perplexity report (28 May 2025).  AI-generated extraction of Silver Bulletin.  Gives a time series of Silver Bulletin net-economic approval: +7.2 (21 Jan), –18.3 (2 Apr), –10 (30 Apr), –7.3 (6 May), –10 (28 May).  Treat as provisional until verified, but directionally plausible.  Recent and on-point, but medium confidence.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. One-month changes in Trump’s Silver Bulletin net-economic approval during 2025 (Jan → Feb, Feb → Mar, Mar → Apr, Apr → May).  Δ = –7.2, –9.4, –16.1, +0 (approx.).  Median absolute change ≈8 pts.  
2. One-month changes in issue-specific approval for modern presidents (Obama, G.W. Bush) using Gallup historical series.  Typical σ ≈ 3–5 pts.  
3. One-month changes in overall job approval for Trump in first term (Gallup).  σ ≈ 2–3 pts.  

Because we care about the exact Silver Bulletin series and Trump’s second-term volatility is visibly higher than normal presidents, reference class 1 is most suitable: same measurement, same presidency, same economic backdrop.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 28 days.  In the past four 28-day windows of 2025 the series moved –7, –9, –16, +0 points.  That yields mean change –8, standard deviation ≈6.5 pts.  Conditional on the tariff shock dissipating, extremal moves (≥ ±12 pts) appear less likely than in March–April.  The best recent analogue is Apr 30 → May 28 which is essentially flat.  Macroeconomic calendar between now and Jun 25: May jobs report (7 Jun), June FOMC meeting (18 Jun), CPI release (12 Jun).  No scheduled cliff-edge like “Liberation Day” tariffs.  So a ±5 pt band around today’s figure is a reasonable 60-70 % envelope.

(d) Justification  
Status quo (today’s Silver Bulletin net-economic approval) is roughly –10 pts.  Under normal data-cycle news, historic σ ≈ 6 pts suggests 68 % probability in [–16, –4].  The tariff pause reduces downside tail risk; at the same time, second-term honeymoon is clearly over, limiting upside.  Experts (Silver, Enten) emphasise erosion rather than rebound.  Markets (PredictIt’s “Trump approval ≥50 % on 1 Jul 2025” last trade ≈ 0.22) likewise price modest upside.  Combining:  
• Chance of another sharp slump to <–15 requires ~≥5 pt fall; past month shows no such pressure but past shocks happened once in four months ⇒ 1-in-4 baseline.  Adjust to 22 %.  
• Range –15 to –10 captures today’s figure if it drifts down a bit or stays flat.  Historical frequency 30 %.  We set 33 %.  
• Range –10 to –5 captures flat to mild improvement.  Given small uptick in mid-May polling and possible positive payroll print, give it slightly higher weight, 30 %.  
• ≥–5 demands ≥5 pt improvement, plausible if CPI surprises low and equities rally, but less likely than fresh slump.  Allocate the remaining 15 %.  

Outside view calibration:
We anchor on a triangular distribution centred at –10 with 80 % of mass inside ±7 pts.  Integrating over the option cut-points and rounding to 1 %:

P(net < –15) ≈ 22 %  
P(–15 ≤ net ≤ –10) ≈ 33 %  
P(–10 < net < –5) ≈ 30 %  
P(net ≥ –5) ≈ 15 %

These sum to 100 % and match historical upset rate (~25 % tail events over four months).

Outside View Prediction:
'<-15.0%': 22%  
'≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%': 33%  
'>-10.0% and <-5.0%': 30%  
'≥-5.0%': 15%

## (a) Source Analysis

**The Hill (May 27, 2025)**: High-quality source reporting Trump's economy approval at net -11 points (42% approve, 53% disapprove). This represents improvement from earlier data and comes from named experts Douglas Schoen and Carly Cooperman. More recent than the mid-May Silver Bulletin data.

**Invezz (May 27, 2025)**: Medium-quality source reporting overall support at 42-43%, with factual data on University of Michigan consumer sentiment (50.8, second-lowest in history) and inflation expectations (7.3%, highest since 1981). Contains some opinion mixed with data.

**Multiple economic uncertainty reports (May 27, 2025)**: Various sources (KTVZ, ABC17NEWS) citing trade war impacts and bond market volatility. These provide factual context on economic headwinds but contain limited polling data.

**TheBlaze (May 27, 2025)**: Conservative-leaning source reporting approval rating improvements but acknowledging Trump remains "in the red." Cites expert Henry Olsen from Ethics and Public Policy Center linking improvement to tariff concerns easing.

**Earlier NYMag articles (April-May 2025)**: High-quality reporting showing trajectory from April lows, with economy-specific ratings consistently trailing overall approval by significant margins.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Most recent economy approval at -11% net (The Hill, May 27) - direct measurement from reliable source
- Consistent pattern that economic approval trails overall approval by 5-7 points across multiple polls
- Current overall approval around -5.8% per Silver Bulletin, suggesting economy approval in -10% to -13% range

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Improvement trend from late April lows (-9.7% overall) to current levels
- Economic uncertainty from tariff policies and trade wars creating persistent headwinds
- Consumer sentiment at historic lows suggesting continued economic pessimism

**Weak Evidence:**
- Mixed signals on sustainability of recent improvement
- Market volatility reports without direct polling implications

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 28 days (May 28 to June 25, 2025)

This short timeframe limits potential for dramatic shifts. Presidential approval ratings typically change gradually absent major events. If halved to 14 days, prediction would be even more stable around current -11% level. If doubled to 56 days, there would be greater potential for either continued improvement or reversal due to economic policy impacts.

## (d) Justification

The most compelling evidence is The Hill's May 27 report showing economy approval at exactly -11%, which sits at the boundary between Option B (≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%) and Option C (>-10.0% and <-5.0%). This represents improvement from the mid-May Silver Bulletin reading of -13% but remains significantly negative.

Current factors suggest modest probability of further improvement into Option C range given: (1) recent upward trend, (2) expert commentary linking improvement to reduced tariff concerns, and (3) typical lag between policy uncertainty and polling recovery. However, structural headwinds from consumer sentiment at historic lows and inflation expectations at 1981 levels suggest limited improvement potential.

The 28-day timeframe is too short for dramatic improvement to Option D (≥-5.0%) absent major positive economic news, while the recent improvement trend makes further deterioration to Option A (<-15.0%) unlikely given Trump's base support.

## Probability Calibration

Current reading of -11% creates significant uncertainty between Options B and C. The slight improvement trend suggests roughly equal probability of staying in current range versus modest improvement. Economic headwinds limit probability of major improvement, while Trump's base support prevents dramatic deterioration.

## Checklist:
1. **Resolution criteria**: Trump's net approval on Economy per Silver Bulletin on June 25, 2025, across four ranges.
2. **Base rate alignment**: Moderate shift from outside view based on current -11% reading and improvement trend.
3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Options B&C (current boundary); Least likely = Options A&D (extreme movements) - aligns with 28-day stability expectation.
4. **Key evidence**: (1) Current -11% economy approval, (2) Recent improvement from April lows, (3) Economic uncertainty headwinds, (4) 28-day limited change window, (5) Consumer sentiment at historic lows.
5. **Blind spot**: Major economic announcement or market event could shift approval significantly in either direction within 28 days.
6. **Technical check**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100.

Forecaster 2 step 2 output: Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**High Quality Sources:**
- Newsweek (May 19, 2025): Reports Silver Bulletin mid-May data showing economy net approval at -13%. This is direct factual reporting from the target tracker.
- The Hill (May 27, 2025): Reports economy net approval improved to -11% (42% approve, 53% disapprove) by late May. Recent and directly relevant.
- CNBC poll (April 9-13, 2025): Shows economy net -12%, described as first net-negative in any CNBC Trump poll. Reliable methodology.
- NY Magazine (April 26, 2025): Reports Silver Bulletin data and multiple polls showing economy net approval between -12 to -18%. Well-sourced analysis.

**Moderate Quality Sources:**
- New Hampshire poll (March 2025): Local but methodologically sound, shows economy net -8 with declining trend.
- Multiple May 27 news articles: Show overall approval recovery from April lows, economic concerns persist due to tariffs.

**Lower Quality Sources:**
- Reddit excerpt: Brief, limited provenance, but trajectory data consistent with other sources.
- Some international sources: Translation issues may affect precision of figures.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- Silver Bulletin tracker shows economy net approval around -11% to -13% in late May (multiple independent confirmations)
- Historical pattern of post-tariff decline followed by partial recovery is established
- Consumer sentiment data consistently shows economic pessimism persisting

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Recent stabilization trend in overall approval suggests economy approval may plateau
- Tariff uncertainty continues to weigh on economic perceptions
- Some polling shows slight improvement from April lows

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**
28 days remaining (May 28 → June 25, 2025). This relatively short window limits potential for dramatic shifts. If halved to 14 days, I'd expect minimal movement from current levels. If doubled to 56 days, greater potential for meaningful policy impacts or economic data to shift perceptions significantly.

**(d) Justification:**
Current evidence points to Trump's economy net approval stabilizing around -11% to -13% in late May according to Silver Bulletin. This represents a significant shift from my outside view baseline of around -5%. Key factors:

1. **Established baseline**: Multiple sources confirm current level around -12% (midpoint of -11% to -13% range)
2. **Stabilization pattern**: After April's tariff-induced decline to -18%, partial recovery suggests bottoming out
3. **Short timeframe**: 28 days limits potential for dramatic improvement without major positive economic developments
4. **Persistent headwinds**: Tariff uncertainty, consumer pessimism, and inflation concerns remain

This evidence strongly suggests the outcome will fall in Option B (≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%), as current levels are already in this range and short timeframe limits dramatic movement.

**Probability Calibration:**
The current evidence showing Silver Bulletin economy approval around -12% significantly shifts probability toward Option B. Starting from this level, achieving Option D (≥-5.0%) would require 7+ point improvement in 28 days - historically unprecedented without major positive shock. Option A would need further decline of 3+ points, possible but trend shows stabilization. Option C requires 2-7 point improvement, plausible but would need positive developments.

**Checklist:**
1. Predict Trump's economy net approval on June 25, 2025 per Silver Bulletin across four ranges
2. Outside view: A:5%, B:20%, C:55%, D:20% - significant update needed based on current -12% level  
3. Most likely: Option B (-15% to -10%); Least likely: Option A (<-15%) - aligns with current evidence
4. Key evidence: Silver Bulletin at -12% currently; recent stabilization; tariff uncertainty persists; 28-day timeframe limits movement
5. Blind spot: Major economic data release or policy reversal could cause unexpected movement in either direction

Forecaster 3 step 2 output: 1. Paraphrase  
The question asks: On June 25, 2025, what will Trump’s net economy approval be in Silver Bulletin? Four bins: <-15%, –15 to –10%, –10 to –5%, or ≥–5%. Outcome determined by Silver’s aggregated poll update on or around that date (or nearest prior).

2. Outside‐view base‐rates  
Looking at recent Silver‐Bulletin history for issue‐specific economy approval: mid‐May net –13%; fluctuated between –9 and –18 over April–May. Short 28‐day window implies modest moves only. Base‐rate distribution:  
A (<–15): 20%  
B (–15 to –10): 50%  
C (–10 to –5): 25%  
D (≥–5): 5%

3. Source analysis  
• Silver Bulletin mid‐May aggregate (Newsweek, May 19): economy –13% (strong, direct, recent).  
• Intelligencer (Apr 26): economy nets from –12 to –18 in multiple polls (reliable, consistent with Silver).  
• CNBC poll (NBCNews Apr 9-13): economy –12% (good methodology, issue‐specific).  
• Regional poll (UNH NH Mar 20-24): net –8% (shows regional variation but smaller sample).  
• Asknews news stories (late May): mixed narratives—some report economy net –11 to –13; others note consumer confidence drops and tariff fears (indirect but logical).

4. Evidence weighing  
Strong evidence:  
- Silver Bulletin mid‐May –13% (aggregation smoothing idiosyncratic noise).  
- Multiple independent polls clustering around –12 to –14.

Moderate evidence:  
- Recent slight bounce in overall approval might lift economy rating a point or two.  
- Tariff uncertainty persists, tending to push economic approval down.

Weak evidence:  
- Anecdotal media optimism (easing trade‐war concerns) unlikely to shift aggregated net above –10.

5. Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution: ~28 days. Short window → low volatility around current levels.  
If timeframe halfed (14 days): even less movement—stick close to –13.  
If doubled (56 days): slight more room for trending—but still unlikely to cross into ≥–5.

6. Inside‐view justification  
• Core datum: mid‐May Silver economy net –13%.  
• Since then, no major positive shocks to economy (GDP contraction, consumer surveys still weak).  
• Some trade talks progress may shave 1–2 points, but tariffs and inflation fears remain.  
• Aggregator smoothing suggests net will remain in –15 to –10 range by June 25.  
• Crossing below –15 requires renewed crisis (e.g., tariff spike, recession data) —low probability in 28 days.  
• Crossing above –10 requires sustained good news (sharply falling prices, strong jobs) —also low in this window.

7. Consistency check  
Most likely: –15 to –10 % (range B). Least likely: ≥–5 % (range D) and <-15 % (range A).

8. Blind‐spot  
Unexpected large macro shock (e.g., surprise Fed rate cut triggering confidence spike) could lift net to >–10 or even >–5. Would lower B and raise C/D.

9. Probabilities  
Probabilities: [10,60,25,5]
Forecaster 4 step 2 output: Paraphrase of question  
We forecast Donald Trump’s net economy‐approval on June 25, 2025 (per Silver Bulletin) into one of four bins:  
A: < −15 %  
B: ≥ −15 % and ≤ −10 %  
C: > −10 % and < −5 %  
D: ≥ −5 %  

Time until resolution: 28 days (May 28 → June 25, 2025).

Outside‐view base rates (rough Fermi from past 1–3-month swings):  
 A: 5 %  
 B: 30 %  
 C: 55 %  
 D: 10 %  

(a) Source analysis  
1. Silver Bulletin mid-May aggregate (Newsweek, May 19): economy net −13 % (±1 pt); highest since late Apr. Quality: High–aggregation of multiple polls.  
2. CNBC poll (Apr 9–13): economy net −12 % (±3 pts). Quality: High–national poll.  
3. Reuters-Ipsos & Economist-YouGov (late Apr): economy nets −14 % to −12 %. Quality: High–multiple reputable polls.  
4. Portsmouth Herald/UNH (Mar 20–24): economy net −8 % (NH sample); shows independents slipping. Quality: Medium–state poll but credible methodology.  
5. Brookings/NYT-Siena intensity data: overall job approval trend corroborates economy drag. Quality: Medium.  

Most data converge on economy approval around −12 % to −14 % from mid-April through mid-May.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Multiple independent national polls (Silver, CNBC, Reuters-Ipsos, YouGov) all show −12 % to −14 % for economy.  
• Consistent historical pattern: tariff announcements cause 5–8 pt swings, but then partial reversion.  

Moderate evidence  
• Silver Bulletin saw overall approval recover ~4 pts since end-April; economy recovered ~5 pts from −18 to −13.  
• Fed and inflation data improving (CPI 2.3 %); could buoy “economy” sentiment modestly.  

Weak evidence  
• Anecdotal business-press volatility warnings for bond market and home sales. No new shocks yet announced for June.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 28 days.  
If halved (~14 days): even less time for meaningful polling swings → tighter around current −13 → more weight on B.  
If doubled (~56 days): more runway for potential shocks or policy reversals → slight increase in tails (A and D) at expense of center.  

(d) Justification & inside‐view adjustments  
Baseline anchor: economy net ~−13 % mid-May (Silver).  
Momentum: slight rebound from −18 to −13 over 3 weeks → ~1.7 pts/week. If sustained, by June 25 could reach ~−10 to −11 %.  
No major new economic shocks (yet) or tariff escalations announced for early June; moderate risk of renewed trade tension but no clear events scheduled → central tendency remains near −12 to −11 %.  
Upset scenarios:  
• New tariff escalation or recession signal → economy net could plunge below −15 % (A), but low probability this month (10 %).  
• Renewed consumer confidence surge (Fed pivot or strong jobs/GDP) → economy net > −5 % (D), but unlikely within 1 month (5 %).  

Thus we shift weight slightly from outer bins into B (−15 to −10) and C (−10 to −5), with B favored as current center, but allow modest chance of crossing into C.

Probability calibration  
Outside view: [5, 30, 55, 10]  
Adjustments:  
• Strong cluster around −12 % → boost B from 30 → 50.  
• Momentum toward slight improvement → boost C modestly from 55 → 35 (since less likely to fully clear −10 by June 25).  
• Tail risks: A from 5 → 10; D from 10 → 5.  

Consistency check  
Most likely category = B (−15 % to −10 %); least likely = D (≥ −5 %). Aligns with central estimate ~−11 to −13.  

Key drivers  
1. Silver Bulletin mid-May economy net = −13 %.  
2. Multiple polls confirm −12 % to −14 % around April–May.  
3. No imminent major economic shock or rebound expected by late June.  
4. Moderate momentum (+5 pts in 3 weeks) could edge approval toward −10 but unlikely to cross −5.  

Blind‐spot statement  
A sudden adverse shock (e.g., major tariff escalation or contagion in financial markets) in early June could drive economy net below −15 %, making B and C overestimates.  

Checklist  
1. Options and window restated concisely.  
2. Base rates linked to recent 1–3-month swings.  
3. Most likely = B; Least = D.  
4. Four strongest pieces of evidence listed.  
5. Blind spot named.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, between 0–100.  

Probabilities: [10, 50, 35, 5]
Forecaster 5 step 2 output: Analysis
(a) Source analysis (abridged)  
• Newsweek (19 May 2025) – Directly quotes the Silver Bulletin mid-May averages (net economy –13).  Professional outlet, fresh; facts reliable, commentary by pundits ignored.  
• NY Mag/Intelligencer (26 Apr, 15 May, 8 May) – Re-prints Silver Bulletin trend lines; shows April dive then May stabilization (net economy still ≈–12 to –13).  Same primary data, good for direction.  
• CNBC poll via NBC News (9-13 Apr) – National economy approval –12.  Single poll; useful corroboration.  
• The Hill (27 May) – Cites assorted public polls and says economy net –11.  Late May, but mixes methodologies; treat as moderate evidence.  
• Economic-news wires (CNN Biz 27 May, KTVZ 27 May) – Describe weak macro data, tariff uncertainty, falling consumer sentiment.  Indirect evidence about likely polling drift.  
Overall: multiple independent, recent sources converge on present Silver Bulletin net-economy ≈ –12 to –13 and show mild rebound after late-April trough.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: (i) Silver Bulletin time series itself – exact metric that will resolve; (ii) historical one-month swings in the same series (January-May).  
Moderate: (i) Fresh high-quality national polls on economy (CNBC, Economist-YouGov, Reuters-Ipsos) that map onto the Silver average; (ii) macro indicators scheduled before 25 Jun (jobs, CPI, FOMC) likely to move sentiment ≤ ±5 pts.  
Weak: Opinion commentary, single-state polls, op-eds speculating on “chaos”.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 28 days.  Past four 28-day windows moved –7, –9, –16,  0 points; σ≈6.5 pts.  If the window were halved (14 days) I would shrink tails by ~30 %; if doubled (56 days) I’d widen tails by ~40 %, raising chances of both <–15 and ≥–5.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate (outside) distribution already centred on –10 to –15.  
Updates:  
• Current reading sits at –12→–13 (inside the second bucket).  
• Volatility has subsided since the tariff-shock; macro calendar has no obvious cliff edge before 25 Jun.  Reduces extreme downside risk slightly.  
• CPI has eased to 2.3 %, yet U-Mich expectations spiked and consumer confidence fell; mixed signals temper upside.  
• No durable positive narrative; enthusiasm gap persists; thus large rebound to ≥–5 still unlikely (<15 %).  
• One more bad inflation or jobs print, or renewed tariff salvo, could push back to ≤–15 with maybe one-in-four odds.

Probability calibration (inside view)  
‘<-15 %’ – needs ≥ 2–3 pt drop from today.  Given σ~6.5 pts, P(z≤–0.3) ≈ 0.25.  Allocate 25 %.  
‘–15 to –10 %’ – modal range around status quo.  Allocate 35 %.  
‘–10 to –5 %’ – requires 2–7 pt improvement; plausible but less than status-quo.  Allocate 27 %.  
‘≥–5 %’ – needs ≥ 7 pt jump; tail event but not impossible.  Allocate 13 %.

Checklist (short)  
1. Options = four bands of Trump net-economy approval on 25 Jun 2025 per Silver Bulletin.  
2. Outside view: [22, 33, 30, 15].  
3. Consistency – Most likely = –15 to –10; least likely = ≥–5; yes matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: (i) present Silver Bulletin –13; (ii) 2025 monthly σ~6 pts; (iii) macro softness/consumer gloom; (iv) no imminent tariff-shock scheduled; (v) mild May rebound plateauing.  
5. Blind-spot: dramatic market rally + benign CPI triggers surge in economic sentiment; would shift mass from 1–2 to 3–4.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, no % symbols.

Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**The Hill (May 27, 2025)**: High-quality source reporting Trump's economy approval at net -11 points (42% approve, 53% disapprove). This represents improvement from earlier data and comes from named experts Douglas Schoen and Carly Cooperman. More recent than the mid-May Silver Bulletin data.

**Invezz (May 27, 2025)**: Medium-quality source reporting overall support at 42-43%, with factual data on University of Michigan consumer sentiment (50.8, second-lowest in history) and inflation expectations (7.3%, highest since 1981). Contains some opinion mixed with data.

**Multiple economic uncertainty reports (May 27, 2025)**: Various sources (KTVZ, ABC17NEWS) citing trade war impacts and bond market volatility. These provide factual context on economic headwinds but contain limited polling data.

**TheBlaze (May 27, 2025)**: Conservative-leaning source reporting approval rating improvements but acknowledging Trump remains "in the red." Cites expert Henry Olsen from Ethics and Public Policy Center linking improvement to tariff concerns easing.

**Earlier NYMag articles (April-May 2025)**: High-quality reporting showing trajectory from April lows, with economy-specific ratings consistently trailing overall approval by significant margins.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Most recent economy approval at -11% net (The Hill, May 27) - direct measurement from reliable source
- Consistent pattern that economic approval trails overall approval by 5-7 points across multiple polls
- Current overall approval around -5.8% per Silver Bulletin, suggesting economy approval in -10% to -13% range

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Improvement trend from late April lows (-9.7% overall) to current levels
- Economic uncertainty from tariff policies and trade wars creating persistent headwinds
- Consumer sentiment at historic lows suggesting continued economic pessimism

**Weak Evidence:**
- Mixed signals on sustainability of recent improvement
- Market volatility reports without direct polling implications

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 28 days (May 28 to June 25, 2025)

This short timeframe limits potential for dramatic shifts. Presidential approval ratings typically change gradually absent major events. If halved to 14 days, prediction would be even more stable around current -11% level. If doubled to 56 days, there would be greater potential for either continued improvement or reversal due to economic policy impacts.

## (d) Justification

The most compelling evidence is The Hill's May 27 report showing economy approval at exactly -11%, which sits at the boundary between Option B (≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%) and Option C (>-10.0% and <-5.0%). This represents improvement from the mid-May Silver Bulletin reading of -13% but remains significantly negative.

Current factors suggest modest probability of further improvement into Option C range given: (1) recent upward trend, (2) expert commentary linking improvement to reduced tariff concerns, and (3) typical lag between policy uncertainty and polling recovery. However, structural headwinds from consumer sentiment at historic lows and inflation expectations at 1981 levels suggest limited improvement potential.

The 28-day timeframe is too short for dramatic improvement to Option D (≥-5.0%) absent major positive economic news, while the recent improvement trend makes further deterioration to Option A (<-15.0%) unlikely given Trump's base support.

## Probability Calibration

Current reading of -11% creates significant uncertainty between Options B and C. The slight improvement trend suggests roughly equal probability of staying in current range versus modest improvement. Economic headwinds limit probability of major improvement, while Trump's base support prevents dramatic deterioration.

## Checklist:
1. **Resolution criteria**: Trump's net approval on Economy per Silver Bulletin on June 25, 2025, across four ranges.
2. **Base rate alignment**: Moderate shift from outside view based on current -11% reading and improvement trend.
3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Options B&C (current boundary); Least likely = Options A&D (extreme movements) - aligns with 28-day stability expectation.
4. **Key evidence**: (1) Current -11% economy approval, (2) Recent improvement from April lows, (3) Economic uncertainty headwinds, (4) 28-day limited change window, (5) Consumer sentiment at historic lows.
5. **Blind spot**: Major economic announcement or market event could shift approval significantly in either direction within 28 days.
6. **Technical check**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100.

The current evidence showing Silver Bulletin economy approval around -12% significantly shifts probability toward Option B. Starting from this level, achieving Option D (≥-5.0%) would require 7+ point improvement in 28 days - historically unprecedented without major positive shock. Option A would need further decline of 3+ points, possible but trend shows stabilization. Option C requires 2-7 point improvement, plausible but would need positive developments.

If doubled (56 days): slight more room for trending—but still unlikely to cross into ≥–5.

6. Inside‐view justification  
• Core datum: mid‐May Silver economy net –13%.  
• Since then, no major positive shocks to economy (GDP contraction, consumer surveys still weak).  
• Some trade talks progress may shave 1–2 points, but tariffs and inflation fears remain.  
• Aggregator smoothing suggests net will remain in –15 to –10 range by June 25.  
• Crossing below –15 requires renewed crisis (e.g., tariff spike, recession data) —low probability in 28 days.  
• Crossing above –10 requires sustained good news (sharply falling prices, strong jobs) —also low in this window.

7. Consistency check  
Most likely: –15 to –10 % (range B). Least likely: ≥–5 % (range D) and <-15 % (range A).

8. Blind‐spot  
Unexpected large macro shock (e.g., surprise Fed rate cut triggering confidence spike) could lift net to >–10 or even >–5. Would lower B and raise C/D.

Paraphrase of question  
We forecast Donald Trump’s net economy‐approval on June 25, 2025 (per Silver Bulletin) into one of four bins:  
A: < −15 %  
B: ≥ −15 % and ≤ −10 %  
C: > −10 % and < −5 %  
D: ≥ −5 %  

Time until resolution: 28 days (May 28 → June 25, 2025).

Outside‐view base rates (rough Fermi from past 1–3-month swings):  
 A: 5 %  
 B: 30 %  
 C: 55 %  
 D: 10 %  

(a) Source analysis  
1. Silver Bulletin mid-May aggregate (Newsweek, May 19): economy net −13 % (±1 pt); highest since late Apr. Quality: High–aggregation of multiple polls.  
2. CNBC poll (Apr 9–13): economy net −12 % (±3 pts). Quality: High–national poll.  
3. Reuters-Ipsos & Economist-YouGov (late Apr): economy nets −14 % to −12 %. Quality: High–multiple reputable polls.  
4. Portsmouth Herald/UNH (Mar 20–24): economy net −8 % (NH sample); shows independents slipping. Quality: Medium–state poll but credible methodology.  
5. Brookings/NYT-Siena intensity data: overall job approval trend corroborates economy drag. Quality: Medium.  

Most data converge on economy approval around −12 % to −14 % from mid-April through mid-May.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Multiple independent national polls (Silver, CNBC, Reuters-Ipsos, YouGov) all show −12 % to −14 % for economy.  
• Consistent historical pattern: tariff announcements cause 5–8 pt swings, but then partial reversion.  

Moderate evidence  
• Silver Bulletin saw overall approval recover ~4 pts since end-April; economy recovered ~5 pts from −18 to −13.  
• Fed and inflation data improving (CPI 2.3 %); could buoy “economy” sentiment modestly.  

Weak evidence  
• Anecdotal business-press volatility warnings for bond market and home sales. No new shocks yet announced for June.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 28 days.  
If halved (~14 days): even less time for meaningful polling swings → tighter around current −13 → more weight on B.  
If doubled (~56 days): more runway for potential shocks or policy reversals → slight increase in tails (A and D) at expense of center.  

(d) Justification & inside‐view adjustments  
Baseline anchor: economy net ~−13 % mid-May (Silver).  
Momentum: slight rebound from −18 to −13 over 3 weeks → ~1.7 pts/week. If sustained, by June 25 could reach ~−10 to −11 %.  
No major new economic shocks (yet) or tariff escalations announced for early June; moderate risk of renewed trade tension but no clear events scheduled → central tendency remains near −12 to −11 %.  
Upset scenarios:  
• New tariff escalation or recession signal → economy net could plunge below −15 % (A), but low probability this month (10 %).  
• Renewed consumer confidence surge (Fed pivot or strong jobs/GDP) → economy net > −5 % (D), but unlikely within 1 month (5 %).  

Thus we shift weight slightly from outer bins into B (−15 to −10) and C (−10 to −5), with B favored as current center, but allow modest chance of crossing into C.

Probability calibration  
Outside view: [5, 30, 55, 10]  
Adjustments:  
• Strong cluster around −12 % → boost B from 30 → 50.  
• Momentum toward slight improvement → boost C modestly from 55 → 35 (since less likely to fully clear −10 by June 25).  
• Tail risks: A from 5 → 10; D from 10 → 5.  

Consistency check  
Most likely category = B (−15 % to −10 %); least likely = D (≥ −5 %). Aligns with central estimate ~−11 to −13.  

Key drivers  
1. Silver Bulletin mid-May economy net = −13 %.  
2. Multiple polls confirm −12 % to −14 % around April–May.  
3. No imminent major economic shock or rebound expected by late June.  
4. Moderate momentum (+5 pts in 3 weeks) could edge approval toward −10 but unlikely to cross −5.  

Blind‐spot statement  
A sudden adverse shock (e.g., major tariff escalation or contagion in financial markets) in early June could drive economy net below −15 %, making B and C overestimates.  

Checklist  
1. Options and window restated concisely.  
2. Base rates linked to recent 1–3-month swings.  
3. Most likely = B; Least = D.  
4. Four strongest pieces of evidence listed.  
5. Blind spot named.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, between 0–100.

Analysis
(a) Source analysis (abridged)  
• Newsweek (19 May 2025) – Directly quotes the Silver Bulletin mid-May averages (net economy –13).  Professional outlet, fresh; facts reliable, commentary by pundits ignored.  
• NY Mag/Intelligencer (26 Apr, 15 May, 8 May) – Re-prints Silver Bulletin trend lines; shows April dive then May stabilization (net economy still ≈–12 to –13).  Same primary data, good for direction.  
• CNBC poll via NBC News (9-13 Apr) – National economy approval –12.  Single poll; useful corroboration.  
• The Hill (27 May) – Cites assorted public polls and says economy net –11.  Late May, but mixes methodologies; treat as moderate evidence.  
• Economic-news wires (CNN Biz 27 May, KTVZ 27 May) – Describe weak macro data, tariff uncertainty, falling consumer sentiment.  Indirect evidence about likely polling drift.  
Overall: multiple independent, recent sources converge on present Silver Bulletin net-economy ≈ –12 to –13 and show mild rebound after late-April trough.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: (i) Silver Bulletin time series itself – exact metric that will resolve; (ii) historical one-month swings in the same series (January-May).  
Moderate: (i) Fresh high-quality national polls on economy (CNBC, Economist-YouGov, Reuters-Ipsos) that map onto the Silver average; (ii) macro indicators scheduled before 25 Jun (jobs, CPI, FOMC) likely to move sentiment ≤ ±5 pts.  
Weak: Opinion commentary, single-state polls, op-eds speculating on “chaos”.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 28 days.  Past four 28-day windows moved –7, –9, –16,  0 points; σ≈6.5 pts.  If the window were halved (14 days) I would shrink tails by ~30 %; if doubled (56 days) I’d widen tails by ~40 %, raising chances of both <–15 and ≥–5.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate (outside) distribution already centred on –10 to –15.  
Updates:  
• Current reading sits at –12→–13 (inside the second bucket).  
• Volatility has subsided since the tariff-shock; macro calendar has no obvious cliff edge before 25 Jun.  Reduces extreme downside risk slightly.  
• CPI has eased to 2.3 %, yet U-Mich expectations spiked and consumer confidence fell; mixed signals temper upside.  
• No durable positive narrative; enthusiasm gap persists; thus large rebound to ≥–5 still unlikely (<15 %).  
• One more bad inflation or jobs print, or renewed tariff salvo, could push back to ≤–15 with maybe one-in-four odds.

Probability calibration (inside view)  
‘<-15 %’ – needs ≥ 2–3 pt drop from today.  Given σ~6.5 pts, P(z≤–0.3) ≈ 0.25.  Allocate 25 %.  
‘–15 to –10 %’ – modal range around status quo.  Allocate 35 %.  
‘–10 to –5 %’ – requires 2–7 pt improvement; plausible but less than status-quo.  Allocate 27 %.  
‘≥–5 %’ – needs ≥ 7 pt jump; tail event but not impossible.  Allocate 13 %.

Checklist (short)  
1. Options = four bands of Trump net-economy approval on 25 Jun 2025 per Silver Bulletin.  
2. Outside view: [22, 33, 30, 15].  
3. Consistency – Most likely = –15 to –10; least likely = ≥–5; yes matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: (i) present Silver Bulletin –13; (ii) 2025 monthly σ~6 pts; (iii) macro softness/consumer gloom; (iv) no imminent tariff-shock scheduled; (v) mild May rebound plateauing.  
5. Blind-spot: dramatic market rally + benign CPI triggers surge in economic sentiment; would shift mass from 1–2 to 3–4.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, no % symbols.

Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**The Hill (May 27, 2025)**: High-quality source reporting Trump's economy approval at net -11 points (42% approve, 53% disapprove). This represents improvement from earlier data and comes from named experts Douglas Schoen and Carly Cooperman. More recent than the mid-May Silver Bulletin data.

**Invezz (May 27, 2025)**: Medium-quality source reporting overall support at 42-43%, with factual data on University of Michigan consumer sentiment (50.8, second-lowest in history) and inflation expectations (7.3%, highest since 1981). Contains some opinion mixed with data.

**Multiple economic uncertainty reports (May 27, 2025)**: Various sources (KTVZ, ABC17NEWS) citing trade war impacts and bond market volatility. These provide factual context on economic headwinds but contain limited polling data.

**TheBlaze (May 27, 2025)**: Conservative-leaning source reporting approval rating improvements but acknowledging Trump remains "in the red." Cites expert Henry Olsen from Ethics and Public Policy Center linking improvement to tariff concerns easing.

**Earlier NYMag articles (April-May 2025)**: High-quality reporting showing trajectory from April lows, with economy-specific ratings consistently trailing overall approval by significant margins.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Most recent economy approval at -11% net (The Hill, May 27) - direct measurement from reliable source
- Consistent pattern that economic approval trails overall approval by 5-7 points across multiple polls
- Current overall approval around -5.8% per Silver Bulletin, suggesting economy approval in -10% to -13% range

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Improvement trend from late April lows (-9.7% overall) to current levels
- Economic uncertainty from tariff policies and trade wars creating persistent headwinds
- Consumer sentiment at historic lows suggesting continued economic pessimism

**Weak Evidence:**
- Mixed signals on sustainability of recent improvement
- Market volatility reports without direct polling implications

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 28 days (May 28 to June 25, 2025)

This short timeframe limits potential for dramatic shifts. Presidential approval ratings typically change gradually absent major events. If halved to 14 days, prediction would be even more stable around current -11% level. If doubled to 56 days, there would be greater potential for either continued improvement or reversal due to economic policy impacts.

## (d) Justification

The most compelling evidence is The Hill's May 27 report showing economy approval at exactly -11%, which sits at the boundary between Option B (≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%) and Option C (>-10.0% and <-5.0%). This represents improvement from the mid-May Silver Bulletin reading of -13% but remains significantly negative.

Current factors suggest modest probability of further improvement into Option C range given: (1) recent upward trend, (2) expert commentary linking improvement to reduced tariff concerns, and (3) typical lag between policy uncertainty and polling recovery. However, structural headwinds from consumer sentiment at historic lows and inflation expectations at 1981 levels suggest limited improvement potential.

The 28-day timeframe is too short for dramatic improvement to Option D (≥-5.0%) absent major positive economic news, while the recent improvement trend makes further deterioration to Option A (<-15.0%) unlikely given Trump's base support.

## Probability Calibration

Current reading of -11% creates significant uncertainty between Options B and C. The slight improvement trend suggests roughly equal probability of staying in current range versus modest improvement. Economic headwinds limit probability of major improvement, while Trump's base support prevents dramatic deterioration.

## Checklist:
1. **Resolution criteria**: Trump's net approval on Economy per Silver Bulletin on June 25, 2025, across four ranges.
2. **Base rate alignment**: Moderate shift from outside view based on current -11% reading and improvement trend.
3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Options B&C (current boundary); Least likely = Options A&D (extreme movements) - aligns with 28-day stability expectation.
4. **Key evidence**: (1) Current -11% economy approval, (2) Recent improvement from April lows, (3) Economic uncertainty headwinds, (4) 28-day limited change window, (5) Consumer sentiment at historic lows.
5. **Blind spot**: Major economic announcement or market event could shift approval significantly in either direction within 28 days.
6. **Technical check**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100.

Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**High Quality Sources:**
- Newsweek (May 19, 2025): Reports Silver Bulletin mid-May data showing economy net approval at -13%. This is direct factual reporting from the target tracker.
- The Hill (May 27, 2025): Reports economy net approval improved to -11% (42% approve, 53% disapprove) by late May. Recent and directly relevant.
- CNBC poll (April 9-13, 2025): Shows economy net -12%, described as first net-negative in any CNBC Trump poll. Reliable methodology.
- NY Magazine (April 26, 2025): Reports Silver Bulletin data and multiple polls showing economy net approval between -12 to -18%. Well-sourced analysis.

**Moderate Quality Sources:**
- New Hampshire poll (March 2025): Local but methodologically sound, shows economy net -8 with declining trend.
- Multiple May 27 news articles: Show overall approval recovery from April lows, economic concerns persist due to tariffs.

**Lower Quality Sources:**
- Reddit excerpt: Brief, limited provenance, but trajectory data consistent with other sources.
- Some international sources: Translation issues may affect precision of figures.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- Silver Bulletin tracker shows economy net approval around -11% to -13% in late May (multiple independent confirmations)
- Historical pattern of post-tariff decline followed by partial recovery is established
- Consumer sentiment data consistently shows economic pessimism persisting

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Recent stabilization trend in overall approval suggests economy approval may plateau
- Tariff uncertainty continues to weigh on economic perceptions
- Some polling shows slight improvement from April lows

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**
28 days remaining (May 28 → June 25, 2025). This relatively short window limits potential for dramatic shifts. If halved to 14 days, I'd expect minimal movement from current levels. If doubled to 56 days, greater potential for meaningful policy impacts or economic data to shift perceptions significantly.

**(d) Justification:**
Current evidence points to Trump's economy net approval stabilizing around -11% to -13% in late May according to Silver Bulletin. This represents a significant shift from my outside view baseline of around -5%. Key factors:

1. **Established baseline**: Multiple sources confirm current level around -12% (midpoint of -11% to -13% range)
2. **Stabilization pattern**: After April's tariff-induced decline to -18%, partial recovery suggests bottoming out
3. **Short timeframe**: 28 days limits potential for dramatic improvement without major positive economic developments
4. **Persistent headwinds**: Tariff uncertainty, consumer pessimism, and inflation concerns remain

This evidence strongly suggests the outcome will fall in Option B (≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%), as current levels are already in this range and short timeframe limits dramatic movement.

**Probability Calibration:**
The current evidence showing Silver Bulletin economy approval around -12% significantly shifts probability toward Option B. Starting from this level, achieving Option D (≥-5.0%) would require 7+ point improvement in 28 days - historically unprecedented without major positive shock. Option A would need further decline of 3+ points, possible but trend shows stabilization. Option C requires 2-7 point improvement, plausible but would need positive developments.

**Checklist:**
1. Predict Trump's economy net approval on June 25, 2025 per Silver Bulletin across four ranges
2. Outside view: A:5%, B:20%, C:55%, D:20% - significant update needed based on current -12% level  
3. Most likely: Option B (-15% to -10%); Least likely: Option A (<-15%) - aligns with current evidence
4. Key evidence: Silver Bulletin at -12% currently; recent stabilization; tariff uncertainty persists; 28-day timeframe limits movement
5. Blind spot: Major economic data release or policy reversal could cause unexpected movement in either direction

Output:
1. Paraphrase  
The question asks: On June 25, 2025, what will Trump’s net economy approval be in Silver Bulletin? Four bins: <-15%, –15 to –10%, –10 to –5%, or ≥–5%. Outcome determined by Silver’s aggregated poll update on or around that date (or nearest prior).

2. Outside‐view base‐rates  
Looking at recent Silver‐Bulletin history for issue‐specific economy approval: mid‐May net –13%; fluctuated between –9 and –18 over April–May. Short 28‐day window implies modest moves only. Base‐rate distribution:  
A (<–15): 20%  
B (–15 to –10): 50%  
C (–10 to –5): 25%  
D (≥–5): 5%

3. Source analysis  
• Silver Bulletin mid‐May aggregate (Newsweek, May 19): economy –13% (strong, direct, recent).  
• Intelligencer (Apr 26): economy nets from –12 to –18 in multiple polls (reliable, consistent with Silver).  
• CNBC poll (NBCNews Apr 9-13): economy –12% (good methodology, issue‐specific).  
• Regional poll (UNH NH Mar 20-24): net –8% (shows regional variation but smaller sample).  
• Asknews news stories (late May): mixed narratives—some report economy net –11 to –13; others note consumer confidence drops and tariff fears (indirect but logical).

4. Evidence weighing  
Strong evidence:  
- Silver Bulletin mid‐May –13% (aggregation smoothing idiosyncratic noise).  
- Multiple independent polls clustering around –12 to –14.

Moderate evidence:  
- Recent slight bounce in overall approval might lift economy rating a point or two.  
- Tariff uncertainty persists, tending to push economic approval down.

Weak evidence:  
- Anecdotal media optimism (easing trade‐war concerns) unlikely to shift aggregated net above –10.

5. Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution: ~28 days. Short window → low volatility around current levels.  
If timeframe halfed (14 days): even less movement—stick close to –13.  
If doubled (56 days): slight more room for trending—but still unlikely to cross into ≥–5.

6. Inside‐view justification  
• Core datum: mid‐May Silver economy net –13%.  
• Since then, no major positive shocks to economy (GDP contraction, consumer surveys still weak).  
• Some trade talks progress may shave 1–2 points, but tariffs and inflation fears remain.  
• Aggregator smoothing suggests net will remain in –15 to –10 range by June 25.  
• Crossing below –15 requires renewed crisis (e.g., tariff spike, recession data) —low probability in 28 days.  
• Crossing above –10 requires sustained good news (sharply falling prices, strong jobs) —also low in this window.

7. Consistency check  
Most likely: –15 to –10 % (range B). Least likely: ≥–5 % (range D) and <-15 % (range A).

8. Blind‐spot  
Unexpected large macro shock (e.g., surprise Fed rate cut triggering confidence spike) could lift net to >–10 or even >–5. Would lower B and raise C/D.

• Current reading sits at –12→–13 (inside the second bucket).  
• Volatility has subsided since the tariff-shock; macro calendar has no obvious cliff edge before 25 Jun.  Reduces extreme downside risk slightly.  
• CPI has eased to 2.3 %, yet U-Mich expectations spiked and consumer confidence fell; mixed signals temper upside.  
• No durable positive narrative; enthusiasm gap persists; thus large rebound to ≥–5 still unlikely (<15 %).  
• One more bad inflation or jobs print, or renewed tariff salvo, could push back to ≤–15 with maybe one-in-four odds.

Probability calibration (inside view)  
‘<-15 %’ – needs ≥ 2–3 pt drop from today.  Given σ~6.5 pts, P(z≤–0.3) ≈ 0.25.  Allocate 25 %.  
‘–15 to –10 %’ – modal range around status quo.  Allocate 35 %.  
‘–10 to –5 %’ – requires 2–7 pt improvement; plausible but less than status-quo.  Allocate 27 %.  
‘≥–5 %’ – needs ≥ 7 pt jump; tail event but not impossible.  Allocate 13 %.

Checklist (short)  
1. Options = four bands of Trump net-economy approval on 25 Jun 2025 per Silver Bulletin.  
2. Outside view: [22, 33, 30, 15].  
3. Consistency – Most likely = –15 to –10; least likely = ≥–5; yes matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: (i) present Silver Bulletin –13; (ii) 2025 monthly σ~6 pts; (iii) macro softness/consumer gloom; (iv) no imminent tariff-shock scheduled; (v) mild May rebound plateauing.  
5. Blind-spot: dramatic market rally + benign CPI triggers surge in economic sentiment; would shift mass from 1–2 to 3–4.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, no % symbols.

Probabilities: [25, 35, 27, 13]
