Analysis:
The core of this forecast is estimating the base‐rate probability that the S&P 500 closes higher in May than it did at the end of April. Historically, U.S. equities have posted positive returns in roughly 60–65 percent of all months, with some seasonal variations—for example, “Sell in May and go away” seasonality suggests May can be slightly weaker than average, but empirical data vary year to year. To ground the out-view, I need (a) a historical distribution of monthly returns, especially for May, and (b) evidence on how May performs following Fed rate-hike or hold cycles and in the early stages of Q2 earnings. Once the base‐rate is clear, I can layer in the current macro backdrop: April 2025’s close, recent Fed guidance, inflation trends, earnings expectations, geopolitical risks, and positioning to produce the inside view.

Analysis:
To form an inside‐view forecast for whether the S&P 500 will close higher at the end of May 2025 than April 2025, we need:
1. A base‐rate from history: frequency and average return of the S&P 500 in May, under various macro regimes.
2. Current Fed policy stance and expected rate moves—there’s a Fed meeting on May 1 that could set the tone.
3. Key economic releases in May (inflation, jobs, PMI) and their likely direction.
4. Corporate earnings season outcomes for Q1 and revisions to forward guidance.
5. Market and analyst sentiment: positioning, target prices, and risk‐off/risk‐on indicators.
6. Any geopolitical or fiscal policy developments (e.g., debt ceiling, trade).
We’ll first establish the historical tendency for May gains, then use the latest central bank signals, economic data forecasts, and earnings outlook to adjust our base‐rate up or down.

Summary of “S&P 500 Average Returns and Historical Performance” (Investopedia)

Source disclaimer: All data and commentary below are drawn from the Investopedia article, which cites Trading View for index values and presents general advice from financial advisors.

1. Key Facts & Statistics
• Index definition: The S&P 500 is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading U.S. publicly traded companies. It traces formally to 1957, with roots back to the 1920s.  
• Long-term returns (1957–2024):  
 – Nominal average annual return: 10.13%  
 – Real (inflation-adjusted) average annual return: 6.37%  
• Longer history (1928–Nov 2024):  
 – Nominal annualized return: 10.06%  
 – Real annualized return: 6.78%  
• Market concentration (mid-2024):  
 – Top 10 stocks = 33% of index value (versus 27% at 2000 peak)  
 – “Magnificent Seven” firms (Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Tesla) = ~33% of market cap; contributed nearly 50% of returns  
 – NVIDIA alone accounted for ~24% of 2024’s S&P 500 gains  
• Historical index levels & drawdowns:  
 – Postwar boom (1957–1969): rose to ~800  
 – Stagflation (1970–1981): fell below 360  
 – Internet boom & bust (1990–2002): surge in late 1990s, collapse in early 2000s  
 – Financial Crisis (Oct 2007–Mar 2009): –57% peak-to-trough  
 – Long bull run (2009–2020): +330% over 10 years  
 – COVID-19 shock (Feb–Mar 2020): –15% drop, full recovery by 2021 → new highs  
 – 2022: heightened volatility; 2023–2024: resumed record highs  

2. Inflation’s Impact  
• Headline vs. real returns: Over the last century, a 10.06% nominal return translates to ~6.78% after inflation, illustrating the erosion of purchasing power.

3. Market Timing & Investment Strategy  
• Timing risk: Returns vary widely depending on entry/exit points (e.g., buying during 2020 or 2022 lows vs. highs).  
• Dollar-cost averaging (DCA):  
 – Advice from “many financial advisors” (unnamed): investing fixed amounts periodically can mitigate volatility and reduce the risk of poor timing.  
 – Example chart (2004–present) shows substantial growth despite crises when using DCA.  

4. Concentration Risks  
• Diversification concern: Although the S&P 500 is marketed as broad diversification, a small number of large-cap tech firms now disproportionately drive returns.  
• Sector evolution:  
 – 1957: dominated by industrials and energy  
 – 1990s: financials and consumer firms led  
 – 2024: technology firms are most prominent

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the Visual Capitalist article “Charted: Average S&P 500 Return by Month Since 1950” (Marcus Lu, March 10 2025). No outside data or forecasts are included.

Key Facts and Statistics  
• Data source: YCharts (via Bilello Blog).  
• Period covered: January 1950 – December 2024 (monthly total returns for the S&P 500).  
• Average monthly returns since 1950 vs. actual 2024 returns:

  Month | Avg. Return (%) | 2024 Return (%)  
  ————|———————|———————  
  January   | 1.07  | 1.59  
  February  | –0.01 | 5.17

  October   | 0.91  | –0.99  
  November  | 1.82  | 5.73  
  December  | 1.49  | –2.50  

Key Observations  
• Seasonal Pattern:  
  – Months following April (May, June, August, September) have historically weak average returns (May’s average is just 0.30%), with the exception of July.  
  – Strongest historical months: November (1.82%), December (1.49%), April (1.46%), March (1.13%), January (1.07%).  
  – Weakest historical months: September (–0.72%), February and August (both –0.01%).  

• 2024 Deviations:  
  – Despite May’s low historical average, May 2024 returned 4.80%.  
  – April 2024 posted –4.16%, contrasting its long‐term +1.46% average.  
  – Highlights that single years can diverge sharply from multi-decade averages.

Notable Market Sayings (as discussed in the article)  
1. “Sell in May and go away” – suggests underperformance in summer months; data shows some support but with exceptions.  
2. “Time in the market beats timing the market” – underscores a buy-and-hold philosophy; see Visual Capitalist’s related graphic “The Cost of Timing the Market.”

Cautionary Note  
Historical averages reveal seasonal tendencies but do not guarantee future performance. Unique economic conditions or shocks can produce significant year-to-year variation.

Article: “S&P 500’s era of hot returns is over, Goldman says”  
Source: Axios, October 22, 2024; Author: Neil Irwin

Key facts and statistics  
• Past 15 years: S&P 500 averaged 13% annual returns (with dividends reinvested).  
• Goldman Sachs projects ~3% annual returns for the S&P 500 over the coming decade.  
• Goldman assigns a 72% probability the S&P 500 will underperform U.S. Treasury securities and a 33% chance it will deliver returns below inflation through 2034.  
• Mega-caps (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, plus Berkshire Hathaway and Tesla) now account for roughly one-third of the S&P 500’s market-cap weighting.  

Model inputs and rationale  
• Goldman’s forecast is driven by normalized price-to-earnings ratios and prevailing interest rates, and by concerns over extreme index concentration.  
• Historical parallels:  
 – 1960s–’70s “Nifty Fifty” (IBM, Eastman Kodak, Xerox) led to a lost decade of returns.  
 – Late-1990s tech boom (Microsoft, GE, Cisco, Intel) preceded weak returns in the 2000s.  

Expert opinions  
• David Kostin (Goldman’s chief U.S. equity strategist) and colleagues:  
  “Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time… As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate.”  
• Vanguard: currently forecasts 3%–5% annual returns for large-cap U.S. stocks over the next decade. It expects higher returns from value stocks, small caps, REITs, and international equities.  

Secondary views  
• Some analysts argue that the AI-driven winners of the past decade could sustain outsized growth if winner-take-all dynamics and massive capital spending persist.  

Bottom line from the article  
• Goldman (and broadly similar forecasters) believe the S&P 500’s run of double-digit gains is likely over, and that more diversified strategies (by size, style, or region) may outperform in the decade ahead.

Query: Provide a detailed breakdown of historical S&P 500 monthly returns over the past 50 years, focusing on how often the index rose in May and the average return magnitude. Include seasonality patterns and frequency of positive May performance. Summarize how May has historically performed following Federal Reserve rate hikes or cuts. Provide key macro factors driving May returns.
# Historical Analysis of S&P 500 May Returns: Seasonal Patterns, Federal Reserve Policy Impacts, and Macroeconomic Drivers  

The S&P 500 has exhibited distinct seasonal tendencies over its history, with May often serving as a transitional month between the historically strong November-April period and the weaker May-October interval. This analysis examines May's performance over the past 50 years, focusing on return magnitude, frequency of positive outcomes, Federal Reserve policy correlations, and macroeconomic catalysts. The data reveals that while May has generated marginally positive average returns, its performance is highly sensitive to monetary policy shifts and cyclical economic conditions.  

---

## Historical May Performance (1975–2024)  

### Average Return Magnitude  
From 1975 to 2024, the S&P 500 delivered an average price return of **0.62%** in May, slightly below the 1.02% average for all months[6][16]. However, volatility has been notable:  
- **Best May**: +8.47% (1990)  
- **Worst May**: -8.80% (2022)[1][6]  
The 0.62% average masks significant dispersion, with 12 instances of returns exceeding ±5% since 1975.  

### Frequency of Positive Returns  
May closed higher in **62% of years** (31 of 50), outperforming September (48% positive) but lagging December (78%)[6][16]. Recent trends show strengthening performance:  
- **2000–2024**: 68% positive rate (17 of 25)  
- **2015–2024**: 70% positive rate (7 of 10)[1][6]  

This improvement coincides with the Federal Reserve's increased transparency in monetary policy communication since 2012[12].  

---

## Seasonal Patterns and the "Sell in May" Myth  

### Summer Underperformance Context  
The adage "Sell in May and go away" references the index's historical **November-April vs. May-October performance**:  
| Period          | Average Return | Positive Frequency |  
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|  
| November-April  | 6.3%           | 78%                |  
| May-October     | 3.0%           | 65%                |[2][16]  

While May-October underperforms, recent data complicates this narrative:  
- **2020**: +24% May-Oct return vs. -7.7% Nov-Apr[2]  
- **2023**: +5% May-Oct vs. +20% Nov-Apr[3]  

May itself has shown no consistent directional bias, serving as a volatility bridge between earnings seasons[7].  

---

## Federal Reserve Policy Impacts  

### Rate Hike/Cut Cycles  
May performance demonstrates asymmetry depending on Fed policy direction:  

#### Rate Hike Environments  
In months following Fed rate hikes (1975–2024):  
- **Next May average return**: -1.12%  
- **Positive frequency**: 54%  
- Example: May 2022 (-8.80%) followed March 2022's first hike since 2018[1][12]  

#### Rate Cut Environments  
Following initial Fed cuts (1975–2024):  
- **Next May average return**: +3.08%  
- **Positive frequency**: 72%  
- Example: May 2024 (+4.80%) after September 2023 cut expectations solidified[4][9]  

This pattern reflects market anticipations of easing cycles boosting risk assets. However, cuts signaling economic weakness (e.g., May 2001: -0.9% post-January 2001 emergency cut) underperform those addressing neutral policy adjustments[8][11].  

---

## Macroeconomic Drivers of May Returns  

### Key Influencing Factors  
1. **Earnings Season**: 85% of S&P 500 firms report Q1 results by late April, creating May momentum gaps. Strong beats (≥5% above estimates) correlate with +2.1% avg May return vs. -1.4% for misses[7].  
2. **Federal Reserve Meetings**: May FOMC meetings (12 occurrences since 2000) preceded 1.8% avg 30-day returns when pausing vs. -0.6% when hiking[9][12].  
3. **CPI Releases**: May reactions to April CPI data show:  
   - Below-forecast CPI: +2.3% avg May return  
   - Above-forecast CPI: -1.9% avg[4][9]  
4. **Geopolitical Events**: May drawdowns exceed 5% during Middle East crises (1990: -6.2%) and trade wars (2019: -6.6%)[1][6].  

---

## Conclusion  

May's historical profile reveals a month of moderated returns (+0.62% avg) with elevated policy sensitivity. While 62% of Mays closed positive, outcomes hinge critically on Federal Reserve posture, with post-cut environments generating 3.08% average gains vs. post-hike declines. Recent decades show improved performance (70% positive since 2015), likely reflecting adaptive market structures and the Fed's data-dependent framework. Investors should monitor April CPI prints and Q1 earnings surprises as leading May indicators, while recognizing that calendar-based strategies overlook现代市场动力学.

Disclaimer: The article text appears to be truncated just as Goldman Sachs outlines three conditions for a market recovery.

1. Facts & Statistics  
• Goldman Sachs Research cut its forecast for the S&P 500 Index to reflect slower GDP growth, higher tariffs, and increased uncertainty.  
• Real U.S. GDP growth forecast lowered from 2.2% to 1.7% year-on-year by end of fiscal 2025.  
• U.S. average tariff rate now projected to rise by about 10 percentage points to 13%.  
• Rule of thumb: every 5-point tariff increase reduces S&P 500 EPS by roughly 1–2%.  
• Over 12 post-WWII U.S. recessions, the S&P 500‘s median peak-to-trough decline was 24%, with earnings dropping 13%.  
• Over the last 40 years, the S&P 500 has seen a median annual drawdown of 10%—matching this year’s early-2025 pullback.  
• Goldman Sachs economists assign a 20% probability of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months (consensus 25%; long-term average 15%).  
• More than half of the S&P 500’s 10% drop from its February all-time high came from the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks.  
• Hedge-fund–favorite stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 by their widest margin in five years, reflecting a major positioning unwind.

2. Opinions from Reliable, Named Sources  
• David Kostin, Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs Research:  
  – “The headwinds to equity valuations from a spike in uncertainty are typically relatively short-lived.”  
  – “An outlook for slower growth suggests lower valuations on a more sustained basis.”  
  – “The key market risk going forward is a major further deterioration in the economic outlook.”  
• Portfolio managers are increasingly asking about recession implications, given historical median declines.

Article title: A Year of Divergence: The Market and Economic Outlook for 2025  
Source: J.P. Morgan Research  
Date: December 17, 2024  
Format: Podcast transcript hosted by Fabio Bassi, Head of Cross-Asset Strategy

Key themes  
• Divergence across regions and asset classes driven by unsynchronized business cycles, policy shifts and geopolitical uncertainty.  
• Need for flexibility in positioning, as global outlook becomes more complex.

Hussein Malik, Head of Global Research  
• 2024 focus: inflation, central-bank responses, global elections.  
• 2025 focus: U.S. policy changes (trade, immigration, fiscal, regulatory) will reverberate globally.  
• Less‐synchronized business cycles and diverse central-bank paths heighten uncertainty.

Bruce Kasman, Chief Economist  
• Interest-rate divergence: Western Europe rates may fall below 2% in 2025; U.S. rates likely to remain around 4%.  
• J.P. Morgan vs. consensus: While many forecasters expected synchronized disinflation and substantial rate cuts, J.P. Morgan maintains a “high-for-long” rates view.  
• U.S. election impact:  
  – Anticipated Trump administration trade measures could raise global inflation and constrain central-bank easing.  
  – U.S. may benefit from fiscal and regulatory changes, but the rest of the world could face both direct trade shocks and broader sentiment shocks if policies become more extreme.  
  – Escalation of tariffs or geopolitical conflict risks undermining global expansion.

Meera Chandan, FX Strategist (excerpt)  
• “I think the U.S. election is going to be one of the big drivers for FX next year.”

Luis Oganes, Emerging Markets Strategist (excerpt)  
• “Inflation has been declining in emerging markets, which is good news.”

Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, Head of Global Market Strategy (partial)  
• Sees 2025 equity markets characterized by “dispersion,” reflecting both top-down forces (unsynchronized cycles) and bottom-up factors (details not fully available).

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED Data (St. Louis Fed)**:
- Highly reliable primary data showing recent S&P 500 values

- Pure factual data with no opinions

**Macrotrends Historical Chart**:
- Comprehensive historical data back to 1927
- Shows 2025 YTD performance is down 6.06% through April 25
- 2024 showed strong performance (+23.31%)
- Factual historical data with no opinions

**S&P Global Website**:
- Primary source with institutional information about the index
- Limited relevant information for this specific forecasting question
- No opinions relevant to our analysis

**Investopedia (Average Returns)**:
- Educational resource with long-term S&P 500 performance data
- Reports 10.13% nominal average annual return since 1957
- Contains general investment advice from unnamed financial advisors (which I'll discount)
- Notes current high market concentration in tech stocks (33% in top 10 stocks)

**Visual Capitalist (Monthly Returns)**:
- Data visualization showing average monthly S&P 500 returns since 1950
- Key finding: May has averaged 0.30% return historically
- May 2024 performed exceptionally well (+4.80%) despite historical averages
- Notes the "Sell in May" pattern but shows its inconsistency
- Primarily factual with minimal interpretation

**Axios (Goldman Sachs Forecast)**:
- Reports Goldman Sachs' bearish 10-year S&P 500 outlook (~3% annual returns)
- Contains expert opinions from identified sources (Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist)
- Highlights concerns over market concentration
- More relevant for long-term outlook than May 2025 specifically

**Perplexity Report**:
- Comprehensive analysis of historical May performance patterns
- Key statistics: 0.62% average May return (1975-2024); 62% frequency of positive Mays
- Shows May performance correlation with Fed policy (better after rate cuts)
- Notes increasing frequency of positive Mays in recent periods (70% since 2015)
- Most directly relevant source for this question

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several potential reference classes emerge:

1. **Historical May Performance (All Years)**: 62% positive frequency with 0.30-0.62% average return
   
2. **Recent May Performance**: 68% positive (2000-2024); 70% positive (2015-2024)
   
3. **Post-Fed Policy May Performance**: 72% positive after rate cuts; 54% positive after rate hikes
   
4. **May Performance in Down Years**: Relevant given 2025's YTD performance (-6.06% through April)

The most suitable reference class is **Historical May Performance** with adjustment for recency, as it provides the largest sample while the increased frequency of positive Mays in recent decades suggests potential structural changes in market behavior.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction covers exactly one month (May 2025), which begins in 2 days from today (April 29, 2025).

Key timeframe observations:
- May has historically been the beginning of the weaker half of the year ("Sell in May")
- However, May itself has been positive 62% of the time over 50 years
- The S&P 500 has shown strong momentum in late April 2025, rising ~4.6% in the past week
- May comes during the post-earnings announcement period for Q1 results
- The final benchmark will be the comparison between April 30, 2025 close and May 31, 2025 close

## (d) Justification

Several factors inform my outside view prediction:

1. **Base Rate**: The 62% historical frequency of positive Mays provides a solid foundation.

2. **Recent Momentum**: The S&P 500's strong performance in late April 2025 (+4.6% in the final week) could carry forward into early May.

3. **Improving May Track Record**: The increasing frequency of positive Mays in recent decades (70% since 2015) suggests the "Sell in May" effect may be weakening.

4. **Mean Reversion Potential**: With the S&P 500 down 6.06% YTD in 2025 (through April), there may be potential for a rebound effect.

5. **Post-Earnings Impact**: According to the Perplexity report, Q1 earnings beats correlate with positive May returns, though we don't have specific Q1 2025 earnings data.

6. **Uncertainty Factors**: Without specific information about the current Fed policy stance or inflation trends, there remains significant uncertainty, as these factors have historically influenced May performance.

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I start with the historical base rate of 62% positive Mays over the past 50 years. However, several factors suggest potential adjustments:

- More recent data shows improved May performance: 68% positive (2000-2024) and 70% positive (2015-2024)
- The strong upward momentum in late April 2025 suggests continued buying pressure may extend into early May
- The negative YTD performance (-6.06% through April) creates conditions for potential mean reversion
- Without specific Fed policy information, I cannot confidently apply the post-rate cut/hike May performance patterns

Balancing these factors, I see justification for a probability slightly higher than the 50-year historical average (62%) but below the most recent decade's performance (70%). The recent strong momentum and potential mean reversion slightly outweigh the uncertainty around Fed policy and broader economic conditions.

65%

   - **Opinions:** No direct opinions, though some interpretive analysis of patterns.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

**Potential reference classes:**

1. **All historical May returns (1950-2024)** - Base rate of monthly performance regardless of context.
   - Advantages: Large sample size (75 years); directly addresses the question.
   - Disadvantages: May miss important conditional factors.

2. **May returns following specific Fed policy environments**
   - Advantages: Captures important macroeconomic context that influences market behavior.
   - Disadvantages: Limited information about current Fed stance in April 2025.

3. **May returns in recent decade (2015-2024)**
   - Advantages: Reflects modern market structure and behavior.
   - Disadvantages: Smaller sample size; potential recency bias.

**Most suitable reference class:** Historical May returns (1950-2024) provide the most robust primary reference class, with recent decade performance as a supporting reference class. The Fed policy environment would be valuable but we lack certainty about the current stance.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

Our prediction timeframe is one month (end of April 2025 to end of May 2025). Key historical patterns:

- May has historically produced slightly positive returns: 0.30% average since 1950 (Visual Capitalist), 0.62% average from 1975-2024 (Perplexity)
- Frequency of positive May returns: 62% (1975-2024), improving to 70% in recent decade (2015-2024)
- May underperforms compared to strongest months (November, December, April) but outperforms September (historically worst month)
- The "Sell in May" adage refers to May-October underperforming November-April, but May itself has been slightly positive on average

## (d) Justification:

Several factors support a modestly optimistic outlook for May 2025:

1. **Historical frequency favors positive returns:** May has closed positive in 62% of years since 1975, with this rate improving to 70% in the past decade (2015-2024).

2. **Current momentum:** The S&P 500 has been trending upward in late April 2025, potentially carrying positive momentum into May.

3. **Seasonal improvements:** While May historically underperforms other months, its positive frequency has improved in recent decades, possibly reflecting changes in market structure or investor behavior.

4. **Market resilience:** Despite YTD negative performance in 2025 (-6.06% through April 25), markets have demonstrated resilience, with strong performance in prior years (2023: +24.23%, 2024: +23.31%).

Counterbalancing factors include:

1. **Long-term projection concerns:** Goldman Sachs and Vanguard project lower annual returns (3-5%) for the coming decade, suggesting potential moderation in monthly returns.

2. **Market concentration risks:** With approximately one-third of the index concentrated in mega-cap stocks, performance could be vulnerable to sector-specific shocks.

3. **Historical May modesty:** May's historical average return (0.30-0.62%) is positive but modest, suggesting limited upside potential.

## Outside view calibration:

I'll calibrate my prediction using the historical frequency of positive May returns:
- 62% positive Mays from 1975-2024 (long-term base rate)
- 70% positive Mays from 2015-2024 (recent performance)

These percentages represent direct measurements of how often the S&P 500 has risen in May over extended periods. While I could give more weight to recent performance (70%), I should be cautious about recency bias. 

The average return figures (0.30% according to Visual Capitalist, 0.62% according to Perplexity) align with the frequency data showing May is more often positive than negative.

Without specific information about the current Fed policy environment in April 2025, I cannot confidently apply the conditional probabilities from the Perplexity report (72% following cuts vs. 54% following hikes). However, the general range (54-72%) supports my baseline estimate.

Given this evidence, and considering both long-term patterns and more recent performance, a reasonable probability estimate would be 65%.

## Outside View Prediction:
65%

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED (S&P 500 daily closes): High-quality, direct historical data from S&P Dow Jones Indices via the Federal Reserve. Purely factual.  
2. Macrotrends (Inflation-adjusted month-end closes): Reliable for long-run, CPI-adjusted context. Factual; no forecasts.  
3. S&P DJI overview page: High credibility on index methodology and use cases. Mostly descriptive; no forward-looking views.  
4. Investopedia (“Average Returns”): Aggregates long-term statistics (nominal/real returns, sector concentration). Facts drawn from recognized sources; general investment advice labeled as opinion from “unnamed advisors.” Treat average return figures as solid; anecdotal advice with caution.  
5. Visual Capitalist (“Average Return by Month”): Well-documented seasonal data since 1950. Factual monthly averages; no expert forecasts.  
6. Axios (“Goldman Sachs forecasts”): Expert opinion from Goldman strategists. Clearly flagged as forecast/opinion based on P/E and rate assumptions. Use the probability estimates (e.g., 72% underperformance vs. Treasuries) with moderate weight.  
7. Perplexity report (May performance deep dive): Mix of sourced facts and proprietary citations. Data‐heavy but some figures (e.g., May average +0.62%, positive frequency 62%) align with other sources. Treat specific percentages with caution, but the broad patterns (May weaker, Fed policy impact, 62% positive rate) are plausible.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. “All calendar months” positive frequency (~65% of months since 1950).  
2. “All Mays” positive frequency (~62% of Mays since 1950).  
3. “Months following ≥5% decline” positive frequency (~65–70% historically).  
4. “Months following large multi-month drawdowns” (~68% rebound).  
Suitability: The event is specifically “May performance,” so the “All Mays” reference class is the primary baseline. To reflect current context (April down ~6%), a secondary adjustment using “months after large drops” is warranted.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Horizon: ~1 calendar month (May 1–end of May).  
• Historical patterns: May has the weakest average return among spring months (+0.30% price return; positive 62% of the time).  
• April 2025 saw a sharp ~5.8% drop—larger than typical spring volatility—raising the likelihood of mean reversion in May. Historically, months following ≥5% drops have positive returns ~65–70% of the time.

(d) Justification  
1. Base rate: “All Mays” have closed higher than April in 62% of cases since 1950.  
2. Seasonal context: May is seasonally soft (“Sell in May” adage), but still ends up positive more often than not.  
3. Recent drawdown: April’s ~6% drop heightens bounce-back probability. Empirical studies show ~65–70% of months rebound after similar declines.  
4. Macro backdrop: No major Fed meeting in May 2025 is expected to surprise with a large hike or cut; absent a policy shock, markets tend to mean-revert.  
5. Expert forecasts: Goldman’s long-run underperformance thesis (3% annualized) suggests muted momentum, but does not strongly argue for a May decline.  
6. No known acute geopolitical or earnings upheaval scheduled uniquely in May that would systematically push the index lower.

Synthesizing: start at 62% (May base rate) and modestly uplift for likely mean reversion (≈+3 points) but cap the adjustment for seasonal headwinds (May is historically the weakest spring month). This yields a near-term unbiased probability in the mid-60% range.

Outside view calibration:  
– Base rate (All Mays positive): 62%  
– Adjustment for April drop mean reversion: +3%  
– Adjustment for seasonal softness (only a small downward tilt): –1%  
= Calibrated outside-view probability ≈64%

Outside View Prediction:  
Probability that the S&P 500 will close higher on the final trading day of May 2025 than on the final trading day of April 2025: **64%**

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. FRED “S&P 500” (via Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)  
      • Data: official daily closing prices for S&P 500 (price index) through 2025-04-28.  
      • Quality: highest—compiled by S&P Dow Jones Indices and hosted by the Fed.  
      • Nature: purely factual; no opinions.  

   b. Macrotrends “S&P 500 Historical Chart”  
      • Data: month‐end inflation-adjusted closing levels back to 1927, plus year-by-year stats through April 2025.  
      • Quality: solid for long-run context, though inflation adjustment may slightly distort pure price‐index moves.  
      • Nature: factual time-series; no forward-looking commentary.  

   c. Investopedia “S&P 500 Average Returns and Historical Performance”  
      • Data: nominal/real avg. annual returns since 1957; concentration metrics (Magnificent Seven share); past drawdowns.  
      • Quality: good for long-term return expectations; clearly flags sources and separates fact from general advisor opinion.  
      • Nature: mainly factual; advisory commentary on dollar-cost averaging is opinion (unsolicited but common).  

   d. Visual Capitalist “Average S&P 500 Return by Month Since 1950”  
      • Data: average total returns (incl. dividends) by calendar month (1950-2024) and 2024 outliers.  
      • Quality: high for seasonality patterns; clearly sourced to YCharts.  
      • Nature: factual data; cautionary “Sell in May” folklore is presented neutrally.  

   e. Axios “S&P 500’s era of hot returns is over, Goldman says”  
      • Data: Goldman Sachs forecast (~3% annualized next decade), probability of underperformance vs. Treasuries, concentration risk.  
      • Quality: reputable for expert opinion; model assumptions disclosed.  
      • Nature: contains expert forecasts (opinion) but grounded in transparent methodology.  

   f. Perplexity report on May returns (1975–2024)  
      • Data: average May returns (+0.62%), positive frequency (62%), breakouts by Fed cycle, macro drivers.  
      • Quality: secondary aggregation—likely accurate but lacks direct trace to raw data.  
      • Nature: mix of fact (historical return stats) and synthesis of research views; treat with moderate confidence.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
   • Candidate classes:  
     1. Monthly S&P 500 price‐index changes (all months, 1927–2025)  
     2. Monthly changes for May specifically (1950–2024)  
     3. Monthly changes following April down-months  
     4. Monthly changes following a year-to-date drawdown >5%  
   • Suitability: Class 2 (May returns) is directly on question. Class 3 and 4 add nuance but risk overfitting. We adopt Class 2 as primary reference.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Horizon: one calendar month (April 30 → May 30/31 final trading day).  
   • Historical analogs: May’s average total return since 1950 is +0.30% (Visual Capitalist), with a 62% win rate in price returns (Perplexity, 1975–2024). April-to-May sequences follow similar month-to-month stats.  

4. Justification for outside view  
   • Base rate (May performance): May has closed above April in roughly 60–62% of past cases.  
   • Seasonality: May is one of the weakest months on average (Visual Capitalist’s 0.30% vs. 1.46% in April), suggesting only a modest edge.  
   • YTD context: The S&P 500 is down ~6% YTD as of April 25, 2025. Months following significant pullbacks sometimes see technical relief rallies, but this effect is not strong enough historically to override the weak-May tendency.  
   • Macro backdrop: Fed likely paused in April; no dramatic policy shift imminent for May, so no strong catalyst to deviate from seasonal norm.  
   • Expert views: Goldman’s decade-ahead outlook is bearish but focused on multiyear returns, not single months. No consensus call to storm into risk in May.  

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor to the raw May win‐rate: 62% (Perplexity, 1975–2024).  
• Slight downward tilt (–2 pp) to account for 2025’s pronounced YTD weakness and historical underperformance in months following sharp early-year drawdowns.  
• Final calibration: 60% probability that May 2025 closes above April 2025.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 60% chance the S&P 500 index will finish May 2025 higher than its April 2025 closing level.

Analysis:  

A. Source analysis  
• FRED daily closes – Pure price data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis / S&P Dow Jones Indices. 100 % factual, no opinion. High reliability; identical to the values that will be used for resolution.  
• Macrotrends 90-year chart – Historical end-of-month levels and annual stats. Mostly factual; the “% Change” figures are simple arithmetic. Good for long-run context; minor risk of transcription error.  
• S&P Dow Jones Indices marketing page – Factual description of index construction. No forward-looking views; not directly useful for probability estimation.  
• Investopedia average-return article – Mixture of facts (long-run annualized returns, concentration data) and generalized advice. Data are sourced, but advisory comments are non-expert opinion and receive little weight.  
• Visual Capitalist monthly-seasonality article – Factual tabulation of 1950-2024 average monthly total returns. No explicit predictions. Source (YCharts) is reputable.  
• Axios / Goldman-Sachs piece – Forward-looking 10-year return outlook from Goldman and Vanguard. These are expert opinions on long-horizon returns, not on one-month moves, so the numbers are not directly germane to May 2025 but confirm a consensus that future long-term drift could be lower.  
• Perplexity report – Synthesises multiple data sets (YCharts, Bankrate, etc.). Key factual nuggets for our purpose:  
  – Since 1975 the S&P 500 has risen in May 31/50 years ≈ 62 %.  
  – Since 2000 the hit-rate is 68 %; since 2015, 70 %.  
  – Average May price change 1975-2024 ≈ +0.62 %.  
These figures match other published seasonality studies, so I treat them as a reasonable statistical summary.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes and suitability:  
1. All calendar months 1950-2024 (≈ 63 % positive). Pro: large N; Con: ignores May-specific seasonality.  
2. May months 1950-2024 (≈ 61-62 % positive). Pro: directly answers “May up or down?”; Con: smaller sample (75 observations).  
3. May months in the past 25 years (2000-2024) (68 %). Pro: more recent market micro-structure and Fed regime; Con: only 25 obs, possible luck.  
4. One-month horizons following a negative YTD through April (2025 YTD is –6 % per Macrotrends) – sample becomes tiny; unsuitable.

The question is literally “Does May beat April?” so reference class 2 is the cleanest baseline; class 3 is a robustness check. I therefore anchor on 61-62 %.

C. Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution: 1 calendar month (≈ 22 trading days). Over such short windows the S&P 500 behaves close to a random walk with a slight upward drift. Historical one-month volatility is roughly 4–5 %; a 0.30-0.60 % average May gain is very small relative to that noise, hence the event is only modestly more likely than a coin flip. Seasonality is weakly unfavourable (May is the 4th-worst average month) but still net-positive.

D. Justification for outside-view probability  
• Long-run upward drift (equity risk premium) pushes the probability above 50 %.  
• Month-specific seasonality trims that by 1-3 percentage points relative to the unconditional monthly 63 %.  
• No inside-view macro adjustment is made at this stage (GDP, earnings, Fed meeting on 14 May, etc.)—those belong in the inside view.  
Thus, the mechanically derived outside-view chance that the S&P 500 closes higher on 30 May 2025 than on 30 April 2025 ≈ 60-62 %.

Outside view calibration:  
Anchor on the best-measured statistic (1950-2024 May hit-rate ≈ 61.5 %). Check against the 2000-2024 sample (68 %) and all-months average (63 %). Give slightly more weight to the longer sample, then nudge 0.5 pp downward to reflect the modest but persistent “Sell in May” effect documented in several studies. Result: 61 %.

Outside View Prediction:  
61 % chance the S&P 500 index will finish May 2025 higher than it finished April 2025.

Final predictions: [70.0, 65.0, 65.0, 58.0, 59.0]

   - Approximately 4.6% gain in final week of April
   - Purely factual with no opinions

4. **Goldman Sachs Research (recent)**
   - Credible institutional source with named expert (David Kostin)
   - Cut S&P 500 forecast due to slower GDP growth (1.7% vs 2.2%)
   - Concerns about tariff impacts (each 5-point increase reduces S&P EPS by 1-2%)
   - Assigns 20% recession probability (next 12 months)

5. **JP Morgan Research (Dec 17, 2024)**
   - Credible but older institutional forecast
   - Named experts (Hussein Malik, Bruce Kasman)
   - Predicts policy divergence across regions
   - Forecasts US interest rates to remain around 4%

6. **Infrastructure Capital Advisors (Feb 2025)**
   - Less authoritative than institutional banks
   - Named source (Jay Hatfield, CEO/CIO)
   - Bullish with S&P target of 7,000
   - Views potential tariffs as "very bullish" for equities

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Recent momentum: S&P 500 gained ~4.6% in the final week of April 2025 (FRED data)
- Historical monthly performance patterns that show May averaging positive returns 62% of the time, with improved frequency (70%) since 2015 (outside view)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- March 2025 showed significant decline (-5.75%), suggesting potential for continued recovery/mean reversion
- Goldman Sachs' reduced economic growth forecast and tariff concerns (credible institutional source)
- Current market valuation metrics (P/E ratio of 27.99, VIX at 25.15) indicating somewhat elevated valuations

**Weak Evidence:**
- JP Morgan's outlook from December 2024 (outdated)
- Infrastructure Capital's highly bullish stance, which appears to be an outlier

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

This prediction covers exactly one month (May 2025), which begins in just 1-2 days from analysis date.

If the timeframe were shorter (e.g., first two weeks of May), I would place even greater emphasis on the recent strong momentum seen in late April, which would likely increase my probability estimate.

If the timeframe were longer (e.g., through summer 2025), I would give more weight to the fundamental economic concerns raised by Goldman Sachs and the high market valuations, which would likely decrease my probability estimate.

The one-month timeframe is ideal for applying the historical May performance statistics while also considering immediate momentum effects.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view probability of 65%, I need to adjust based on the current information:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. Exceptional momentum in late April 2025 (+4.6% in one week) suggests strong buying pressure that could continue into May
2. Pattern of significant drop (March) followed by recovery (April) often continues for multiple months
3. Historical statistics show May has become increasingly reliable for positive returns (70% since 2015)

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. Goldman Sachs's reduced economic outlook and specific concerns about tariff impacts
2. Elevated market valuations (P/E ratio of 27.99)
3. Volatility indicators (VIX at 25.15 in March) showing some market uncertainty

# Probability Calibration

The outside view of 65% already accounts for May's historical performance pattern. The most significant new information is the very strong upward momentum in late April 2025 (+4.6% in one week).

While this momentum is compelling, I must be careful not to over-extrapolate from a single week of data. The strong counterpoints from Goldman Sachs regarding slowing GDP growth and tariff concerns represent legitimate headwinds, even if their immediate impact in May is uncertain.

Given the strength of the recent momentum and how close we are to the beginning of May (when momentum effects are most relevant), I believe an upward adjustment to the outside view is warranted, but with moderation to avoid recency bias.

I'll adjust the outside view probability of 65% upward by 5 percentage points to 70%.

# Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will S&P 500 close higher on May 31, 2025 than on April 30, 2025?
2. Base rate: 65% from historical May performance patterns
3. Consistency: "70 out of 100 times, the S&P 500 will close higher at the end of May than April 2025." This aligns with my analysis.
4. Key evidence: Strong April end momentum (+4.6% week); Historical May positive frequency (62-70%); Goldman Sachs reduced outlook; Elevated P/E ratio (27.99)
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected early May negative economic shock or geopolitical event could disrupt momentum
6. Status quo: Current upward momentum likely continues short-term

Probability: 70%
Predicted Probability: 70.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **YCharts S&P 500 Data (April 5, 2025)**: High-quality factual source with precise market metrics through March 31, 2025. Shows March closed at 5,611.85, down 5.75% from February.

2. **YCharts S&P 500 Monthly Return (April 5, 2025)**: Pure factual data on historical monthly returns with related metrics. March 2025 return was -5.75%, well below the long-term average monthly return of +0.56%.

3. **FRED S&P 500 Data (April 28, 2025)**: Most recent and authoritative source directly from Federal Reserve. Shows daily closing values through April 28, 2025 (5,528.75), revealing a recovery trend in late April.

4. **Goldman Sachs Research (early 2025)**: High-quality analysis from identified expert David Kostin (Chief U.S. Equity Strategist). Factual content includes reduced GDP growth forecasts (2.2% to 1.7%) and tariff projections. Expert opinions note that "uncertainty headwinds are typically short-lived" but "slower growth suggests lower valuations."

5. **J.P. Morgan Outlook (December 17, 2024)**: Somewhat dated but provides insights from multiple named experts. Emphasizes policy divergence and unsynchronized business cycles for 2025. More relevant for structural trends than May-specific prediction.

6. **Seeking Alpha Commentary (February 2025)**: Medium-quality source from identified expert Jay Hatfield (CEO/CIO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors). Contains bullish outlook (S&P 500 target of 7,000) and views on tariff impacts, but limited substantiation.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Recent recovery momentum**: FRED data shows S&P 500 rising from 5,287.76 (April 22) to 5,528.75 (April 28), a 4.6% gain in one week, establishing positive momentum entering May.
- **Historical pattern following significant drops**: After March's 5.75% decline, historical patterns suggest increased likelihood of positive returns (65-70% probability versus the normal 62% for May).
- **Seasonal patterns**: May historically closes positive approximately 62% of the time, providing a solid base rate.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Goldman Sachs economic outlook**: Reduced GDP growth forecasts (1.7% vs 2.2%) and estimated tariff impacts suggest headwinds, but Kostin notes uncertainty impacts are "typically short-lived."
- **Current valuation metrics**: P/E ratio of 27.99 and Shiller CAPE ratio of 33.12 (March 2025) indicate above-average valuations, which could limit upside potential.
- **VIX level of 25.15**: Elevated volatility indicator as of March 2025 suggests continued market uncertainty.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Infrastructure Capital's bullish stance**: Target of 7,000 for S&P 500 lacks May-specific rationale.
- **Dollar strength as "highly deflationary"**: Connection to May equity performance is speculative.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction covers exactly one month (May 1-31, 2025), comparing April's final trading day to May's final trading day.

**If timeframe halved**: A two-week prediction would place greater weight on the current positive momentum observed in late April, as short-term trends more reliably continue over shorter periods. This would likely increase the probability to 67-69%.

**If timeframe doubled**: A two-month prediction (May-June) would reduce emphasis on recent momentum and increase weight on fundamental factors (slower GDP growth, tariff impacts). This would likely decrease the probability to 58-60%, as longer periods allow more time for economic conditions to influence markets.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 64%, the following factors adjust this probability:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. **Late April recovery momentum (+2%)**: The 4.6% rise in late April (April 22-28) establishes positive momentum entering May, increasing the likelihood of continued gains.
2. **Mean reversion following March decline (+1.5%)**: The significant 5.75% drop in March sets up potential for continued recovery, aligned with historical patterns following large declines.
3. **Absence of scheduled Fed meetings in May (+0.5%)**: No major Federal Reserve policy announcements likely in May reduces the risk of policy-driven volatility.

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. **Economic growth concerns (-1.5%)**: Goldman's reduced GDP growth forecast (1.7% vs 2.2%) suggests potential earnings pressure.
2. **Elevated market valuations (-1%)**: P/E ratio of 27.99 and Shiller CAPE of 33.12 indicate the market remains highly valued by historical standards.
3. **Elevated VIX level (-0.5%)**: VIX at 25.15 suggests continued market uncertainty.

Net adjustment: +1.0%

# Probability Calibration

Starting with outside view base rate: 64%
Adding inside view net adjustment: +1.0%
Calibrated probability: 65%

The calibrated probability of 65% represents a modest adjustment to the outside view, reflecting the balance between positive momentum and recovery factors against economic growth concerns and high valuations.

# Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the S&P 500 close higher on the last trading day of May 2025 than on the last trading day of April 2025?

2. **Base rate**: 64% probability based on historical May performance and patterns following market declines.

3. **Consistency**: 65 out of 100 times, the S&P 500 will close higher at the end of May 2025 than at the end of April 2025.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - S&P 500 rose 4.6% in late April 2025, indicating positive momentum
   - March 2025 saw a 5.75% decline, setting up potential mean reversion
   - Economic growth forecasts reduced (GDP from 2.2% to 1.7%)
   - P/E ratio (27.99) indicates high valuations that could limit upside
   - No major Fed meetings scheduled for May reduces policy risk

5. **Blind-spot**: Sudden geopolitical crisis or unexpected economic shock in early May could reverse the late April momentum.

6. **Status quo**: Recent recovery trend likely to continue absent major catalysts.

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

Analysis:
1. Paraphrase  
Will the S&P 500’s closing value on the final trading day of May 2025 exceed its closing value on April 30, 2025?

2. Source analysis  
• FRED (daily closes through April 28, 2025): highly reliable Fed data; shows strong late-April momentum.  
• Macrotrends (1927–2025 YTD): reputable long-run series; 2025 YTD down 6.06%.  
• Investopedia (1957–2024 avg. returns): solid secondary source; annualized ~10.13%, average monthly ~0.56%.  
• Visual Capitalist (May returns since 1950): data from YCharts; May average +0.30%, positive 62% of years.  
• Axios/Goldman Sachs projections: reputable expert forecasts; GS sees slower growth, 20% recession odds.  
• Perplexity (1975–2024 May returns): AI summary citing multiple studies; May positive 62% long-term, 70% since 2015.

3. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
– Historical May performance: positive in 62% of years (Visual Capitalist), 70% last decade (Perplexity).  
Moderate evidence  
– Late-April upward momentum (FRED).  
– Market concentration risks & elevated valuations (P/E ~28, Shiller CAPE ~33).  
Weak evidence  
– Long-run decade-ahead forecasts (3–5% annual returns) not directly tied to one-month moves.  
– Tariff and policy speculation with mixed historic analogies.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Time horizon is one month (May 2025).  
– If halved (~2 weeks), momentum and technical factors dominate → slightly higher probability (≈67%).  
– If doubled (2 months), macro risks (growth, policy, earnings season) increase → slightly lower probability (≈60%).

5. Justification & adjustment from outside view  
Outside view base rate: 62% chance of a positive May (1950–2024).  
Adjustments:  
– +3 pts for strong late-April rally carrying into May (moderate evidence).  
– –1 pt for elevated valuations, YTD weakness, and policy headwinds (moderate evidence).  
Net adjustment: +2 pts → 64%. Rounding to reflect residual uncertainty gives 65%.

Probability calibration  
I aim to predict the true probability that May 2025 closes above April 30. A 65% estimate implies that in 100 analogous months, the S&P 500 would rise in 65. Differences of ±10% materially change implied odds (e.g., 55% vs. 75%). Given modest positive seasonality and current momentum offset by headwinds, 65% balances these factors.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: S&P 500’s final May 2025 close > final April 2025 close.  
2. Base rate: 62% positive Mays historically.  
3. Consistency check: “65 out of 100 times, May closes above April.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   – Historical May positive frequency 62% (strong).  
   – Recent decade May positives 70% (moderate).  
   – Late-April upward momentum (moderate).  
   – Elevated P/E and policy headwinds (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden Fed pivot or large geopolitical shock in early May could reverse momentum, lowering this probability by ~10 points.  
6. Status quo: Markets often drift modestly higher in May; small tilt toward continuation is justified.

“Will the S&P 500 close higher on the last trading day of May 2025 than it does on the last trading day of April 2025?” (One‐month horizon.)

2. Source Analysis  
a. FRED (Fed St. Louis) Daily Closes (through 2025-04-28)

• May price returns since 1950: +0.30% average, 62% positive (Visual Capitalist / Perplexity).  
• Outside‐view base rate: 62% chance of May outperformance vs. April.

4. Evidence Analysis (weighing)  
Strong Evidence  
– Historical May win‐rate ≈62% (seasonality is robust).  
Moderate Evidence  
– YTD 2025 drawdown (~6% through late April) suggests technical relief rally potential but not guaranteed.  
– Fed paused in April; no imminent cut to buoy sentiment materially in May.  
– Q1 earnings season (mid-May) likely flat to modestly positive—some support but muted.  
Weak Evidence  
– Tariff hike headlines / policy uncertainty (20–25% recession odds) could spook markets but far‐term.  
– Boutique bullish forecasts (S&N target 7,000) are outliers.  

5. Timeframe Analysis  
• Horizon: ~1 month (today 4/29 → final May 30 or 31).  
• If horizon halved (2 weeks), noise dominates; probability drifts toward 50%.  
• If doubled (2 months): seasonal patterns weaken; macro trends (Fed cycle, earnings) dominate; probability might edge down further toward ~55%.

6. Justification & Inside‐view Adjustment  
Outside view (62%) anchored on long‐term May performance.  
Adjustments:  
• Technical pullback/recovery nuance (moderate): +1 pp (oversold bounce).  
• Macro headwinds (Fed high-for-long, slower GDP, tariffs) (moderate): –3 pp.  
• Q1 earnings modestly supportive (weak): +1 pp.  
• Seasonally weak month offset by historical relief pattern after sharp early-year drawdowns (weak): +1 pp.  

Net adjustment: –0. pp (62% → 60%), but given recent mild upside in late-April and relative absence of strong catalysts, we tilt further down by 2 pp to reflect elevated uncertainty and April’s rebound damping May’s follow-through.

Inside‐view probability: 58%.

Probability calibration  
I estimate a 58% chance that the S&P 500 close on the final trading day of May 2025 exceeds its closing level on the final trading day of April 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: One-month, close May vs. close April – correct.  
2. Base rate: 62% May win‐rate historically.  
3. Consistency: “58 out of 100 times, May closes above April”—fits slight under‐seasonal tilt.  
4. Key evidence (each <20w):  
  • Historical May win‐rate 62%.  
  • YTD drawdown → technical bounce prospects.  
  • Fed pause, no dovish catalyst → headwinds.  
  • Q1 earnings flat to slightly up → modest support.  
5. Blind spot: Late-May geopolitical shock could flip rally into sell-off (downward).  
6. Status quo: Markets grind higher slowly; slight bias to “Yes.”

Distinguishing fact vs. opinion preserved above.

b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Long-run market drift: equities rise ≈63 % of all months (structural risk premium).  
• May-specific hit-rate 1950-2024 ≈61 % (large independent historical sample).  

Moderate evidence  
• Current macro: Goldman & J.P.M. both foresee slower 2025 growth and policy/tariff headwinds → slightly negative.  
• Elevated VIX 25 (well above 10-yr median 17) → higher probability of a sizeable move either way, tilts probability toward 50 %.  
• Short-term momentum: index rebounded +4.6 % from Apr 22 low to Apr 28, suggesting fading selling pressure → modest positive.  

Weak evidence  
• Infrastructure Capital’s 7 000 target (bullish) – single marketing piece; limited methodology.  
• “Sell in May” folklore – noisy and economically small (<0.1σ effect).

c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 1.9 trading-days to set April close, then 21-22 May trading days → 1-month horizon.  
If horizon were halved (two trading weeks) macro news & earnings reactions would dominate; probability would move 1-2 pp toward 50 %.  
If horizon were doubled (two months) secular drift & Fed path clarity would matter more; odds would edge back up 2-3 pp.

d) Justification / inside-view shifts  
Outside-view anchor: 61 % (May 1950-2024 hit-rate).  

Adjustments  
–1.5 pp Elevated VIX/uncertainty → wider tails, less drift advantage. (Moderate evidence)  
–1.0 pp Goldman & J.P.M. slower-growth / tariff concerns raise left-tail risk. (Moderate)  
+0.5 pp Recent rebound indicates technical support; breadth improving. (Moderate–weak)  

Net adjustment: –2 pp → 59 %.

Probability calibration
Credible range (10th–90th percentile) for a one-month direction call with this data ≈ 45 %-70 %.  
My point estimate 59 % implies odds 59 : 41; modest edge over a coin-flip yet shy of historical unconditional 63 : 37, consistent with elevated volatility and macro headwinds.

Checklist:
1. “Will May 2025 S&P 500 close above April 2025?” Resolved with Yahoo Finance end-of-month closes.  
2. Base rate: 61 % (May up historically).  
3. Result line: “59 out of 100 times, May closes higher than April.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) 61 % May hit-rate; (ii) VIX 25 > median; (iii) Goldman/J.P.M. slower-growth outlook; (iv) +4.6 % late-April bounce.  
5. Blind-spot: Surprise dovish Fed pivot on 14 May could spark >5 % rally → probability closer to 70 %.  
6. Status-quo: Drift slightly up; volatility argues for modest reversion toward 50 %, hence –2 pp adjustment.

- Infrastructure Capital's highly bullish stance, which appears to be an outlier

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

This prediction covers exactly one month (May 2025), which begins in just 1-2 days from analysis date.

If the timeframe were shorter (e.g., first two weeks of May), I would place even greater emphasis on the recent strong momentum seen in late April, which would likely increase my probability estimate.

If the timeframe were longer (e.g., through summer 2025), I would give more weight to the fundamental economic concerns raised by Goldman Sachs and the high market valuations, which would likely decrease my probability estimate.

The one-month timeframe is ideal for applying the historical May performance statistics while also considering immediate momentum effects.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view probability of 65%, I need to adjust based on the current information:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. Exceptional momentum in late April 2025 (+4.6% in one week) suggests strong buying pressure that could continue into May
2. Pattern of significant drop (March) followed by recovery (April) often continues for multiple months
3. Historical statistics show May has become increasingly reliable for positive returns (70% since 2015)

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. Goldman Sachs's reduced economic outlook and specific concerns about tariff impacts
2. Elevated market valuations (P/E ratio of 27.99)
3. Volatility indicators (VIX at 25.15 in March) showing some market uncertainty

# Probability Calibration

The outside view of 65% already accounts for May's historical performance pattern. The most significant new information is the very strong upward momentum in late April 2025 (+4.6% in one week).

While this momentum is compelling, I must be careful not to over-extrapolate from a single week of data. The strong counterpoints from Goldman Sachs regarding slowing GDP growth and tariff concerns represent legitimate headwinds, even if their immediate impact in May is uncertain.

Given the strength of the recent momentum and how close we are to the beginning of May (when momentum effects are most relevant), I believe an upward adjustment to the outside view is warranted, but with moderation to avoid recency bias.

I'll adjust the outside view probability of 65% upward by 5 percentage points to 70%.

# Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will S&P 500 close higher on May 31, 2025 than on April 30, 2025?
2. Base rate: 65% from historical May performance patterns
3. Consistency: "70 out of 100 times, the S&P 500 will close higher at the end of May than April 2025." This aligns with my analysis.
4. Key evidence: Strong April end momentum (+4.6% week); Historical May positive frequency (62-70%); Goldman Sachs reduced outlook; Elevated P/E ratio (27.99)
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected early May negative economic shock or geopolitical event could disrupt momentum
6. Status quo: Current upward momentum likely continues short-term

Probability: 70%
Predicted Probability: 70.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **YCharts S&P 500 Data (April 5, 2025)**: High-quality factual source with precise market metrics through March 31, 2025. Shows March closed at 5,611.85, down 5.75% from February.

2. **YCharts S&P 500 Monthly Return (April 5, 2025)**: Pure factual data on historical monthly returns with related metrics. March 2025 return was -5.75%, well below the long-term average monthly return of +0.56%.

3. **FRED S&P 500 Data (April 28, 2025)**: Most recent and authoritative source directly from Federal Reserve. Shows daily closing values through April 28, 2025 (5,528.75), revealing a recovery trend in late April.

4. **Goldman Sachs Research (early 2025)**: High-quality analysis from identified expert David Kostin (Chief U.S. Equity Strategist). Factual content includes reduced GDP growth forecasts (2.2% to 1.7%) and tariff projections. Expert opinions note that "uncertainty headwinds are typically short-lived" but "slower growth suggests lower valuations."

5. **J.P. Morgan Outlook (December 17, 2024)**: Somewhat dated but provides insights from multiple named experts. Emphasizes policy divergence and unsynchronized business cycles for 2025. More relevant for structural trends than May-specific prediction.

6. **Seeking Alpha Commentary (February 2025)**: Medium-quality source from identified expert Jay Hatfield (CEO/CIO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors). Contains bullish outlook (S&P 500 target of 7,000) and views on tariff impacts, but limited substantiation.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Recent recovery momentum**: FRED data shows S&P 500 rising from 5,287.76 (April 22) to 5,528.75 (April 28), a 4.6% gain in one week, establishing positive momentum entering May.
- **Historical pattern following significant drops**: After March's 5.75% decline, historical patterns suggest increased likelihood of positive returns (65-70% probability versus the normal 62% for May).
- **Seasonal patterns**: May historically closes positive approximately 62% of the time, providing a solid base rate.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Goldman Sachs economic outlook**: Reduced GDP growth forecasts (1.7% vs 2.2%) and estimated tariff impacts suggest headwinds, but Kostin notes uncertainty impacts are "typically short-lived."
- **Current valuation metrics**: P/E ratio of 27.99 and Shiller CAPE ratio of 33.12 (March 2025) indicate above-average valuations, which could limit upside potential.
- **VIX level of 25.15**: Elevated volatility indicator as of March 2025 suggests continued market uncertainty.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Infrastructure Capital's bullish stance**: Target of 7,000 for S&P 500 lacks May-specific rationale.
- **Dollar strength as "highly deflationary"**: Connection to May equity performance is speculative.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction covers exactly one month (May 1-31, 2025), comparing April's final trading day to May's final trading day.

**If timeframe halved**: A two-week prediction would place greater weight on the current positive momentum observed in late April, as short-term trends more reliably continue over shorter periods. This would likely increase the probability to 67-69%.

**If timeframe doubled**: A two-month prediction (May-June) would reduce emphasis on recent momentum and increase weight on fundamental factors (slower GDP growth, tariff impacts). This would likely decrease the probability to 58-60%, as longer periods allow more time for economic conditions to influence markets.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 64%, the following factors adjust this probability:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. **Late April recovery momentum (+2%)**: The 4.6% rise in late April (April 22-28) establishes positive momentum entering May, increasing the likelihood of continued gains.
2. **Mean reversion following March decline (+1.5%)**: The significant 5.75% drop in March sets up potential for continued recovery, aligned with historical patterns following large declines.
3. **Absence of scheduled Fed meetings in May (+0.5%)**: No major Federal Reserve policy announcements likely in May reduces the risk of policy-driven volatility.

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. **Economic growth concerns (-1.5%)**: Goldman's reduced GDP growth forecast (1.7% vs 2.2%) suggests potential earnings pressure.
2. **Elevated market valuations (-1%)**: P/E ratio of 27.99 and Shiller CAPE of 33.12 indicate the market remains highly valued by historical standards.
3. **Elevated VIX level (-0.5%)**: VIX at 25.15 suggests continued market uncertainty.

Net adjustment: +1.0%

# Probability Calibration

Starting with outside view base rate: 64%
Adding inside view net adjustment: +1.0%
Calibrated probability: 65%

The calibrated probability of 65% represents a modest adjustment to the outside view, reflecting the balance between positive momentum and recovery factors against economic growth concerns and high valuations.

# Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the S&P 500 close higher on the last trading day of May 2025 than on the last trading day of April 2025?

2. **Base rate**: 64% probability based on historical May performance and patterns following market declines.

3. **Consistency**: 65 out of 100 times, the S&P 500 will close higher at the end of May 2025 than at the end of April 2025.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - S&P 500 rose 4.6% in late April 2025, indicating positive momentum
   - March 2025 saw a 5.75% decline, setting up potential mean reversion
   - Economic growth forecasts reduced (GDP from 2.2% to 1.7%)
   - P/E ratio (27.99) indicates high valuations that could limit upside
   - No major Fed meetings scheduled for May reduces policy risk

5. **Blind-spot**: Sudden geopolitical crisis or unexpected economic shock in early May could reverse the late April momentum.

6. **Status quo**: Recent recovery trend likely to continue absent major catalysts.

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

Analysis:
1. Paraphrase  
Will the S&P 500’s closing value on the final trading day of May 2025 exceed its closing value on April 30, 2025?

2. Source analysis  
• FRED (daily closes through April 28, 2025): highly reliable Fed data; shows strong late-April momentum.  
• Macrotrends (1927–2025 YTD): reputable long-run series; 2025 YTD down 6.06%.  
• Investopedia (1957–2024 avg. returns): solid secondary source; annualized ~10.13%, average monthly ~0.56%.  
• Visual Capitalist (May returns since 1950): data from YCharts; May average +0.30%, positive 62% of years.  
• Axios/Goldman Sachs projections: reputable expert forecasts; GS sees slower growth, 20% recession odds.  
• Perplexity (1975–2024 May returns): AI summary citing multiple studies; May positive 62% long-term, 70% since 2015.

3. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
– Historical May performance: positive in 62% of years (Visual Capitalist), 70% last decade (Perplexity).  
Moderate evidence  
– Late-April upward momentum (FRED).  
– Market concentration risks & elevated valuations (P/E ~28, Shiller CAPE ~33).  
Weak evidence  
– Long-run decade-ahead forecasts (3–5% annual returns) not directly tied to one-month moves.  
– Tariff and policy speculation with mixed historic analogies.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Time horizon is one month (May 2025).  
– If halved (~2 weeks), momentum and technical factors dominate → slightly higher probability (≈67%).  
– If doubled (2 months), macro risks (growth, policy, earnings season) increase → slightly lower probability (≈60%).

5. Justification & adjustment from outside view  
Outside view base rate: 62% chance of a positive May (1950–2024).  
Adjustments:  
– +3 pts for strong late-April rally carrying into May (moderate evidence).  
– –1 pt for elevated valuations, YTD weakness, and policy headwinds (moderate evidence).  
Net adjustment: +2 pts → 64%. Rounding to reflect residual uncertainty gives 65%.

Probability calibration  
I aim to predict the true probability that May 2025 closes above April 30. A 65% estimate implies that in 100 analogous months, the S&P 500 would rise in 65. Differences of ±10% materially change implied odds (e.g., 55% vs. 75%). Given modest positive seasonality and current momentum offset by headwinds, 65% balances these factors.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: S&P 500’s final May 2025 close > final April 2025 close.  
2. Base rate: 62% positive Mays historically.  
3. Consistency check: “65 out of 100 times, May closes above April.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   – Historical May positive frequency 62% (strong).  
   – Recent decade May positives 70% (moderate).  
   – Late-April upward momentum (moderate).  
   – Elevated P/E and policy headwinds (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden Fed pivot or large geopolitical shock in early May could reverse momentum, lowering this probability by ~10 points.  
6. Status quo: Markets often drift modestly higher in May; small tilt toward continuation is justified.

“Will the S&P 500 close higher on the last trading day of May 2025 than it does on the last trading day of April 2025?” (One‐month horizon.)

2. Source Analysis  
a. FRED (Fed St. Louis) Daily Closes (through 2025-04-28)  
  • Quality: Authoritative, raw price‐only index data.  
  • Facts only; no opinions.

e. J.P. Morgan “Year of Divergence”  
  • Quality: Leading bank; partial transcript.  
  • Opinions on rate outlook, policy risks.  
f. Seeking Alpha (Infrastructure Capital Advisors)  
  • Quality: Boutique firm; bullish equity stance on tariffs.

3. Reference-class Base Rate  
• May price returns since 1950: +0.30% average, 62% positive (Visual Capitalist / Perplexity).  
• Outside‐view base rate: 62% chance of May outperformance vs. April.

4. Evidence Analysis (weighing)  
Strong Evidence  
– Historical May win‐rate ≈62% (seasonality is robust).  
Moderate Evidence  
– YTD 2025 drawdown (~6% through late April) suggests technical relief rally potential but not guaranteed.  
– Fed paused in April; no imminent cut to buoy sentiment materially in May.  
– Q1 earnings season (mid-May) likely flat to modestly positive—some support but muted.  
Weak Evidence  
– Tariff hike headlines / policy uncertainty (20–25% recession odds) could spook markets but far‐term.  
– Boutique bullish forecasts (S&N target 7,000) are outliers.  

5. Timeframe Analysis  
• Horizon: ~1 month (today 4/29 → final May 30 or 31).  
• If horizon halved (2 weeks), noise dominates; probability drifts toward 50%.  
• If doubled (2 months): seasonal patterns weaken; macro trends (Fed cycle, earnings) dominate; probability might edge down further toward ~55%.

6. Justification & Inside‐view Adjustment  
Outside view (62%) anchored on long‐term May performance.  
Adjustments:  
• Technical pullback/recovery nuance (moderate): +1 pp (oversold bounce).  
• Macro headwinds (Fed high-for-long, slower GDP, tariffs) (moderate): –3 pp.  
• Q1 earnings modestly supportive (weak): +1 pp.  
• Seasonally weak month offset by historical relief pattern after sharp early-year drawdowns (weak): +1 pp.  

Net adjustment: –0. pp (62% → 60%), but given recent mild upside in late-April and relative absence of strong catalysts, we tilt further down by 2 pp to reflect elevated uncertainty and April’s rebound damping May’s follow-through.

Inside‐view probability: 58%.

Probability calibration  
I estimate a 58% chance that the S&P 500 close on the final trading day of May 2025 exceeds its closing level on the final trading day of April 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: One-month, close May vs. close April – correct.  
2. Base rate: 62% May win‐rate historically.  
3. Consistency: “58 out of 100 times, May closes above April”—fits slight under‐seasonal tilt.  
4. Key evidence (each <20w):  
  • Historical May win‐rate 62%.  
  • YTD drawdown → technical bounce prospects.  
  • Fed pause, no dovish catalyst → headwinds.  
  • Q1 earnings flat to slightly up → modest support.  
5. Blind spot: Late-May geopolitical shock could flip rally into sell-off (downward).  
6. Status quo: Markets grind higher slowly; slight bias to “Yes.”

• Visual Capitalist / Perplexity seasonality digest (to Dec ’24). Factual historical hit-rates for May (≈61 %). Medium quality; corroborated elsewhere.

Distinguishing fact vs. opinion preserved above.

b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Long-run market drift: equities rise ≈63 % of all months (structural risk premium).  
• May-specific hit-rate 1950-2024 ≈61 % (large independent historical sample).  

Moderate evidence  
• Current macro: Goldman & J.P.M. both foresee slower 2025 growth and policy/tariff headwinds → slightly negative.  
• Elevated VIX 25 (well above 10-yr median 17) → higher probability of a sizeable move either way, tilts probability toward 50 %.  
• Short-term momentum: index rebounded +4.6 % from Apr 22 low to Apr 28, suggesting fading selling pressure → modest positive.  

Weak evidence  
• Infrastructure Capital’s 7 000 target (bullish) – single marketing piece; limited methodology.  
• “Sell in May” folklore – noisy and economically small (<0.1σ effect).

c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 1.9 trading-days to set April close, then 21-22 May trading days → 1-month horizon.  
If horizon were halved (two trading weeks) macro news & earnings reactions would dominate; probability would move 1-2 pp toward 50 %.  
If horizon were doubled (two months) secular drift & Fed path clarity would matter more; odds would edge back up 2-3 pp.

d) Justification / inside-view shifts  
Outside-view anchor: 61 % (May 1950-2024 hit-rate).  

Adjustments  
–1.5 pp Elevated VIX/uncertainty → wider tails, less drift advantage. (Moderate evidence)  
–1.0 pp Goldman & J.P.M. slower-growth / tariff concerns raise left-tail risk. (Moderate)  
+0.5 pp Recent rebound indicates technical support; breadth improving. (Moderate–weak)  

Net adjustment: –2 pp → 59 %.

Probability calibration
Credible range (10th–90th percentile) for a one-month direction call with this data ≈ 45 %-70 %.  
My point estimate 59 % implies odds 59 : 41; modest edge over a coin-flip yet shy of historical unconditional 63 : 37, consistent with elevated volatility and macro headwinds.

Checklist:
1. “Will May 2025 S&P 500 close above April 2025?” Resolved with Yahoo Finance end-of-month closes.  
2. Base rate: 61 % (May up historically).  
3. Result line: “59 out of 100 times, May closes higher than April.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) 61 % May hit-rate; (ii) VIX 25 > median; (iii) Goldman/J.P.M. slower-growth outlook; (iv) +4.6 % late-April bounce.  
5. Blind-spot: Surprise dovish Fed pivot on 14 May could spark >5 % rally → probability closer to 70 %.  
6. Status-quo: Drift slightly up; volatility argues for modest reversion toward 50 %, hence –2 pp adjustment.

Probability: 59%
Predicted Probability: 59.0%...
