Analysis:
The forecasting question hinges on identifying any new large-scale protests in India (10,000+ participants) reported by the Global Protest Tracker before July 1, 2025. To build an inside-view, we need recent news on mass demonstrations—especially around high-tension issues like communal laws, land rights, farmers’ agitations, labor strikes or student unrest—that mention crowd sizes at or above the 10,000 threshold. We’ll search for articles since the question launch (post–April 2025) that specify participant estimates, dates, and locations to gauge whether such protests have occurred.

<Summary source="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/global-interactive-map-reveals-blistering-attack-peaceful-protests-across-world">
Amnesty International (19 Sep) has launched an interactive global map—part of its “Protect the Protest” campaign—documenting state-sanctioned violence and legal restrictions on peaceful assembly in real time. Key points:

1. Map scope and methodology  
 • Covers 156 countries, updated continuously.  
 • Plots incidents of unlawful dispersal, arrests, beatings, killings, and use of “less lethal” weapons (tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray, batons).  
 • Includes country-by-country details of protest laws, relevant UN reports and court judgements, plus action resources.

2. Major findings (2022 data unless otherwise noted)  
 • Credible allegations of unlawful force against protesters in 86 countries.  
 • In 37 countries, security forces used lethal weapons to control crowds.  
 • Over 50% of covered countries saw arbitrary arrests of protesters.  
 • Specific cases:  
   – India: use of guns, tear gas, baton charges, internet shutdowns, forced evictions against demonstrators.  
   – China: protesters face harassment, prosecution, and possible loss of education or housing.  
   – Iran: hundreds killed, tens of thousands arbitrarily detained across successive nationwide protests.  
   – Peru (Dec 2022–Feb 2023): 49 protester deaths from unlawful force.

3. Country-specific legislation and ratings  
 • United Kingdom: scores 5.6/10 on assembly rights in Human Rights Measurement Initiative’s 2023 tracker (worse than average).  
   – New powers under the 2022 Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act and 2023 Public Order Act criminalise wide protest activities, expand stop-and-search, and allow pre-emptive bans.  
   – June 2024 regulations further lower thresholds for intervention—potentially suppressing even silent or symbolic demonstrations.  

4. Expert commentary (all from named Amnesty researchers)  
 • Patrick Wilcken (Military, Security & Policing Researcher):  
   – “Peaceful protest is a right…for far too long authorities have launched a blistering attack…from abusive use of force…enforced disappearances and state-sanctioned killings.”  
   – Warns of the unregulated global trade in less lethal weapons and calls for an international treaty to control policing equipment.  
 • Oliver Feeley-Sprague (Amnesty UK Programme Director):  
   – Describes the UK’s new regime as a “bleak new era for protest rights” giving police “almost unlimited powers” to shut down peaceful demonstrations.  

5. Campaign objectives  
 • Expose governments that treat protest as a threat rather than a right.  
 • Pressure states to repeal repressive laws, stop violent crackdowns and facilitate peaceful assembly.  
 • Mobilise public action via Amnesty’s platform.

<Summary source="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/30/mapping-major-protests-around-the-world">
Below is a summary of Mohammed Haddad’s Al Jazeera article “Mapping major protests around the world.”  

Facts and statistics  
• The Mass Mobilisation Data Project (tracking protests outside the U.S.) has recorded nearly 7,000 protests in 153 countries over the past ten years.  
• Between 2010 and 2020 there were at least 900 protests globally with more than 10,000 participants.  
• According to ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project):  
  – Since August 9, 2020, at least 2,800 farmer protests have been recorded across India.  
  – Between 2010 and 2021, roughly 4,800 people died in protests worldwide.  
  – Over 90 percent of demonstrations are peaceful.  
• On November 26, 2020, Indian trade unions claimed 250 million people took part in a 24-hour general strike (though precise crowd‐count methods vary).  
• Tens of thousands of Indian farmers have blocked highways around New Delhi for months, demanding repeal of three agriculture-sector laws.  

Notable country-level movements  
• France: “Yellow Vest” anti-fuel‐tax/privatization protests since late 2018.  
• Lebanon: ongoing protests since October 2019 amid financial collapse and demands to end corruption.  
• Hong Kong: two-plus-year pro-democracy protests triggered by a proposed extradition bill and broader mainland China concerns.  
• Others: frequent smaller demonstrations in Kenya, Germany, the UK, Greece, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Yemen, etc.  

Historical and methodological context  
• Crowd‐size estimation can be politicized; the Jacobs Method (area × density) offers a standardized approach.  
• In 2003, some six million people across 650 cities protested the Iraq invasion.  
• In 2019, climate strikes spanned an estimated 185 countries.  
• Online mobilizations (petitions, social media campaigns) have also reached millions.  

Violent crackdowns and fatalities  
• Myanmar (February 2021 coup protests): at least 114 killed by security forces.  
• Egypt’s 2013 Rabaa massacre: over 800 protesters killed on August 14, 2013.  
• Arab Spring (2011): hundreds killed across Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Libya, Yemen, Syria.  
• Fatality counts vary considerably by source.

<Summary source="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/13/3-dead-over-150-arrested-in-india-protests-over-muslim-properties-bill">
Here’s a concise extraction of the key points from the Al Jazeera article “India deploys troops after Waqf bill protests marred by violence”:

Facts & figures  
• The federal Waqf Amendment Bill—in effect since earlier this month—alters a 1995 law governing Muslim waqf (religious or charitable endowments), which total over US$14 billion in assets.  
• In Murshidabad district (West Bengal), protests over the bill on Friday and Saturday resulted in three deaths and more than 150 arrests (The Times of India).  
• The Calcutta High Court ordered the immediate deployment of the paramilitary Border Security Force (BSF) to assist local police.  

Named sources & positions  
• Karni Singh (Inspector General, BSF South Bengal Frontier) said BSF was sent “to help” the police, not to act independently.  
• Opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi: the bill is “aimed at Muslims today but sets a precedent to target other communities in the future.”  
• West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee (Trinamool Congress) on X:  
  – “This law will not be applicable in our state. So why the riot?”  
  – Urged people “not to engage in any non-religious behaviour in the name of religion” and promised legal action against rioters.  
• BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari (state opposition leader) on X: claimed over 400 Hindus fled Murshidabad citing “religious persecution,” blamed Banerjee for “breakdown of law & order.”  
• TMC MP Saugata Roy (quoted in The Times of India): said Banerjee convened a meeting to pacify the Muslim community and described the protests as “spontaneous” in reaction to the bill.  

Context & perspectives  
• Critics—particularly in Muslim-majority areas—fear that including non-Muslims in waqf management could expose properties (mosques, shrines, graveyards, shops, land) to confiscation or demolition.  
• The BJP frames the amendments as anti-corruption and pro-transparency.  
• Muslims make up about 15% of India’s 1.4 billion people; secular guarantees cited by opponents.  
• Observers note that religious polarisation under Prime Minister Modi has delivered electoral gains for the BJP.

<Summary source="https://www.siasat.com/watch-lights-out-in-hyderabad-against-waqf-amendment-act-3214679/">
Article summary (The Siasat Daily, April 30, 2025)  
Disclaimer: Extraction appears complete based on provided text.  

1. Protest overview  
• Date & format: On April 30, 2025, from 9:00 to 9:15 pm, participants across India switched off lights of homes and businesses (“15-minute lights-out”) in a silent protest.  
• Organiser: All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB).  
• Participation: Major support in Hyderabad (led visibly by AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi), and reported visuals from Old Delhi, Parbani (Maharashtra), Bihar and other cities.  
• Context: AIMPLB had paused its campaign for three days (starting April 23) in solidarity with Pahalgam terror attack victims.  

2. Protest aims & grievances  
• Target: The Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, passed by Parliament and assented April 6, 2025.  
• AIMPLB warning (named source): The amendments could strip Muslims of control over waqf properties—mosques, dargahs, charitable institutions and lands—by permitting their conversion into private or government property.  
• Legal concerns (named sources & claims):  
  – Alleged violation of Supreme Court’s “once Waqf, always Waqf” principle.  
  – Infringement of constitutional Article 26 (right of religious denominations to manage affairs, including property).  
  – Government funding of religious institutions (like mosques, madrasas, graveyards) is barred under the Constitution; waqf properties historically served this role.  

3. Key statements  
• AIMPLB spokesperson SQR Ilyas: The “lights out” programme, though symbolic, “will serve as a powerful expression of protest by the country’s Muslims and all justice-loving people, united against these dark amendments.”  
• Article commentary (author’s framing): The new law “goes against the grain of the Indian Constitution” and “militates against” the Supreme Court’s pronouncements.  
• Specific legal changes noted:  
  – Requirement that the Waqf Board CEO be Muslim has been removed.  
  – Two non-Muslims must now be appointed to the Central Waqf Council, State Waqf Boards and Waqf Tribunals.  
  – Compared to recent Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) Trust decision to terminate all non-Hindu employees.  

4. Supporting visuals and social-media posts (less authoritative sources)  
• The Siasat Daily (@TheSiasatDaily): tweeted protest footage.  
• Syed Abdahu Kashaf (@SyedAKashafQ): “Hyderabad stands strong Against #Waqf Amendment Act… switched off lights for 15 minutes… Our voice will not be silenced.”  
• Irfan Khan (@IrfanKhanhyd): shopkeepers in Abids market joined “BATTI GUL” blackout.  
• Anwarul_mla1: shared visuals from Old Delhi, Parbani, Bihar.

Here is a concise summary of the Scroll.in article (April 6, 2025) by Scroll Staff:

Facts and events  
• Over 300 residents of Muzaffarnagar district (Uttar Pradesh) received notices asking them to appear before a magistrate and each furnish a bond of ₹2 lakh.  
• The notices relate to a silent protest—wearing black armbands during Alvida Jummah prayers on March 28—against the 2024 Waqf Amendment Bill.  
• President Droupadi Murmu gave assent to the Waqf Bill in early April 2025; it had been passed by the Rajya Sabha on a Friday and the Lok Sabha two days earlier.  
• The 2024 Bill amends 44 sections of the 1995 Waqf Act (e.g., allowing non-Muslims on waqf boards, restricting property donations, changing tribunal procedures).  
• Notices were issued by City Magistrate Vikas Kashyap, citing a police report that the protesters “can disturb peace by inciting the general public.”  
• Those served must appear on April 16 at 10 am and show cause why they shouldn’t provide a ₹2 lakh surety “to maintain peace within this jurisdiction for a year.”  
• The protest was organized by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board.

Named official statements  
• Muzaffarnagar SP Satyanarayan Prajapat (via PTI):  
  – Notices served under Sections 126 and 135 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita as a “preventive and routine measure” to maintain law and order.  
  – The Alvida Jummah prayers “passed off peacefully,” and authorities are monitoring the situation in consultation with religious leaders.

Eyewitness and other sources  
• An unnamed participant (to The Times of India) said it was “only [a] silent protest—without sloganeering or posters—and such a step [issuing notices] was unfair.”  
• Unidentified police officers told The Times of India that protesters were identified via CCTV footage and local intelligence.  
• Mohammad Shibli (participant) said they wore ribbons per the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s call, entered the mosque silently, and then went home—“How can they call us disruptors of peace?”

# Major Protests in India Since 2000: A Chronological Analysis of Mass Mobilizations  

India has witnessed numerous large-scale protests since 2000, reflecting diverse socio-political grievances. Below is a detailed examination of demonstrations with at least 10,000 participants, organized chronologically and analyzed through documented facts.  

---

## 1. **2006 Anti-Reservation Protests**

---

## 4. **2015 FTII Agitation**  
**Dates**: June 2015–October 2015  
**Cause**: Opposition to the politically motivated appointment of Gajendra Chauhan as chairman of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII).

**Participants**: Approximately 200,000 protesters occupied Chennai’s Marina Beach, with similar demonstrations in Madurai and Coimbatore. The state government eventually legalized the sport under public pressure[9].  

---

## 6. **2019–2020 Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) Protests**  
**Dates**: December 2019–February 2020  
**Cause**: Opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), perceived as discriminatory against Muslims.  
**Participants**:  
- **Shaheen Bagh Sit-In**: Over 10,000 women staged a 101-day occupation in Delhi[1].  
- **Kochi Rally**: 500,000 protesters on 1 January 2020[1].  
- **Hyderabad Million March**: 100,000 participants on 4 January 2020[1].  
- **Delhi Violence**: Clashes in February 2020 led to 53 deaths and internet shutdowns[1][6].  

---

## 7. **2020–2021 Farmers’ Protests**  
**Dates**: November 2020–December 2021  
**Cause**: Rejection of three farm laws deregulating agricultural markets, feared to disadvantage small farmers.  
**Participants**:  
- **Delhi Border Blockades**: 300,000 farmers camped at Singhu and Tikri borders for over a year[2][7].  
- **Republic Day Tractor Rally**: 200,000 tractors breached Delhi’s Red Fort on 26 January 2021[7][14].  
- **General Strike**: 250 million workers joined a nationwide strike on 26 November 2020, the largest coordinated labor action globally[12].  

---

## 8. **2024 Farmers’ March**  
**Dates**: February 2024  
**Cause**: Renewed demands for legal guarantees of minimum support prices (MSP) for crops.  
**Participants**: Thousands mobilized from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, met with police barricades, tear gas, and internet shutdowns at Delhi’s borders[16].  

---

## Analysis of State Responses  
- **Internet Shutdowns**: Deployed during CAA protests (2019–2020) and farmer mobilizations (2020–2024) to disrupt organizing[1][16].  
- **Legal Repression**: Activists like Disha Ravi (2021) faced sedition charges for supporting farmer protests, highlighting systemic censorship[15].  
- **Violence**: Police firing killed 3 protesters in Mangalore (2019)[1], while the 2020 Delhi riots saw 53 fatalities[1].  

---

## Conclusion  
India’s protest landscape since 2000 reveals a pattern of mass mobilization against perceived legislative overreach, cultural erosion, and economic inequality. While these movements have driven policy changes—such as the Jallikattu legalization and farm law repeal—state responses often prioritize suppression over dialogue, perpetuating cycles of unrest. The interplay between grassroots activism and digital organizing (e.g., Trolley Times during farmer protests[5]) underscores evolving resistance tactics in the face of escalating repression.</Perplexity_report>

Summary of “Thane school parents protest over 10,000 ‘facility fee’ hike” by Manoj Badgeri (Apr 26, 2025)

• What happened: On Friday, parents of students at Shri Mavli Mandal High School, Charai (Thane), staged a protest outside the campus.  
• Issue: The school abruptly imposed a new annual “facility fee” of Rs 10,000 per student to cover installation of digital classroom boards.  
• Parents’ complaints:
  – They had already absorbed a 15% tuition-fee hike last academic year and rejected this additional charge as “unjust.”  
  – Some were threatened that their children might be barred from next year’s classes; marksheets of a few students were withheld until parents signed written fee-payment commitments.  
• Political support: Maharashtra Legislative Council member Niranjan Davkhare publicly backed the parents.  
• Next steps: Thane’s district education officer has summoned a meeting next week with school officials and parent representatives to address the dispute.

  – Failing to hold promised talks with farmers over the past year.  
  – Favoring industrialists’ interests over farmers’ land and water needs.  

Government claims vs. farmers’ counterpoints  
• Government: Highway will boost religious tourism.  
• Farmers: Priority is water access; they see little benefit to local communities, suspect the project serves industry.

Background context  
• Initial project suspension before assembly elections due to Kolhapur & Sangli farmers’ agitation.  
• Resumption under CM Fadnavis triggered renewed large-scale protest planning.

Here’s a concise summary of the AP News article “Cory Booker’s speech in protest of Trump breaks the Senate record,” including the other items it compiled:

Main story – Booker’s record-setting speech  
• New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker spoke continuously on the Senate floor for 25 hours 5 minutes, breaking Strom Thurmond’s 68-year-old record of 24 hours 18 minutes (Senate records).  
• He began Monday evening, saying he’d stay “as long as physically able” to protest President Trump’s agenda, and ended at 8:05 p.m. Tuesday amid applause when Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced the new record.  
• Fellow Democrats helped sustain him by interjecting questions. Booker’s stunt was intended as a show of Democratic resistance to Trump’s sweeping actions.

• Florida special election: Trump-backed Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis won a northwest Florida House seat over Democrat Gay Valimont, despite being heavily outraised. He fills the vacancy left by Matt Gaetz. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)  
• Arrest statistics: The White House says U.S. arrests fell 14% in March from February (7,181 vs. 8,347), down 95% from 137,473 in March 2024; the daily average of 232 arrests is the lowest since 1967, attributed to tighter Mexican border enforcement and U.S. asylum limits under Biden and further Trump restrictions.  
• Florida legislature: Rep. Randy Fine (R-Palm Bay) defeated Democrat Josh Weil in a reliably conservative district, with endorsements from Trump and former Rep. Mike Waltz.  
• Democratic messaging: House Leader Hakeem Jeffries declared “We are standing together against the GOP tax scam,” and Schumer called Booker a “tour de force” in blocking Trump’s agenda.  
• Media teasers: TV host Bill Maher posted on X that he’ll reveal details of a recent dinner with Trump on his April 11 show; Kid Rock offered to help arrange such a meeting.  
• Immigration report: A major Catholic/evangelical coalition estimates up to 10 million Christian immigrants—about 4 in 5 facing deportation—are at risk. “Though we’re deeply concerned about fellow Christians, we’re not exclusively concerned with immigrants who happen to share our faith,” said Matthew Soerens of World Relief.  
• Elon Musk on Wisconsin: In a Fox News interview, he warned that a state Supreme Court judge race could decide whether Democrats can gerrymander and urged viewers to mobilize “right now.”  
• TikTok meeting: President Trump plans a Wednesday meeting with aides on potential investors to stave off a U.S. ban on TikTok, per an anonymous source.

<Summary source="https://www.britannica.com/event/Jallianwala-Bagh-Massacre">
Here is a concise summary of the Britannica article on the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre:

• Date & place: On April 13, 1919, in Amritsar’s Jallianwala Bagh (a walled garden with a single exit), British troops under Brig. Gen. Reginald Dyer opened fire on a gathering of at least 10,000 unarmed men, women, and children.  
• Context:  
  – During World War I the British Indian government had imposed repressive emergency measures.  
  – After the war, instead of easing restrictions as hoped, it enacted the 1919 Rowlatt Acts, extending those powers.  
  – Gandhi called a one-day general strike in early April. In Amritsar, arrests of local leaders on April 10 sparked violent clashes in which soldiers fired on civilians.  
  – Dyer subsequently banned public assemblies and on April 13 ordered his troops to seal the Bagh’s exit and fire without warning.  
• Shooting: Troops reportedly fired some 1,650 rounds until they exhausted their ammunition. Official figures estimate 379 killed and about 1,200 wounded, though exact numbers are uncertain.  
• Aftermath in India:  
  – Martial law was imposed in Punjab, enforced through floggings and other punishments.  
  – Indian outrage spread nationwide. Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced his knighthood. Gandhi launched the noncooperation movement (1920–22).  
  – The 1920 Hunter Commission censured Dyer and forced his resignation.  
• Reaction in Britain:  
  – Sir Winston Churchill condemned Dyer’s actions in the House of Commons.  
  – The House of Lords, by contrast, praised Dyer and presented him a commemorative sword; private sympathizers also raised a fund for him.  
• Memorial: The Jallianwala Bagh site is now a national monument with preserved bullet-marked walls, the “Martyrs’ Well,” museum galleries, and a daily light-and-sound show.

**France Prepares for May 1st Protests, Dissolves Extremist Groups**
The French government is preparing for the May 1st protests, expecting between 100,000 to 150,000 participants. To prevent potential violence, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has announced the dissolution of several groups, including Urgence Palestine, Lyon Populaire (an ultraright group), and the Jeune Garde (an antifascist group). Retailleau stated, 'We will not tolerate any violence, and we will intervene at the slightest sign of it.' The government has also implemented a specific security plan for the protests in Narbonne, including a 'perimeter of protection' and 'risks of intrusion and perturbations.' Additionally, the government has banned the overflight of the city of Narbonne by aircraft without crew on board. Last year, 121,000 people protested on May 1st in France, with 18,000 in Paris, and 12,000 police and gendarmes were deployed, including 5,000 in the capital.

**Massive Protest in Bangladesh in Support of Gaza**
A massive protest of over 20 million people took place in Bangladesh on Saturday, according to the Palestinian news agency Safa. The protesters gathered in the Suhrawardy Garden and surrounding areas, waving Palestinian flags and chanting slogans such as 'Free Palestine'. The protesters highlighted the atrocities committed against Palestinian civilians, including children, youth, and elderly, by carrying symbolic coffins representing the victims of Israeli attacks. The protesters also accused US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of supporting the Israeli enemy. It is worth noting that Bangladesh, with a population of over 170 million, mostly Muslim, does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. This protest comes in support of the Palestinian people, who have been subjected to a genocide by Israel since October 7, 2023, resulting in over 166,000 martyrs and wounded, mostly children and women, and over 11,000 missing.

**Mass protests in Bangladesh against Israeli attacks on Gaza - The Times of India**
Mass protests broke out across Bangladesh, including Dhaka city, in response to Israeli actions in Gaza. The demonstrations, which included students, workers, and professionals, were part of worldwide protests against attacks on Palestinians. The Government of Bangladesh condemned the Israeli actions, stating that they have 'shown no regard to repeated international appeals and have instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree.' Protesters also voiced opposition to American support for Israel's Gaza offensive and criticized the inaction of bodies like the UN, OIC, and Arab League. According to Gaza authorities, 57 people died and 137 were wounded in the past 24 hours, with a total of 50,752 casualties and 115,475 injuries since October 7, 2023. Protesters also opposed American plans to relocate Palestinians for Gaza's reconstruction, terming it 'ethnic cleansing.'

**Belgrade's Rabbit: A Symbol of the Largest Protest Movement in Serbia's Recent History**
Protests in Serbia in 2025 have become one of the most significant public movements in the country in recent decades. They began in November 2024 after a tragedy in Novi Sad, where a concrete roof collapsed at a railway station, killing 15 people. This event sparked widespread resonance, as many linked it to corruption and negligence by authorities during the reconstruction of the object. Since then, protests, initially organized by students, have grown into a mass movement, involving various layers of the population, from teachers and farmers to bikers and social service employees. The main demands of the protesters include the resignation of President Alexander Vucic, punishment for those responsible for the tragedy, fighting systemic corruption, and ensuring transparency in the management of the country. The culmination was a rally on March 15, 2025, in Belgrade, which, according to various estimates, gathered from 100,000 to over 500,000 people, making it one of the largest protest actions in the history of modern Serbia. Participants gathered in front of the parliament building, and columns of protesters, including farmers on tractors, arrived from different parts of the country. Despite the peaceful nature of most actions, there have been reports of clashes with the police and possible use of sound weapons, which the authorities deny. The protests have already led to significant consequences: in January 2025, Prime Minister Milos Vucic resigned, but the protesters continue to insist on systemic changes. Vucic, in turn, compares what is happening to attempts at a 'color revolution' and insists that power will only change through elections. However, the movement does not lose its strength, and many experts predict further escalation of the political crisis in the country.

**Kshatriya Mahasabha and Karani Sena Announce Massive Protest in Agra**
The Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha and Karani Sena have announced a massive protest in Agra on April 12, in response to Samajwadi Party leader Ramjilal Suman's comments on Rana Sanga. The protest will be a march of thousands of people, with participants riding on vehicles. The protesters claim that Suman's comments were an insult to Indian heroes and that they will not be tolerated. They have also thanked BSP supremo Mayawati for condemning Suman's comments. Karani Sena's national vice-president Mukes Raval said that the protesters will not tolerate any insult to the heroes who gave their lives to protect India from the Mughals. The protesters have also announced that they will participate in the 'Rakta Swabhiman Rally' on April 12, along with the Rashtriya Swarna Parishad, which will bring 5,000 people together. The protesters have called on people to join the rally in large numbers to celebrate the birth anniversary of Maharana Sanga on April 12.

**Srbian Maidaun: Protests in Belgrade May Turn into a Real Political Revolution**
A major political crisis is unfolding in Serbia, with mass protests in Belgrade against President Alexander Vucic on March 15. According to estimates, between 107,000 and 1 million people participated in the demonstration, which was the culmination of ongoing protests since November. The protests were sparked by a tragedy in Novi Sad, where a roof collapse at a train station killed 15 people. Protesters are demanding accountability and punishment for those responsible, and are also calling for Vucic's resignation. The event was largely peaceful, but some incidents occurred, including a car crashing into the crowd and injuring three people. Later, protesters used pyrotechnics and smoke bombs. During a 15-minute moment of silence, the crowd panicked, allegedly due to a 'sound cannon', although the Serbian Ministry of Interior denies this. The protests have already led to the resignation of the prime minister and the mayor of Novi Sad. Vucic claims to have heard the people's message, but says that power will only change through elections. If a new government is not formed by April 18, early parliamentary elections will be held on June 8. Experts believe that the protests will continue, but their scale may decrease. However, if the country goes to early elections, the protest movement may gain political strength, as stated by 'We have to be careful, because if we go to early elections, the protest movement can acquire a political force.' said, 'Sergey Samsonov, a political analyst.'

**Serbia's Mass Protests: A Complex and Paradoxical Situation**
Mass protests took place in Serbia on March 15, 2025, which could have completely changed the perception of the capital city, Belgrade, as a comfortable and peaceful place. According to official information, 56 people were injured and 22 arrested during the protests. President Alexander Vucic stated that there were no fatalities or seriously injured individuals. The arrested individuals are suspected of crimes against property, attacks on police officers, and other individuals. Vucic expressed pride in the actions of the law enforcement agencies that maintained order during the protests and denied the use of batons and sound grenades. The protests were sparked by a tragic event in the second-largest city in the country, Novi Sad, where a recently renovated train station collapsed, killing 15 people. This event was used by opposition political forces, non-governmental organizations, and student movements to mobilize supporters for public actions against the current president and government. As one walked through the center of Belgrade on March 15, it was impossible to shake off the feeling of déjà vu, reminiscent of similar events in other countries, particularly Ukraine in 2013-2014. The protests gathered a large number of people, with estimates ranging from 107,000 to 1 million, with the most realistic figure being around 200,000. The protests were not limited to students, as initially claimed, but involved people of all age groups and social backgrounds. Some participants even brought small children, seemingly unaware of the potential consequences of provocation. The protests were accompanied by traditional 'color revolution' sounds, including drumbeats, whistles, and vuvuzelas, which can have a significant impact on the psyche. The organizers claimed that the incidents were minor and isolated, but it is clear that the situation could have been escalated with the use of tear gas or explosives to create victims and a pretext for confrontation with law enforcement. Additionally, a 'Maidan' emerged, consisting of dozens of activists on vehicles, creating activity in remote locations. As the night fell, groups of people continued to exert pressure on police officers guarding government buildings, and activists began to disperse the crowd or create local rallies. The paradox of the situation is that no one can clearly explain why these protests are necessary and what drives their organizers. It seems that people are taking to the streets 'for all that is good and against all that is bad,' without thinking about the potential consequences for the country. As a result, the authorities have partially met the protesters' demands by publishing documentation on the reconstruction of the train station and detaining several officials. However, the protests continue, and it is unclear whether these actions can effectively influence the situation or simply destroy what already exists.

**Massive Anti-Corruption Protest Rocks Belgrade**
A massive human tide marched through the streets of Belgrade, Serbia on March 15, 2025, in a historic anti-corruption protest led by determined Serbian students who chanted 'Pompe! Pompe!' and waved flags and banners from the far-right to the far-left. Between 275,000 and 325,000 people participated, according to independent estimates, making it the largest protest since President Aleksandar Vucic came to power a decade ago and one of the largest in modern Serbian history. The government had previously estimated 107,000 participants. The movement, sparked by the November 1 accident at the Novi Sad train station that killed 15 people, has been gaining momentum for weeks, with daily protests demanding accountability for the accident, the release of arrested protesters, and a less corrupt system. As one student said, 'Nous nous sommes organisés à partir de rien et avons accompli beaucoup de choses' ('We organized from scratch and accomplished a lot'). The protesters, who included people of all ages and backgrounds, were peaceful and responsible, following the students' call to 'manifester dans le calme et de façon responsable' ('manifest peacefully and responsibly'). The protest was secured by a network of motorcyclists, veterans, and student security groups, who formed a safety net around the procession. The students had warned against using the movement for violent or revolutionary purposes, and their message was heeded by the crowd. The protesters dispersed peacefully at 9 PM, and President Vucic expressed satisfaction that the protest passed without serious incidents or injuries.

**Serbia's Opposition Claims Over a Million Protesters in Belgrade, Authorities See Color Revolution**
The opposition in Serbia claims that over a million people participated in a protest in Belgrade, while the authorities see it as a sign of a color revolution. According to the opposition, the protest was a peaceful demonstration, but the authorities have taken a hardline stance. Serbian President Alexander Vucic has described the protest as 'not a rally, but a revolution.' The opposition's claim of a million participants is disputed, as the city of Belgrade has a population of 2.8 million people, according to the 2022 census. The protest is the latest in a series of mass demonstrations in Serbia, which have been ongoing since 2023.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

**Carnegie Endowment article (2024)**: Credible source documenting global protest trends through their Global Protest Tracker (our resolution source). It identifies four categories of protests that occurred in India during 2024: anti-government actions, Israel-Hamas related, economic protests (specifically labor code changes), and workers' actions (including farmers). No specific participation numbers provided.

**Amnesty International report**: Respected human rights organization documenting state responses to protests globally. Notes India specifically used "guns, tear gas, baton charges, internet shutdowns, forced evictions" against protesters. Credible for documenting government tactics but doesn't provide protest size data.

**Al Jazeera article "Mapping major protests"**: Contains valuable quantitative data, noting ~900 global protests with 10,000+ participants between 2010-2020. Specifically mentions 2,800 farmer protests in India since August 2020, including one general strike claimed to have 250 million participants (November 2020). Reliable international news source providing factual context.

**Al Jazeera article (April 2025)**: Recent reporting on Waqf Amendment Bill protests resulting in three deaths and 150+ arrests in West Bengal. Includes statements from named officials (BSF Inspector General, opposition leaders, Chief Minister). Indicates ongoing religious tensions without specifying protest sizes.

**Siasat Daily article (April 30, 2025)**: Reports on nationwide 15-minute symbolic "lights out" protest against Waqf Amendment Act. Quotes AIMPLB spokesperson on protest aims. Indicates widespread but diffuse participation rather than concentrated gatherings of 10,000+.

**Scroll.in article (April 6, 2025)**: Describes legal notices to protesters in UP following silent Waqf Bill protests. Contains named official statements (SP Prajapat) confirming this was a "preventive measure." Shows authorities' preemptive actions against potential larger mobilizations.

**Perplexity report**: Comprehensive chronology of major Indian protests since 2000 with 10,000+ participants. Key recent examples include CAA protests (2019-2020) with multiple events exceeding 10,000 participants, farmer protests (2020-2021) with hundreds of thousands of participants, and February 2024 farmers' march (thousands). Valuable for establishing frequency and scale patterns.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several reference classes can be considered:

1. **Large protests in India since 2000**: The Perplexity report identifies 8 major protest movements exceeding 10,000 participants in 24 years, averaging one every 3 years.

2. **Religious/identity-based protests in India**: The CAA protests (2019-2020) generated multiple gatherings over 10,000 participants, showing capacity for identity-based mobilization.

3. **Recent Waqf Amendment Act protests (2025)**: Already generating nationwide participation but not yet documented at 10,000+ scale.

The most appropriate reference class is large protests in India since 2000, with special consideration for the active Waqf Amendment Act protests that began in April 2025.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

We have approximately 2 months from today (May 2, 2025) until the resolution date (July 1, 2025).

Historical patterns show:
- Major Indian protests typically develop over weeks or months
- The Waqf Amendment Act was passed in early April 2025, with protests already spreading nationwide within weeks
- Symbolic "lights out" protest occurred very recently (April 30, 2025), indicating growing rather than diminishing momentum
- May-June represents pre-monsoon summer, which can affect outdoor gatherings due to heat but hasn't historically prevented large protests around compelling issues

## (d) Justification:

The recent Waqf Amendment Act protests present the most likely pathway to a 10,000+ participant gathering within our timeframe. Several factors support this possibility:

1. **Growing momentum**: The progression from localized protests in early April to nationwide symbolic action by April 30 shows increasing coordination.

2. **Demographic significance**: The issue directly concerns India's Muslim community (approximately 15% of 1.4 billion people, or 210 million citizens).

3. **Multiple protest hubs**: Sources mention protest activity across multiple states (West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad, Delhi), increasing the chances of at least one location gathering 10,000+ participants.

4. **Historical precedent**: Previous religious identity-based protests (CAA) exceeded the 10,000-participant threshold, and the Waqf Amendment Act similarly touches on religious identity concerns.

5. **Organizational backing**: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is actively coordinating protest efforts, providing institutional support for larger mobilizations.

The primary countervailing factor is government opposition, with authorities already issuing preventive notices and deploying security forces in some locations.

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I'll start with the baseline rate from our reference class: 8 major protests over 24 years suggests approximately 1 protest every 3 years (33% annual probability). For a 2-month period, this would normally translate to roughly 5-6% chance.

However, current conditions substantially increase this probability:

1. An active protest movement against the Waqf Amendment Act is already underway nationwide.

2. The issue directly affects India's 210 million Muslims, providing a large potential participant base.

3. Previous identity-based protests (CAA) reached similar scale, establishing precedent.

4. The protest movement is showing signs of growth rather than decline (nationwide action on April 30).

5. Multiple protest locations increase the chance that at least one will reach 10,000+ participants.

6. The issue has generated documented fatalities (3 deaths in West Bengal), potentially escalating emotions and participation.

7. The 2-month window provides sufficient time for further mobilization, especially with organized backing from AIMPLB.

Considering these factors, I assess a significantly higher probability than the baseline.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Carnegie Endowment article (2024)**: 
   This credible source documents global protest trends from 2024, specifically mentioning India experiencing protests over alleged abuse of power, new labor codes, and farming issues. While it doesn't provide participant numbers for Indian protests, it establishes that India has experienced various types of recent protests. As the creator of the Global Protest Tracker referenced in our question, this source holds particular relevance.

2. **Amnesty International Press Release**: 
   This established human rights organization highlights India among 86 countries with credible allegations of unlawful force against protesters, noting specific tactics including "guns, tear gas, baton charges, internet shutdowns, and forced evictions." While factual in its reporting of incidents, it doesn't provide concrete data on protest sizes in India.

3. **Al Jazeera article (2021) "Mapping major protests"**: 
   This source provides valuable quantitative data: approximately 900 global protests with 10,000+ participants occurred between 2010-2020, with India featuring prominently. It cites the Mass Mobilisation Data Project and ACLED as primary sources. Key factual data includes 2,800 farmer protests in India since August 2020 and a claimed 250 million participants in a 2020 general strike. Though older, this article establishes India's capacity for large-scale mobilization.

4. **Al Jazeera article (April 2025) on Waqf bill protests**: 
   This timely source documents ongoing protests against the federal Waqf Amendment Bill that resulted in three deaths and over 150 arrests in Murshidabad district. Multiple named officials provide factual statements, including BSF Inspector General Karni Singh confirming troop deployments. While no protest size is specified, it establishes very recent civil unrest around religious issues.

5. **The Siasat Daily article (April 30, 2025)**: 
   This extremely recent article documents a nationwide "lights-out" protest against the Waqf Amendment Act, with named sources including AIMPLB spokesperson SQR Ilyas. While primarily symbolic rather than a mass gathering, it demonstrates continued organized opposition to the Act. No participant counts are provided.

6. **Scroll.in article (April 6, 2025)**: 
   This credible source details legal notices issued to 300+ Muzaffarnagar district residents following a silent protest against the Waqf Bill. It includes statements from official sources including SP Satyanarayan Prajapat. This establishes government concern about potential escalation of these protests.

7. **Perplexity report on major Indian protests**: 
   This compilation provides a chronological history of major Indian protests, extracting data from multiple sources. It documents numerous protests exceeding 10,000 participants, including the CAA protests (2019-2020) with specific numbers (Shaheen Bagh: 10,000+; Kochi: 500,000; Hyderabad: 100,000) and the 2020-2021 Farmers' Protests (300,000 at Delhi borders). Recent farmer protests from February 2024 are also noted, though without specific numbers.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several potential reference classes emerge:

1. **Large protests in India (2019-2025)**: The most directly relevant class, showing 3-4 distinct protest movements with 10,000+ participants in the past 5-6 years (CAA protests, Farmers' protests, 2024 Farmers' march).

2. **Religious/identity-based protests in India**: Particularly relevant given the current Waqf Amendment Act protests. The 2019-2020 CAA protests mobilized hundreds of thousands over perceived discrimination against Muslims.

3. **Frequency of protests reported by Global Protest Tracker in India**: The most precise reference class, but data limitations exist.

The most suitable reference class appears to be large protests in India from 2019-2025, with particular attention to the current religious-identity tensions around the Waqf Amendment Act, which affects India's 210 million Muslims (15% of population).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Our prediction window is May 2 to July 1, 2025 (approximately 60 days). Key temporal considerations:

- India has experienced 3-4 major protest movements exceeding 10,000 participants in the past 5-6 years
- The current Waqf Amendment Act issue is still developing, with documented protests on March 28, April 6, April 13, and April 30, 2025
- The Act recently took effect in April 2025, suggesting opposition may be building rather than diminishing
- Protest escalation patterns often involve increasing mobilization following government suppression (already observed with arrests and paramilitary deployment)
- May-June period in India features extremely hot weather, potentially affecting outdoor gatherings

## (d) Justification

The analysis strongly suggests a substantial probability of a 10,000+ participant protest in India being reported by the Global Protest Tracker before July 1, 2025:

1. The Waqf Amendment Act represents a significant flashpoint affecting 210 million Muslims in India, a population base where mobilizing 10,000 people represents just 0.005% of the affected community.

2. Current protests are displaying signs of escalation: from symbolic actions (black armbands, lights-out) to confrontational demonstrations resulting in deaths and arrests in West Bengal.

3. India has demonstrated repeated capacity for large-scale mobilization in recent years, with multiple movements exceeding 10,000 participants since 2019.

4. The current protests span multiple cities (documented in Hyderabad, Old Delhi, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal), increasing the likelihood that at least one gathering will reach the 10,000 threshold.

5. Government responses (legal notices, paramilitary deployment) often catalyze larger protests rather than suppressing them, particularly on issues of religious identity.

6. The Act just took effect in April 2025, placing us at the early stage of potential protest escalation.

Counterbalancing these factors are the short timeframe (60 days), potential deterrent effects of government action, and the possible preference for distributed rather than mass actions as seen in the recent "lights-out" protest.

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I consider:

1. The historical frequency of 10,000+ participant protests in India (3-4 in the past 5-6 years) suggests approximately 60-80% chance of one occurring in any given year.

2. The 60-day prediction window represents about 16% of a year, which would normally reduce the probability significantly.

3. However, the Waqf Amendment Act represents an active, ongoing issue with demonstrated protest activity across multiple cities and affects 210 million people.

4. Muslim religious identity issues have previously generated some of India's largest protests (CAA protests with 100,000+ participants).

5. The timing immediately following implementation of a controversial law represents a high-risk period for large-scale mobilization.

6. For a protest to count, it must be captured by the specific Global Protest Tracker dataset, adding uncertainty.

Weighing these factors, with special emphasis on the active nature of the current protest movement and its similarity to previous large-scale religious identity protests, I estimate approximately 65% probability of a 10,000+ participant protest being reported by the Global Protest Tracker before July 1, 2025.

     • Content: Lists eight massive mobilizations—2006 anti-reservation, 2011 anti-corruption, 2012 Nirbhaya, 2015 FTII, 2017 pro-Jallikattu, 2019–20 CAA, 2020–21 farmers, 2024 farmers’ march. Participant estimates range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands or millions.  
     • Quality: Aggregates multiple sources (ACLED, trade unions, news outlets); some figures (e.g. 250 million) arguably hyperbolic, but all items are well-known, well-documented national movements.  
     • Relevance: Confirms that India averages roughly one major (>10,000 participants) mobilization per year on a new issue plus recurring waves on existing issues.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
  Candidate reference classes for “any protest in India >10,000 participants in the next X time” include:  
  • Class A: All protests >10k in India per year.  
     – Historical frequency: At least 5–8 distinct issue-based waves since 2000 (≈1 every 2–3 years), but many of these persist months at a time with multiple large gatherings.  
  • Class B: Protests >10k in democracies with similar population sizes (e.g. Brazil, Indonesia) over ~2 months.  
     – Less directly comparable since India’s protest culture and issue density are higher.  
  • Class C: Protests >10k in India per month.  
     – Using 2019–2021 as guide, major mobilizations spiked around single issues, not continuously every month. But peripheral protests (farmer enclaves, anti-labor code pickets) repeatedly drew >10k at multiple locations.  

  Most suitable: Class A, refined to “distinct issue-based mobilization waves in India.” Given that:  
  – From 2019–2022, we saw at least three high-visibility waves (CAA, farmers 2020–21, continued farmer agitations into 2022 and renewed in 2024).  
  – Even if no brand-new national issue arose in early 2025 beyond the Waqf Amendment fight, a farmer throwback or state election could trigger another >10k demonstration.

3. Timeframe analysis  
  • Time left until resolution: 60 days (May 2 to June 30, 2025).  
  • Historical pattern: Major waves often last 2–4 months from inception. The Waqf Amendment protests began April 2025; if they scale beyond symbolic or localized violence into street mobilizations, they could reach 10k in May or June.  
  • Other triggers in this window:  
    – State assembly elections in major states (e.g., West Bengal, Tamil Nadu) scheduled in May 2025—candidates and opposition often mobilize huge rallies.  
    – Anniversary of June 2024 Gaza protests and global solidarity days—India’s Muslim civil-society groups might mass-mobilize >10k.  
    – New labor-code implementation deadlines.  

4. Status quo and momentum  
  • India’s protest environment in 2025 remains heated: religious, agrarian, labor, and civil-liberties groups all have active campaigns.  
  • Government response has been mixed—tolerant of occasional large rallies but quick to shut down continuous encampments. Still, periodic big demonstrations slip through before clampdowns intensify.  

Justification for Outside View Prediction  
  • India’s baseline rate of protests >10,000 participants is at least one substantial wave every 12–18 months, with each wave comprising multiple events.  
  • Currently active protests (Waqf Amendment) and upcoming electoral and labor deadlines provide at least two credible mobilization catalysts.  
  • With 60 days left, the conditional probability that one of these catalysts yields a 10,000+ crowd is very high.  
  • Even if Waqf Amendment protests remain mostly symbolic, separate mobilizations—state-election rallies or farmers’ or labor groups—are almost certain to clear the threshold.  

Outside view calibration:  
  – If India sees on average 1–2 “major” protest waves per year, each wave containing multiple >10k events, the implied monthly chance is roughly 10–15% for at least one >10k event (1.2–1.8 per year ÷ 12 months).  
  – For 2 months, naïve compound gives 1 – (1 – 0.125)^2 ≈ 0.24, but this undercounts clustering during active periods. We know 2025 is active.  
  – Adjusting for heightened activism around recent Waqf protests and impending elections, multiply baseline by factor ≈4 for these 2 months. That yields ≈0.24×4 = 0.96.  
  – Allowing for some chance both that the Waqf protests remain small and elections are low-turnout (unlikely), we trim back to ≈0.90–0.95.  

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 95% probability that the Global Protest Tracker will report at least one protest in India with 10,000+ participants before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
  a. Carnegie Endowment “Election-Related Protests Surged in 2024”  
    • Type: Think-tank summary of Global Protest Tracker.  
    • Factual content: Describes global protest drivers in 2024, including some Indian protests (over new labor codes, alleged power abuse). No specific crowd-size figures for India.  
    • Reliability: High for event identification, moderate for quantities (no 10k+ counts for India). Opinion-lite.  
  b. Amnesty International “Protect the Protest” map (Sept 2023)  
    • Type: NGO report on protest repression, not on crowd sizes. Notes India’s use of force/internet shutdowns.  
    • Reliability: High for methodology on rights violations, low relevance for 10k+ mobilization frequency.  
  c. Al Jazeera “Mapping major protests around the world” (Mar 2021)  
    • Type: Journalistic summary of multi-source data (Mass Mobilisation Data Project, ACLED).  
    • Facts: Globally ~900 protests ≥10k (2010–2020); ACLED records 2,800 farmer protests in India since Aug 2020; 250 million in 2020 general strike claim.  
    • Quality: Good for global benchmarks; India-specific large events listed (e.g. 2020 farmer highways blockade, general strike) but no systematic annual count of ≥10k events.  
  d. Al Jazeera “Waqf bill protests” (Apr 2025)  
    • Type: News dispatch.  
    • Facts: Protests in Murshidabad → 3 dead, 150+ arrested. No crowd-size ≥10k.  
    • Quality: High on arrests/deaths; no size data.  
  e. The Siasat Daily “Lights out in Hyderabad” (Apr 30, 2025)  
    • Type: Regional press.  
    • Facts: Silent “lights-out” protest in multiple cities, no participant-count.  
    • Quality: Adequate for format, not for scale.  
  f. Scroll.in “₹2 lakh bond notices in UP” (Apr 6, 2025)  
    • Type: Indian online media.  
    • Facts: 300 people served notices for wearing black armbands. Scale well below 10k.  
    • Quality: Good for local enforcement detail, irrelevant for large-scale mobilizations.  
  g. Perplexity_report “Major Protests in India Since 2000”  
    • Type: Aggregated model summary of media and datasets.  
    • Facts: Lists roughly one ≥10k protest every 1–2 years (anti-reservation 2006; anti-corruption 2011; Nirbhaya 2012; FTII 2015; Jallikattu 2017; CAA 2019–20; Farmers 2020–21; Farmers redux 2024).  
    • Quality: Useful as a rough catalogue, but crowd-size estimates sometimes unverified (e.g. “millions”).  

2. Reference-class analysis  
  Possible classes:  
    • Global frequency of protests ≥10k (900 in 10 years → 90/year). Too broad, underweights India’s high social mobilization.  
    • India-specific history of protests ≥10k by year (Perplexity: ~1–2 large protests per year in last decade). Best fit: India’s year-to-year count of ≥10k mobilizations.  
    • Election-year spikes in India (elections in 2024 saw scattered demonstrations but no single ≥10k event recorded on GPT after mid-2024).  
  Chosen reference class: Annual count of distinct India protests with ≥10,000 participants over the past 5 years (~2/year).  

3. Timeframe analysis  
  • Current date: May 2, 2025. Resolution window closes July 1, 2025 → 60 days.  
  • Historical pattern: If India averages ~2 large protests per 12 months, then per-day hazard ~2/365 ≈0.0055. Over 60 days cumulative P ≈1 – exp(–0.0055×60) ≈0.29.  
  • Seasonality: Large mobilizations often align with political flashpoints (national elections, budget announcements, anniversary dates). May–June lacks major national trigger unless legislation (e.g. Waqf Bill backlash) suddenly scales up. We should discount by perhaps half for “off-peak” months → ~0.15.  

4. Justification  
  • Baseline (outside view) uses India’s typical rate of protests ≥10k: ~2/year.  
  • Two-month window implies a non-trivial but not overwhelming probability.  
  • Current protest drivers: Waqf Amendment protests are ongoing but small (<10k). No credible planning for a 10k+ street mobilization has emerged.  
  • No major national or state elections or universal strikes scheduled in this period.  
  • Government’s strong preventive measures (bonds, internet shutdowns, rapid force deployments) further reduce the chance that spontaneous demonstrations cross the 10k threshold.  

Outside-view calibration:  
  • Base‐rate over 12 months ≈2 events → bi‐monthly uncontrolled hazard ≈29%.  
  • Seasonality and high state repression in recent months → downward adjustment to ≈15%.  
  • Aligns with intuition that a “Yes” outcome is possible but far from certain.  

Outside View Prediction:  
  Probability = 15%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Carnegie Endowment / Global Protest Tracker (GPT): Quantitative database that lists protest “episodes” worldwide that involve ≥10 000 participants, from 2017-present, with start-date, size band, issue, and country tags.  Factual, low-bias, clearly the adjudicating source for this question.  
• Carothers (2024) article on GPT trends: Secondary commentary summarising 2024 entries in GPT.  Facts (country, theme, date of entry) are reliable; thematic judgements (“surge”, “broad legitimacy challenges”) are opinion.  
• Amnesty map, Al-Jazeera 2021, 2025 Al-Jazeera (Waqf bill deaths), Siasat Daily lights-out piece, Scroll.in bond-notices article: all give factual snippets on Indian protest activity but none provides audited crowd-size figures; opinions are plentiful and come from politicians, activists, or reporters.  These are useful for flavour but not for counting GPT-qualifying events.  
• Perplexity report: Compiled list of Indian mass protests since 2000 with citations.  Good for back-of-envelope frequency estimation, but crowd-size numbers are drawn from heterogeneous media claims and are not harmonised with GPT coding rules.

(b) Reference class analysis  
RC-1 “Indian GPT entries (≥10 000 participants) per calendar year, 2017-2024”  
 • 2017 Gurjar & Dalit protests (1)  
 • 2018 National farmers’ march (1)  
 • 2019-20 CAA/NRC episodes (1)  
 • 2020-21 Farmers’ movement (1)  
 • 2022 Railway-exam recruitment protests (1)  
 • 2023 Wrestlers’ protest (1)  
 • 2024 “Farmers’ march 2.0” (1)  
Average ≈ 1.0 new GPT event per year.  
RC-2 “All GPT entries in large middle-income democracies (Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, South Africa)”: 0.7-1.2 per year each.  Similar rate; India is not an outlier.  
RC-3 “Indian protests of any size recorded by ACLED”: far larger count; not suitable (denominator too big, different coding rules).  
Chosen reference class: RC-1 (Indian GPT ≥10 k events per year) because it is exactly the data set that determines resolution.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today: 2 May 2025.  Window until 1 July 2025 = 60 days (≈0.166 yr).  
If the annual arrival rate λ ≈ 1.0, we treat events as a Poisson process.  
 P(at least one event in 60 days) = 1 – exp(–λ × 0.166)  
  = 1 – exp(–0.166) ≈ 1 – 0.847 ≈ 0.153 (15 %).  
Empirically, three of the seven Indian GPT events since 2017 started in the April-July quadrimester (2017 Gurjar, 2018 farmers’ Kisan Long March, 2021 Black Day in farmers’ protest), so no obvious seasonality penalty or boost is required.

(d) Justification / synthesis  
• Historical base-rate: ≈1 new GPT-qualifying protest per year → unconditional 15 % chance in a two-month slice.  
• Update lags: GPT often codes events weeks after they begin, so protests that start by late June still get captured. This does not change the probability but reassures that timing noise will not bias against a Yes resolution.  
• Current backdrop: The Waqf-Amendment agitation is active but, to date, reported turn-outs are localised (hundreds–low thousands).  No media source has yet claimed a 10 000+ rally; therefore I do not raise the base-rate.  
• Other latent triggers (inflation, heat-wave power cuts, unemployment, university exam leaks) are always present but rarely scale to 10 000+ within eight weeks without advance indicators.  No such indicators at the moment.  
• Election cycle: National elections were 2024; state polls resume late-2025.  Relative lull.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: Poisson estimate gives 15 %.  
• Uncertainty in λ (true mean 0.8-1.2) broadens the 95 % credible band to roughly 10 %-20 %.  
• Small meta-adjustments:  
 +1 ppt for under-reporting risk already baked into λ (GPT misses some events)  
 –1 ppt because only protests that START after question launch count (one additional filter).  
Net = 15 %.

Outside View Prediction:
15 % chance that the Global Protest Tracker will report at least one protest in India involving 10 000 + participants with a start-date between question launch and 30 June 2025.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Times of India (April 26, 2025)**: Recent article about a localized parents' protest at a Thane school over fee hikes. Reliable news source but describes a small-scale protest unlikely to reach 10,000 participants. Limited relevance to our question.

**Al Jazeera "Mapping major protests" article**: Provides valuable historical context, noting 900 global protests with 10,000+ participants between 2010-2020, including significant protests in India (particularly the 2020 farmers' protests with claimed participation of 250 million). High-quality international news source with factual reporting on protest trends.

**India Today (April 7, 2025)**: Recent article from major Indian news outlet about planned TMC protests against teacher job terminations. While participant numbers aren't specified, the scale of the issue (25,000 terminated teachers) suggests potential for large mobilization. High relevance as it reflects current political mobilization capacity.

**Free Press Journal (March 2025)**: Reports on planned 10,000-farmer march against highway project for March 12, starting from Azad Maidan, Mumbai. Explicit mention of expected 10,000 participants shows recent precedent for protests of this scale. Moderate relevance as it predates our current date but shows mobilization capacity.

**AP News (April 1, 2025)**: Primarily covers US political developments with minimal relevance to Indian protests. High credibility source but low relevance to our question.

**Britannica article on Jallianwala Bagh Massacre**: Historical context only, providing background on India's protest history but not current conditions. High credibility but low direct relevance.

**Asknews query results**: Despite specifically requesting articles about "India's recent mass protests since April 2025 with estimated 10,000 or more participants," results primarily focused on protests in France, Germany, and other countries. Some articles mention:
- Hindu groups protesting in US over Pahalgam attack (April 2025) that killed 26 people in India
- Bangladesh protests against Israeli actions in Gaza
- No clear evidence of recent Indian protests exceeding 10,000 participants

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence**:
- Historical precedent: Al Jazeera documents substantial history of large-scale protests in India, including farmer protests in 2020-2021 with extraordinary participation numbers
- Concrete planning: Free Press Journal reported planned 10,000-person farmer march in March 2025, showing organizational capacity for protests of this scale
- Active religious/identity issue: The Waqf Amendment Act passed in April 2025 has already generated nationwide protests according to current information, with the issue directly affecting India's Muslim population (210 million citizens)
- Institutional support: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is actively coordinating protest efforts

**Moderate evidence**:
- Multiple protest hubs: Sources mention Waqf Act protest activity across several states (West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad, Delhi)
- Growing momentum: Progression from localized protests to nationwide "lights out" symbolic action by April 30 shows coordination capacity
- Teachers' protest: TMC planning coordinated protests across West Bengal in April 2025 over 25,000 terminated positions

**Weak evidence**:
- Pahalgam attack: 26 people killed in April 2025, potentially triggering protests, but no evidence yet of large-scale mobilization within India
- Absence of recent reporting: Specific search for Indian protests with 10,000+ participants since April 2025 didn't return direct results

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

We have a 60-day window from today (May 2, 2025) to the resolution date (July 1, 2025).

This timeframe is:
- Long enough for protest movements to organize large gatherings, especially those already active
- Spans pre-monsoon season, when weather is hot but generally dry enough for outdoor gatherings
- Sufficient for the already-mobilizing Waqf Act protests to potentially reach critical mass

If the timeframe were halved (30 days), I would reduce my confidence significantly, as there would be less time for momentum to build to the 10,000+ threshold.

If doubled (120 days), I would increase confidence substantially, as it would span multiple potential trigger events and allow more time for organizing large-scale gatherings.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 71%, I need to consider whether current evidence warrants adjustment:

**Factors supporting high probability**:
1. Active nationwide protest movement against the Waqf Amendment Act with institutional backing
2. Issue directly affects 210 million Muslims, providing large potential participant base
3. Multiple protest hubs across several states increase chances of at least one location reaching 10,000+
4. Recent precedent (March 2025 planned 10,000-person farmer protest) demonstrates capacity
5. Additional issues (teacher terminations, Pahalgam attack) provide multiple potential triggers

**Factors suggesting moderation**:
1. Specific search for Indian protests with 10,000+ participants since April 2025 returned no clear results
2. Pre-monsoon heat (May-June) might slightly dampen outdoor participation
3. Current Waqf protests appear to have focused on symbolic actions rather than mass gatherings

While the active nationwide movement and multiple protest hubs support the high outside view probability, the lack of recent examples of protests reaching 10,000+ participants suggests a slightly more conservative adjustment is warranted.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view of 71%, I believe a modest downward adjustment to 65% is appropriate. This adjustment accounts for:

1. The absence of clear evidence of protests reaching 10,000+ participants in April/early May 2025, despite a specific search for such information.

2. The symbolic nature of the most recent Waqf Act protest (nationwide "lights out" on April 30) rather than large physical gatherings.

However, I maintain a relatively high probability because:
- The Waqf Amendment Act protests show growing momentum and coordination
- Multiple protest locations increase the chance of at least one reaching 10,000+
- The issue has demographic significance affecting 210 million Muslims
- Institutional backing from AIMPLB provides organizational support
- The 60-day window provides sufficient time for mobilization
- Historical precedent shows India's capacity for very large protests

# Checklist:
1. Will the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants between question launch and July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 71% chance given historical patterns and current factors
3. Consistency: 65 out of 100 times, a protest of this scale would occur and be recorded in this timeframe
4. Key evidence: Active Waqf Act protests with growing momentum; multiple protest hubs increase chances; AIMPLB providing institutional support; no recent reports of 10,000+ protests
5. Blind spot: Waqf Act protests failing to mobilize sufficient numbers despite strong indicators
6. Status quo: Active nationwide protest movement showing growth; slight adjustment from 71% to 65% maintains alignment with this status quo

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Thane school parents protest (April 26, 2025)**
   - Small, localized protest over a Rs 10,000 fee hike
   - Recent and reliable source (Times of India)
   - Limited relevance: Clearly below 10,000 participants

2. **Al Jazeera mapping major protests (March 2021)**
   - Historical context: 900+ global protests with >10,000 participants (2010-2020)
   - India-specific data: 2,800 farmer protests since 2020, claimed 250 million general strike
   - High reliability for factual reporting; union participation claims may be inflated
   - Highly relevant baseline: Shows India routinely has protests exceeding 10,000 participants

3. **TMC protest teachers' job loss (April 7, 2025)**
   - Planned April 9 protest in Kolkata over Supreme Court terminating 25,000 teachers
   - Recent, reliable source (India Today)
   - Moderate relevance: Major political issue that could mobilize large numbers

4. **Farmers' march against highway project (March 2025)**
   - Explicitly states "10,000 farmers to march" on March 12, 2025
   - Reliable regional source (Free Press Journal)
   - High relevance: Directly mentions threshold-meeting protest size

5. **AP News and Britannica sources**
   - Limited relevance to current protest activity in India

6. **Asknews query results**
   - Mostly focused on protests outside India (France, Germany, Serbia)
   - One planned caste-based protest in Agra (Hindustan, March 28, 2025)
   - One diaspora protest in US by Indian Hindu groups (May 1, 2025)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Historical pattern established by Al Jazeera data showing India routinely experiences multiple protests >10,000 yearly
- Between 2019-2021, India saw at least three major protest waves (CAA, farmers' protests), each with multiple events exceeding 10,000 participants
- Structural factors remain consistent: large population, active civil society, contentious political issues

**Moderate evidence:**
- Free Press Journal explicitly mentioned "10,000 farmers to march" for March 12, 2025 event
- TMC organizing major protests across West Bengal in April 2025 over teacher terminations
- Multiple active issues currently mobilizing different constituencies (farmers, teachers, religious groups)

**Weak evidence:**
- Small, localized protests (Thane parents) indicate continued protest activity but below threshold
- Diaspora protests suggest issues resonating with Indian communities but not counted for this question

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question covers a 60-day window from today (May 2, 2025) until July 1, 2025.

If the timeframe were halved (30 days):
- Probability would decrease moderately (~10-15%)
- Less time for new issues to emerge or escalate
- Still reasonable chance given active mobilizations already underway

If the timeframe were doubled (120 days):
- Probability would increase significantly (~5-10%)
- Additional time would almost certainly capture at least one major protest wave
- Would include monsoon season aftermath when agricultural policy protests often intensify

## (d) Justification

The historical baseline indicates India typically experiences:
- 1-2 major protest waves annually
- Each wave containing multiple events exceeding 10,000 participants
- Monthly probability of ~10-15% for at least one >10,000 protest
- For a 2-month period: ~20-25% baseline probability

Current factors significantly increase this probability:

1. **Active mobilization on multiple fronts:**
   - Farmers opposing the Shaktipeeth Highway project (explicitly planning 10,000-person march)
   - Teachers and TMC supporters protesting termination of 25,000 teachers
   - Religious groups mobilizing against Waqf Amendment Bill
   - Caste organizations planning demonstrations

2. **Seasonal and political timing:**
   - Pre-monsoon period (May-June) historically favorable for outdoor gatherings
   - State elections likely to generate large political rallies
   - Anniversary of previous protests may trigger commemorative events

3. **Recent precedent:**
   - Planned farmer protest in March 2025 explicitly expected 10,000+ participants
   - Multiple concurrent issues increase chances of at least one crossing threshold

Given India's size, political diversity, and active civil society, the convergence of multiple mobilization efforts during this 60-day window makes at least one 10,000+ participant protest highly likely.

## Probability calibration

Starting with the historical baseline of ~25% for a random 2-month period, I adjust significantly upward based on:

1. Current activism level showing multiple constituencies actively mobilizing
2. Explicit planning for protests with 10,000+ participants in recent months
3. Pre-monsoon season timing favorable for large outdoor gatherings
4. Multiple distinct issues (agricultural, educational, religious, caste) each with separate mobilization potential
5. India's consistent pattern of large protests even during periods of government restriction

However, I must acknowledge uncertainties:
- Potential government crackdowns or restrictions on assembly
- Protest fatigue on long-running issues
- Possibility that protests remain fragmented across multiple smaller events
- Global Protest Tracker's coverage may miss some events

Balancing these factors, I believe an 85% probability is well-calibrated.

## Checklist:
1. Will the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants by June 30, 2025?
2. Base rate: ~25% for random 2-month period, adjusted for current factors
3. Consistency: "In 85 of 100 similar 60-day periods with this level of activism, India would experience at least one protest exceeding 10,000 participants."
4. Key evidence: Multiple active issues mobilizing different constituencies; explicit planning for 10,000+ participant events; favorable seasonal timing; India's consistent protest history
5. Blind spot: Government implementing severe restrictions or protests fragmenting across locations
6. Status quo: Regular large-scale protests continue to be a feature of Indian civil society

Probability: 85%
Predicted Probability: 85.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will the Carnegie Endowment’s Global Protest Tracker record a single protest in India with at least 10,000 participants, whose start date falls between the question’s launch and July 1, 2025?

2. Source analysis  
 • Al Jazeera “Mapping major protests around the world” (Mar 2021): Reliable, documents 900+ global protests of 10,000+ from 2010–2020 and multiple large Indian movements (e.g., 2020 farmers’ blockade). Strong historical baseline for India’s capacity to mobilize large crowds.  
 • Perplexity India protest survey (Apr 2025): Aggregates credible counts for CAA protests (Shaheen Bagh: 10,000+; Kochi: 500,000; Hyderabad: 100,000) and 2020–21 farmers’ protests (300,000 at Delhi). Confirms multiple 10,000+ mobilizations in recent years. Strong reference class data.  
 • Scroll.in “Legal notices over silent Waqf protests” (Apr 6 2025): Government served 300+ residents for a silent opposition to the Waqf Amendment Act. Indicates state sensitivity but no large gathering yet. Moderate relevance.  
 • Siasat Daily “‘Lights-out’ protest” (Apr 30 2025): Symbolic nation-wide action against Waqf bill by Muslim groups. No participant counts but demonstrates organized momentum. Moderate relevance.  
 • Times of India “Thane school parents protest” (Apr 26 2025): ~100 parents, far below threshold. Illustrative of protest culture but irrelevant for 10,000+ criterion. Weak relevance.

3. Reference-class (outside-view) estimate  
From 2019–2024 India saw roughly 3–4 protests exceeding 10,000 participants over ~5 years ⇒ annual probability ~ 70%.  

4. Timeframe adjustment  
Window is ~60 days (May 2–June 30). 60/365 ≈ 0.16 of a year ⇒ naïve outside-view probability ≈ 0.70×0.16 ≈ 11%.  

5. Evidence analysis & weighing  
 • Historical pattern of large Indian movements since 2019 (CAA, farmers): Strong evidence that India can muster 10,000+ on salient issues.  
 • Ongoing Waqf Amendment Act protests: Moderate evidence of growing mobilization, but so far only symbolic/no 10,000+ gathering reported.  
 • Government crackdown (legal notices, paramilitary deployment): Moderate evidence it could either suppress or inflame protests.  
 • No other major flashpoint (e.g., nationwide strike call, mass economic shock) currently scheduled: Weak evidence of additional catalysts.  

6. Justification (inside view)  
 • Base‐rate for large protests in India: ~0.7/year ⇒ ~11% for 60-day span.  
 • Waqf Act protests are active but dispersed and largely symbolic thus far—unlikely to surge suddenly from a few hundred to 10,000+ in next 2 months.  
 • No imminent election, nationwide strike, or comparable catalyst announced that routinely draws >10,000.  
 • Government actions may provoke larger turnout, but the short window and heat season in India reduce odds.

Hence, I modestly up‐adjust the naïve 11% (outside view) to 25% to reflect moderate momentum around the Waqf issue and India’s proven mobilization capacity, while recognizing the limited timeframe and lack of a galvanizing national call.

Probability calibration  
I aim to predict true odds. A 25% chance means that in four analogous 60-day windows I’d expect one recorded 10,000+ protest.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase correct: Yes.  
2. Base rate: ~11% for 60 days; inside view ~25%.  
3. Consistency: “25 out of 100 times, we see a 10,000+ protest recorded.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Past India large protests since 2019 (Strong).  
   • Active Waqf protests (Moderate).  
   • Government crackdown (Moderate).  
   • No major new catalyst (Weak).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden, unexpected national leadership call (e.g., a mass farmers’ strike) could trigger a large protest and push probability higher.  
6. Status quo: India’s protest climate is steady; violent economic shocks or major legislation usually drive big crowds.

Probability: 25%
Predicted Probability: 25.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question  
   We’re forecasting the probability that, between now (May 2, 2025) and July 1, 2025, the Global Protest Tracker will report at least one new protest in India with 10,000 or more participants.

2. Source analysis  
   • Times of India (Apr 26): Parents in Thane protested a ₹10,000 school “facility fee.” No reliable headcount; likely hundreds or low thousands. (Local press; factual on grievances; low relevance for ≥10k.)  
   • India Today (Apr 7): West Bengal teachers’ rallies on April 9 & 11 after mass terminations. Organizers claim “massive” turnout but no independent count; probably under 10k in any single location. (Reputable; no clear ≥10k evidence.)  
   • Free Press Journal (Mar 12): Farmers from 12 districts “expected” >10,000 to march against a highway project. This was a planned mobilization, but we have no post-event verification on actual turnout. (Local aggregator; projection not confirmed; moderate relevance.)  
   • Al Jazeera (Mar 2021): Historical mapping showing India sees 1–2 protests ≥10k per year (e.g., 2020 farmers, general strike). (High-quality, systematic inventory; strong for reference class.)  
   • AskNews global articles (May 1): Detailed coverage of large protests in France, Germany and the US; none on India. (Reliable but no India events; confirms no major India protests in late April/early May.)  

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence:  
    – Historical rate of India protests ≥10k ~2 per year (Al Jazeera/ACLED/Global Protest Tracker).  
   Moderate evidence:  
    – Free Press Journal farmers’ march planning >10k (but unconfirmed).  
    – No major national elections or universal strikes scheduled before July.  
    – Government’s readiness to impose bonds/shutdowns deters large gatherings.  
   Weak evidence:  
    – Local fee-hike and teacher protests (claims of “massive” support but no counts).  
    – No emerging pan-India coordinating body for large demo.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – Window: 60 days until July 1.  
   – Annual hazard from reference class: 2 events/365 days ≈0.55% per day.  
   – Cumulative 60-day probability ≈1–exp(–0.0055×60) ≈29%.  
   – If window halved (30 days): ≈1–exp(–0.0055×30) ≈15%.  
   – If doubled (120 days): ≈1–exp(–0.0055×120) ≈46%.  

5. Justification and adjustment  
   Outside view yields ~29%.  
   We adjust downward to ≈15% (“inside view”) because:  
    – No confirmed India protests ≥10k have materialized since April despite multiple flashpoints.  
    – Planned large farmers’ march remains unverified.  
    – Absence of a clear nationwide catalyst (e.g., major labor strike, new controversial legislation).  
    – Government’s preventive measures (bond notices, rapid deployment) raise the bar.  
   This 15% captures moderate but not negligible chance of a spontaneous or organized mass protest emerging in the next two months.

Probability calibration  
We predict a 15% chance that the Global Protest Tracker will add an India protest ≥10,000 participants before July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast whether India will see a new ≥10k protest reported by GPT between May 2 and July 1, 2025.  
2. Outside view base rate: ≈2 India protests ≥10k per year → ~29% over 60 days.  
3. Consistency: “15 out of 100 times, India sees a new ≥10k protest in this window.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   a. Historical ~2/year (strong).  
   b. No large new trigger identified (moderate).  
   c. Govt deterrence (moderate).  
   d. Unverified farmer march (weak).  
5. Blind spot: A sudden nationwide strike or viral social-media mobilization could push turnout past 10k.  
6. Status quo: India’s protest rate is steady; no strong trend upwards in this period.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Free Press Journal, 10 Feb 2025, “Shaktipeeth Highway: 10 000 Farmers To March …” – local Indian daily, factual details on planned 12 Mar march, quotes organiser & politician; crowd figure (“over 10 000 farmers”) is an organiser estimate (possible inflation).  
2. India Today, 7 Apr 2025, “TMC protest after teacher sackings” – national mainstream outlet, factual on Supreme-Court order; TMC promises “massive rally” 9 Apr. Size claims come from party spokespeople (self-interested).  
3. Times of India, 26 Apr 2025, “Thane school parents protest” – India’s largest newspaper; describes hundreds of parents, certainly <10 k.  
4. Global Protest Tracker (GPT) website – adjudicating database; high reliability; updated roughly monthly; includes only protests it codes as ≥10 000 participants.  
5. Other articles in the news bundle (France, Germany, Serbia, USA, Bangladesh, Britannica) are unrelated to Indian protests and supply no evidence for or against resolution.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)  
Strong  
• Historical GPT record: 7 new India entries 2017-2024 ⇒ ≈1.0 entry / yr. (structural, well-coded).  

Moderate  
• Two announced 2025 Indian actions (12 Mar farmers, 9 Apr teachers) plausibly ≥10 k and meet “start-after-launch” criterion; uncertain if GPT will code them (single identifiable sources, organiser estimates).  
• Farmers unions (SKM) periodically call nationwide marches; risk of another mobilisation before monsoon session (indirect but logical).

Weak  
• Thane parents protest (<10 k) – shows general protest climate but irrelevant to threshold.  
• Generic political/heat-wave discontent – speculative.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today → 1 Jul 2025 = 60 days (0.166 yr).  
If arrival of GPT-qualifying Indian protests ≈Poisson(λ=1 / yr):  
 P(new event in window) ≈ 1-e^(-0.166) = 15 %.  
Halving the window (30 days) → ~8 %.  
Doubling (120 days) → ~28 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
+3 ppt: A farmers march (12 Mar) and TMC-led teachers rallies (9 Apr) may already satisfy criteria; GPT often posts with 1-3 month lag.  
+2 ppt: Possibility of renewed large-scale farm or unemployment protests in May/June (Parliament budget, heat-wave power-cuts) – moderate evidence.  
-1 ppt: Both candidate protests rely on organiser estimates; GPT may judge turnout <10 k or merge with earlier movements and reject as “continuation”.  

Net adjustment from 15 % → 19 % (rounded to 20 % for clarity).

Probability calibration
My best estimate is that in 20 of 100 similar years the Global Protest Tracker would list at least one qualifying Indian protest that began between the question launch and 30 Jun 2025.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will GPT add any Indian protest of ≥10 k that starts after question launch and before 1 Jul 2025?”  
2. Base rate – 1 entry / yr ⇒ 15 % in 60 days slice.  
3. Consistency – “20 out of 100 times, GPT registers such a protest.”  
4. Key evidence – a) Historical 1/yr rate; b) 12 Mar farmers march; c) 9 Apr teachers statewide rallies; d) GPT lag 1-3 mo; e) Threshold/continuation filter.  
5. Blind-spot – Sudden nationwide flash-protest (e.g., exam leak) drawing >100 k in late June, quickly coded by GPT. Would raise odds.  
6. Status-quo – No 2025 GPT Indian entry yet; continuation of typical yearly frequency favours “No”.

Probability: 20%
Predicted Probability: 20.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Times of India (April 26, 2025)**: Recent article about a localized parents' protest at a Thane school over fee hikes. Reliable news source but describes a small-scale protest unlikely to reach 10,000 participants. Limited relevance to our question.

**Al Jazeera "Mapping major protests" article**: Provides valuable historical context, noting 900 global protests with 10,000+ participants between 2010-2020, including significant protests in India (particularly the 2020 farmers' protests with claimed participation of 250 million). High-quality international news source with factual reporting on protest trends.

**India Today (April 7, 2025)**: Recent article from major Indian news outlet about planned TMC protests against teacher job terminations. While participant numbers aren't specified, the scale of the issue (25,000 terminated teachers) suggests potential for large mobilization. High relevance as it reflects current political mobilization capacity.

**Free Press Journal (March 2025)**: Reports on planned 10,000-farmer march against highway project for March 12, starting from Azad Maidan, Mumbai. Explicit mention of expected 10,000 participants shows recent precedent for protests of this scale. Moderate relevance as it predates our current date but shows mobilization capacity.

**AP News (April 1, 2025)**: Primarily covers US political developments with minimal relevance to Indian protests. High credibility source but low relevance to our question.

**Britannica article on Jallianwala Bagh Massacre**: Historical context only, providing background on India's protest history but not current conditions. High credibility but low direct relevance.

**Asknews query results**: Despite specifically requesting articles about "India's recent mass protests since April 2025 with estimated 10,000 or more participants," results primarily focused on protests in France, Germany, and other countries. Some articles mention:
- Hindu groups protesting in US over Pahalgam attack (April 2025) that killed 26 people in India
- Bangladesh protests against Israeli actions in Gaza
- No clear evidence of recent Indian protests exceeding 10,000 participants

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence**:
- Historical precedent: Al Jazeera documents substantial history of large-scale protests in India, including farmer protests in 2020-2021 with extraordinary participation numbers
- Concrete planning: Free Press Journal reported planned 10,000-person farmer march in March 2025, showing organizational capacity for protests of this scale
- Active religious/identity issue: The Waqf Amendment Act passed in April 2025 has already generated nationwide protests according to current information, with the issue directly affecting India's Muslim population (210 million citizens)
- Institutional support: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) is actively coordinating protest efforts

**Moderate evidence**:
- Multiple protest hubs: Sources mention Waqf Act protest activity across several states (West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad, Delhi)
- Growing momentum: Progression from localized protests to nationwide "lights out" symbolic action by April 30 shows coordination capacity
- Teachers' protest: TMC planning coordinated protests across West Bengal in April 2025 over 25,000 terminated positions

**Weak evidence**:
- Pahalgam attack: 26 people killed in April 2025, potentially triggering protests, but no evidence yet of large-scale mobilization within India
- Absence of recent reporting: Specific search for Indian protests with 10,000+ participants since April 2025 didn't return direct results

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

We have a 60-day window from today (May 2, 2025) to the resolution date (July 1, 2025).

This timeframe is:
- Long enough for protest movements to organize large gatherings, especially those already active
- Spans pre-monsoon season, when weather is hot but generally dry enough for outdoor gatherings
- Sufficient for the already-mobilizing Waqf Act protests to potentially reach critical mass

If the timeframe were halved (30 days), I would reduce my confidence significantly, as there would be less time for momentum to build to the 10,000+ threshold.

If doubled (120 days), I would increase confidence substantially, as it would span multiple potential trigger events and allow more time for organizing large-scale gatherings.

## (d) Justification

Starting with the outside view base rate of 71%, I need to consider whether current evidence warrants adjustment:

**Factors supporting high probability**:
1. Active nationwide protest movement against the Waqf Amendment Act with institutional backing
2. Issue directly affects 210 million Muslims, providing large potential participant base
3. Multiple protest hubs across several states increase chances of at least one location reaching 10,000+
4. Recent precedent (March 2025 planned 10,000-person farmer protest) demonstrates capacity
5. Additional issues (teacher terminations, Pahalgam attack) provide multiple potential triggers

**Factors suggesting moderation**:
1. Specific search for Indian protests with 10,000+ participants since April 2025 returned no clear results
2. Pre-monsoon heat (May-June) might slightly dampen outdoor participation
3. Current Waqf protests appear to have focused on symbolic actions rather than mass gatherings

While the active nationwide movement and multiple protest hubs support the high outside view probability, the lack of recent examples of protests reaching 10,000+ participants suggests a slightly more conservative adjustment is warranted.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view of 71%, I believe a modest downward adjustment to 65% is appropriate. This adjustment accounts for:

1. The absence of clear evidence of protests reaching 10,000+ participants in April/early May 2025, despite a specific search for such information.

2. The symbolic nature of the most recent Waqf Act protest (nationwide "lights out" on April 30) rather than large physical gatherings.

However, I maintain a relatively high probability because:
- The Waqf Amendment Act protests show growing momentum and coordination
- Multiple protest locations increase the chance of at least one reaching 10,000+
- The issue has demographic significance affecting 210 million Muslims
- Institutional backing from AIMPLB provides organizational support
- The 60-day window provides sufficient time for mobilization
- Historical precedent shows India's capacity for very large protests

# Checklist:
1. Will the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants between question launch and July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 71% chance given historical patterns and current factors
3. Consistency: 65 out of 100 times, a protest of this scale would occur and be recorded in this timeframe
4. Key evidence: Active Waqf Act protests with growing momentum; multiple protest hubs increase chances; AIMPLB providing institutional support; no recent reports of 10,000+ protests
5. Blind spot: Waqf Act protests failing to mobilize sufficient numbers despite strong indicators
6. Status quo: Active nationwide protest movement showing growth; slight adjustment from 71% to 65% maintains alignment with this status quo

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Thane school parents protest (April 26, 2025)**
   - Small, localized protest over a Rs 10,000 fee hike
   - Recent and reliable source (Times of India)
   - Limited relevance: Clearly below 10,000 participants

2. **Al Jazeera mapping major protests (March 2021)**
   - Historical context: 900+ global protests with >10,000 participants (2010-2020)
   - India-specific data: 2,800 farmer protests since 2020, claimed 250 million general strike
   - High reliability for factual reporting; union participation claims may be inflated
   - Highly relevant baseline: Shows India routinely has protests exceeding 10,000 participants

3. **TMC protest teachers' job loss (April 7, 2025)**
   - Planned April 9 protest in Kolkata over Supreme Court terminating 25,000 teachers
   - Recent, reliable source (India Today)
   - Moderate relevance: Major political issue that could mobilize large numbers

4. **Farmers' march against highway project (March 2025)**
   - Explicitly states "10,000 farmers to march" on March 12, 2025
   - Reliable regional source (Free Press Journal)
   - High relevance: Directly mentions threshold-meeting protest size

5. **AP News and Britannica sources**
   - Limited relevance to current protest activity in India

6. **Asknews query results**
   - Mostly focused on protests outside India (France, Germany, Serbia)
   - One planned caste-based protest in Agra (Hindustan, March 28, 2025)
   - One diaspora protest in US by Indian Hindu groups (May 1, 2025)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Historical pattern established by Al Jazeera data showing India routinely experiences multiple protests >10,000 yearly
- Between 2019-2021, India saw at least three major protest waves (CAA, farmers' protests), each with multiple events exceeding 10,000 participants
- Structural factors remain consistent: large population, active civil society, contentious political issues

**Moderate evidence:**
- Free Press Journal explicitly mentioned "10,000 farmers to march" for March 12, 2025 event
- TMC organizing major protests across West Bengal in April 2025 over teacher terminations
- Multiple active issues currently mobilizing different constituencies (farmers, teachers, religious groups)

**Weak evidence:**
- Small, localized protests (Thane parents) indicate continued protest activity but below threshold
- Diaspora protests suggest issues resonating with Indian communities but not counted for this question

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question covers a 60-day window from today (May 2, 2025) until July 1, 2025.

If the timeframe were halved (30 days):
- Probability would decrease moderately (~10-15%)
- Less time for new issues to emerge or escalate
- Still reasonable chance given active mobilizations already underway

If the timeframe were doubled (120 days):
- Probability would increase significantly (~5-10%)
- Additional time would almost certainly capture at least one major protest wave
- Would include monsoon season aftermath when agricultural policy protests often intensify

## (d) Justification

The historical baseline indicates India typically experiences:
- 1-2 major protest waves annually
- Each wave containing multiple events exceeding 10,000 participants
- Monthly probability of ~10-15% for at least one >10,000 protest
- For a 2-month period: ~20-25% baseline probability

Current factors significantly increase this probability:

1. **Active mobilization on multiple fronts:**
   - Farmers opposing the Shaktipeeth Highway project (explicitly planning 10,000-person march)
   - Teachers and TMC supporters protesting termination of 25,000 teachers
   - Religious groups mobilizing against Waqf Amendment Bill
   - Caste organizations planning demonstrations

2. **Seasonal and political timing:**
   - Pre-monsoon period (May-June) historically favorable for outdoor gatherings
   - State elections likely to generate large political rallies
   - Anniversary of previous protests may trigger commemorative events

3. **Recent precedent:**
   - Planned farmer protest in March 2025 explicitly expected 10,000+ participants
   - Multiple concurrent issues increase chances of at least one crossing threshold

Given India's size, political diversity, and active civil society, the convergence of multiple mobilization efforts during this 60-day window makes at least one 10,000+ participant protest highly likely.

## Probability calibration

Starting with the historical baseline of ~25% for a random 2-month period, I adjust significantly upward based on:

1. Current activism level showing multiple constituencies actively mobilizing
2. Explicit planning for protests with 10,000+ participants in recent months
3. Pre-monsoon season timing favorable for large outdoor gatherings
4. Multiple distinct issues (agricultural, educational, religious, caste) each with separate mobilization potential
5. India's consistent pattern of large protests even during periods of government restriction

However, I must acknowledge uncertainties:
- Potential government crackdowns or restrictions on assembly
- Protest fatigue on long-running issues
- Possibility that protests remain fragmented across multiple smaller events
- Global Protest Tracker's coverage may miss some events

Balancing these factors, I believe an 85% probability is well-calibrated.

## Checklist:
1. Will the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants by June 30, 2025?
2. Base rate: ~25% for random 2-month period, adjusted for current factors
3. Consistency: "In 85 of 100 similar 60-day periods with this level of activism, India would experience at least one protest exceeding 10,000 participants."
4. Key evidence: Multiple active issues mobilizing different constituencies; explicit planning for 10,000+ participant events; favorable seasonal timing; India's consistent protest history
5. Blind spot: Government implementing severe restrictions or protests fragmenting across locations
6. Status quo: Regular large-scale protests continue to be a feature of Indian civil society

Probability: 85%
Predicted Probability: 85.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase  
Will the Carnegie Endowment’s Global Protest Tracker record a single protest in India with at least 10,000 participants, whose start date falls between the question’s launch and July 1, 2025?

2. Source analysis  
 • Al Jazeera “Mapping major protests around the world” (Mar 2021): Reliable, documents 900+ global protests of 10,000+ from 2010–2020 and multiple large Indian movements (e.g., 2020 farmers’ blockade). Strong historical baseline for India’s capacity to mobilize large crowds.  
 • Perplexity India protest survey (Apr 2025): Aggregates credible counts for CAA protests (Shaheen Bagh: 10,000+; Kochi: 500,000; Hyderabad: 100,000) and 2020–21 farmers’ protests (300,000 at Delhi). Confirms multiple 10,000+ mobilizations in recent years. Strong reference class data.  
 • Scroll.in “Legal notices over silent Waqf protests” (Apr 6 2025): Government served 300+ residents for a silent opposition to the Waqf Amendment Act. Indicates state sensitivity but no large gathering yet. Moderate relevance.  
 • Siasat Daily “‘Lights-out’ protest” (Apr 30 2025): Symbolic nation-wide action against Waqf bill by Muslim groups. No participant counts but demonstrates organized momentum. Moderate relevance.  
 • Times of India “Thane school parents protest” (Apr 26 2025): ~100 parents, far below threshold. Illustrative of protest culture but irrelevant for 10,000+ criterion. Weak relevance.

3. Reference-class (outside-view) estimate  
From 2019–2024 India saw roughly 3–4 protests exceeding 10,000 participants over ~5 years ⇒ annual probability ~ 70%.  

4. Timeframe adjustment  
Window is ~60 days (May 2–June 30). 60/365 ≈ 0.16 of a year ⇒ naïve outside-view probability ≈ 0.70×0.16 ≈ 11%.  

5. Evidence analysis & weighing  
 • Historical pattern of large Indian movements since 2019 (CAA, farmers): Strong evidence that India can muster 10,000+ on salient issues.  
 • Ongoing Waqf Amendment Act protests: Moderate evidence of growing mobilization, but so far only symbolic/no 10,000+ gathering reported.  
 • Government crackdown (legal notices, paramilitary deployment): Moderate evidence it could either suppress or inflame protests.  
 • No other major flashpoint (e.g., nationwide strike call, mass economic shock) currently scheduled: Weak evidence of additional catalysts.  

6. Justification (inside view)  
 • Base‐rate for large protests in India: ~0.7/year ⇒ ~11% for 60-day span.  
 • Waqf Act protests are active but dispersed and largely symbolic thus far—unlikely to surge suddenly from a few hundred to 10,000+ in next 2 months.  
 • No imminent election, nationwide strike, or comparable catalyst announced that routinely draws >10,000.  
 • Government actions may provoke larger turnout, but the short window and heat season in India reduce odds.

Hence, I modestly up‐adjust the naïve 11% (outside view) to 25% to reflect moderate momentum around the Waqf issue and India’s proven mobilization capacity, while recognizing the limited timeframe and lack of a galvanizing national call.

Probability calibration  
I aim to predict true odds. A 25% chance means that in four analogous 60-day windows I’d expect one recorded 10,000+ protest.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase correct: Yes.  
2. Base rate: ~11% for 60 days; inside view ~25%.  
3. Consistency: “25 out of 100 times, we see a 10,000+ protest recorded.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Past India large protests since 2019 (Strong).  
   • Active Waqf protests (Moderate).  
   • Government crackdown (Moderate).  
   • No major new catalyst (Weak).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden, unexpected national leadership call (e.g., a mass farmers’ strike) could trigger a large protest and push probability higher.  
6. Status quo: India’s protest climate is steady; violent economic shocks or major legislation usually drive big crowds.

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question  
   We’re forecasting the probability that, between now (May 2, 2025) and July 1, 2025, the Global Protest Tracker will report at least one new protest in India with 10,000 or more participants.

2. Source analysis  
   • Times of India (Apr 26): Parents in Thane protested a ₹10,000 school “facility fee.” No reliable headcount; likely hundreds or low thousands. (Local press; factual on grievances; low relevance for ≥10k.)  
   • India Today (Apr 7): West Bengal teachers’ rallies on April 9 & 11 after mass terminations. Organizers claim “massive” turnout but no independent count; probably under 10k in any single location. (Reputable; no clear ≥10k evidence.)  
   • Free Press Journal (Mar 12): Farmers from 12 districts “expected” >10,000 to march against a highway project. This was a planned mobilization, but we have no post-event verification on actual turnout. (Local aggregator; projection not confirmed; moderate relevance.)  
   • Al Jazeera (Mar 2021): Historical mapping showing India sees 1–2 protests ≥10k per year (e.g., 2020 farmers, general strike). (High-quality, systematic inventory; strong for reference class.)  
   • AskNews global articles (May 1): Detailed coverage of large protests in France, Germany and the US; none on India. (Reliable but no India events; confirms no major India protests in late April/early May.)  

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence:  
    – Historical rate of India protests ≥10k ~2 per year (Al Jazeera/ACLED/Global Protest Tracker).  
   Moderate evidence:  
    – Free Press Journal farmers’ march planning >10k (but unconfirmed).  
    – No major national elections or universal strikes scheduled before July.  
    – Government’s readiness to impose bonds/shutdowns deters large gatherings.  
   Weak evidence:  
    – Local fee-hike and teacher protests (claims of “massive” support but no counts).  
    – No emerging pan-India coordinating body for large demo.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
   – Window: 60 days until July 1.  
   – Annual hazard from reference class: 2 events/365 days ≈0.55% per day.  
   – Cumulative 60-day probability ≈1–exp(–0.0055×60) ≈29%.  
   – If window halved (30 days): ≈1–exp(–0.0055×30) ≈15%.  
   – If doubled (120 days): ≈1–exp(–0.0055×120) ≈46%.  

5. Justification and adjustment  
   Outside view yields ~29%.  
   We adjust downward to ≈15% (“inside view”) because:  
    – No confirmed India protests ≥10k have materialized since April despite multiple flashpoints.  
    – Planned large farmers’ march remains unverified.  
    – Absence of a clear nationwide catalyst (e.g., major labor strike, new controversial legislation).  
    – Government’s preventive measures (bond notices, rapid deployment) raise the bar.  
   This 15% captures moderate but not negligible chance of a spontaneous or organized mass protest emerging in the next two months.

Probability calibration  
We predict a 15% chance that the Global Protest Tracker will add an India protest ≥10,000 participants before July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast whether India will see a new ≥10k protest reported by GPT between May 2 and July 1, 2025.  
2. Outside view base rate: ≈2 India protests ≥10k per year → ~29% over 60 days.  
3. Consistency: “15 out of 100 times, India sees a new ≥10k protest in this window.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   a. Historical ~2/year (strong).  
   b. No large new trigger identified (moderate).  
   c. Govt deterrence (moderate).  
   d. Unverified farmer march (weak).  
5. Blind spot: A sudden nationwide strike or viral social-media mobilization could push turnout past 10k.  
6. Status quo: India’s protest rate is steady; no strong trend upwards in this period.

Probability: 15%
Predicted Probability: 15.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Free Press Journal, 10 Feb 2025, “Shaktipeeth Highway: 10 000 Farmers To March …” – local Indian daily, factual details on planned 12 Mar march, quotes organiser & politician; crowd figure (“over 10 000 farmers”) is an organiser estimate (possible inflation).  
2. India Today, 7 Apr 2025, “TMC protest after teacher sackings” – national mainstream outlet, factual on Supreme-Court order; TMC promises “massive rally” 9 Apr. Size claims come from party spokespeople (self-interested).  
3. Times of India, 26 Apr 2025, “Thane school parents protest” – India’s largest newspaper; describes hundreds of parents, certainly <10 k.  
4. Global Protest Tracker (GPT) website – adjudicating database; high reliability; updated roughly monthly; includes only protests it codes as ≥10 000 participants.  
5. Other articles in the news bundle (France, Germany, Serbia, USA, Bangladesh, Britannica) are unrelated to Indian protests and supply no evidence for or against resolution.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)  
Strong  
• Historical GPT record: 7 new India entries 2017-2024 ⇒ ≈1.0 entry / yr. (structural, well-coded).  

Moderate  
• Two announced 2025 Indian actions (12 Mar farmers, 9 Apr teachers) plausibly ≥10 k and meet “start-after-launch” criterion; uncertain if GPT will code them (single identifiable sources, organiser estimates).  
• Farmers unions (SKM) periodically call nationwide marches; risk of another mobilisation before monsoon session (indirect but logical).

Weak  
• Thane parents protest (<10 k) – shows general protest climate but irrelevant to threshold.  
• Generic political/heat-wave discontent – speculative.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today → 1 Jul 2025 = 60 days (0.166 yr).  
If arrival of GPT-qualifying Indian protests ≈Poisson(λ=1 / yr):  
 P(new event in window) ≈ 1-e^(-0.166) = 15 %.  
Halving the window (30 days) → ~8 %.  
Doubling (120 days) → ~28 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
+3 ppt: A farmers march (12 Mar) and TMC-led teachers rallies (9 Apr) may already satisfy criteria; GPT often posts with 1-3 month lag.  
+2 ppt: Possibility of renewed large-scale farm or unemployment protests in May/June (Parliament budget, heat-wave power-cuts) – moderate evidence.  
-1 ppt: Both candidate protests rely on organiser estimates; GPT may judge turnout <10 k or merge with earlier movements and reject as “continuation”.  

Net adjustment from 15 % → 19 % (rounded to 20 % for clarity).

Probability calibration
My best estimate is that in 20 of 100 similar years the Global Protest Tracker would list at least one qualifying Indian protest that began between the question launch and 30 Jun 2025.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will GPT add any Indian protest of ≥10 k that starts after question launch and before 1 Jul 2025?”  
2. Base rate – 1 entry / yr ⇒ 15 % in 60 days slice.  
3. Consistency – “20 out of 100 times, GPT registers such a protest.”  
4. Key evidence – a) Historical 1/yr rate; b) 12 Mar farmers march; c) 9 Apr teachers statewide rallies; d) GPT lag 1-3 mo; e) Threshold/continuation filter.  
5. Blind-spot – Sudden nationwide flash-protest (e.g., exam leak) drawing >100 k in late June, quickly coded by GPT. Would raise odds.  
6. Status-quo – No 2025 GPT Indian entry yet; continuation of typical yearly frequency favours “No”.
