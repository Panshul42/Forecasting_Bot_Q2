Analysis:
The key to forming an outside‐view baseline is understanding the Project 2025 Tracker’s track record of moving objectives from “in progress” to “complete,” as well as the broader political history of proposals to break up NOAA. I need to know when the Keep_Track subreddit launched the Tracker, how frequently objectives get updated or finalized, and whether any similar organizational breakup goals have succeeded or stalled. Additionally, I want context on legislative or administrative attempts to dismantle or restructure NOAA to gauge feasibility and typical timelines.

Analysis:
The key to resolving whether the “break up NOAA” objective will be marked complete by July 1, 2025 is to track any updates to the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet. Since it’s currently listed as “in progress,” I need to find recent changes or announcements—especially on the Keep_Track subreddit or related platforms—that indicate it’s been flipped to “complete.” Relevant factors include: Has the spreadsheet owner or a contributor posted an update? Are there news articles, press releases, or social‐media posts from organizations backing Project 2025 (e.g., Heritage Foundation) confirming that the NOAA breakup objective is done? Subreddit discussions often note when cells change. With under two months left, any sign of completion would be critical. I will search for direct references to the Tracker’s NOAA goal status, including updates or commentary, to form an inside view adjustment to our base‐rate projection.

Here’s a concise summary of Democracy Forward’s “The People’s Guide to Project 2025”:

• Source and Purpose  
  – Prepared by Democracy Forward as a public guide to Project 2025’s “Mandate for Leadership,” a 900+-page policy playbook authored by former Trump officials and allied extremists.  
  – Aims to expose how Heritage Foundation–led Project 2025 (backed by an eight-figure budget and 100+ right-wing organizations) intends to empower a future far-right administration to enact sweeping changes via executive action alone—bypassing Congress and relying on a sympathetic federal judiciary.

• Key Project 2025 Proposals and Impacts (claimed doable without new legislation)  
  1. Labor and Workplace  
     – Eliminate or rollback overtime protections (up to 4.3 million workers affected).  
     – Relax worker‐safety rules and permit broader workplace discrimination.  
  2. Social Safety Net  
     – Cut food assistance for some 40 million people.  
     – Slash early-education funding, veterans’ disability support, and farm assistance.  
  3. Healthcare and Reproductive Rights  
     – Undermine Medicare and keep prescription drug prices high.  
     – Restrict or roll back reproductive‐health protections.  
  4. Civil Rights and Discrimination  
     – Weaken federal civil-rights enforcement in schools, workplaces, housing, and public spaces.  
  5. Environment and Climate  
     – Reverse decades of pollution controls and climate-protection measures.  
  6. Education  
     – Defund public schools, remove curricula standards, and weaken student‐protection policies.  
  7. Federal Workforce and Administration  
     – Politicize or dismantle the professional civil service (2 million+ federal employees).  
     – Concentrate power in political loyalists across agencies.  
  8. Economy  
     – Undermine data collection, politicize the Federal Reserve, and restrict free trade.  
  9. Immigration and Border Policy  
     – End asylum, slash legal immigration channels, expand mass detention and deportations.  
  10. Justice Department  
     – Politicize the DOJ to refuse defense of key rights in court, cementing other Project 2025 goals.  
  11. National Security and Foreign Policy  
     – Centralize military decision-making, weaken intelligence agencies, and pursue isolationist policies.

• Projected Consequences  
  – Up to 220,000 American jobs lost.  
  – Broad erosion of Americans’ wages, rights, and protections—particularly harming low-income communities, people of color, women, immigrants, veterans, and public-sector workers.  
  – Potential legal challenges may slow but not necessarily block these actions given far-right influence on the courts.

• Call to Action  
  – Democracy Forward urges readers to understand these plans, share the guide, and support efforts to defend democratic institutions and build a more inclusive future.

<Summary source="https://humanrightsfirst.org/library/project-2025-subvert-democracy/">
Here is a concise summary of the Human Rights First guest post “Project 2025 is on track to subvert American democracy,” written by UCLA law student Andrew Beale:

1. Project 2025 Overview  
- A 900-plus-page policy proposal from the Heritage Foundation aiming to reshape the federal government along ultraconservative, authoritarian lines.  
- Organized by federal agency (“Central Personnel Agencies,” “Intelligence Community,” etc.), but explicitly envisions close federal–state coordination to push through unpopular measures.

2. Authoritarian Federal–State Agenda  
- Foreword declares parents’ rights as “non-negotiable,” urging cutting off federal funds to any state or local entity that disagrees.  
- Calls for state legislators to join federal efforts, e.g., to impose a nationwide abortion ban.

3. School Libraries & “Indoctrination”  
- Human Rights First’s Democracy Watch Tracker (DWT) has logged 40 state and 2 federal bills in 2025 targeting school libraries.  
- Example: Say No to Indoctrination Act (Reps. Burgess Owens, R-UT, and John McGuire, R-VA) would bar schools from using federal funds to discuss “gender ideology.”

4. Reproductive Rights Rollback  
- DWT counted 10 federal and 366 state bills in 2025 aiming to restrict abortion.  
- Example: New Mexico’s “Every Mother Matters Act” would require providers to offer detailed information on “potential risks and long-term consequences” of abortion.  
- The article notes abortion is over ten times safer than childbirth, and bans correlate with increased pregnancy-related complications.

5. Attacks on DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Accessibility)  
- DWT logged 10 federal and 159 state bills targeting DEIA initiatives.  
- Texas H.B. 4499 would give governor-appointed university boards broad control over curricula and hiring.  
- Iowa H.S.B. 155 would ban state spending on teaching various critical-race and social-justice concepts and create a private right of action to enforce the ban.

6. Federal Civics Education Restriction  
- The proposed PEACE Act (Protect Equality And Civics Education Act of 2025) would bar American History and Civics Education funds from supporting any “divisive concept” (e.g., U.S. history of racism).

7. Immigration Enforcement Intensification  
- Project 2025 emphasizes “prioritizing border security and immigration enforcement, including detention and deportation.”  
- DWT logged 49 federal and 235 state bills in 2025 targeting immigrants’ rights.  
- Example: Florida S.B. 2-C creates a State Board of Immigration Enforcement and empowers the state AG to enforce immigration detainers in court.

8. External Commentary  
- Paul Dans, former head of Project 2025, praised Trump’s use of the document to date: “If Roosevelt had the New Deal, this is what I would think of as Trump’s real deal,” he told NBC News.

Bottom line: The guest post argues that Project 2025 provides a detailed federal–state playbook for rolling back nearly a century of democratic gains on voting, education, reproductive rights, diversity initiatives, and immigrants’ protections.

Summary of “Project 2025, Explained” (American Civil Liberties Union)

1. Background  
• Project 2025 is a policy “roadmap” authored in 2022 by The Heritage Foundation and 140 former Trump staffers, outlining how a second Trump administration would replace current legal norms with conservative “America First” priorities.  
• The ACLU characterizes many recommendations as extreme or unconstitutional and warns they would erode civil rights and liberties.

2. Scope of Recommendations  
• Hundreds of policy changes spanning:  
  – Immigration (e.g. expanded detention, stricter enforcement)  
  – Abortion rights (e.g. bans, elimination of federal support for comprehensive sex education)  
  – Free speech and voting rights (e.g. laws to restrict discussion in schools, measures to disenfranchise voters)  
  – Racial justice and civil rights (e.g. dismantling the Civil Rights Division of DOJ)  
  – Privacy and surveillance (e.g. continuation or expansion of contested electronic intelligence gathering)  
  – Federal agency structure (e.g. abolish the Gender Policy Council; break up or radically reorganize cabinet departments)

3. Key Individuals and Roles (“Second Trump Administration Connections”)  
• Pam Bondi (former Florida Attorney General):  
  – Defended Trump during first impeachment; upheld Florida’s abortion ban  
  – Named a Project 2025 supporter and potential U.S. Attorney General nominee  
• Russell Vought (listed as OMB Director):  
  – Co-author of Project 2025 chapters on the Executive Office  
  – Advocated abolishing the Gender Policy Council to eliminate federal promotion of abortion and sex ed  
  – Pledged to enforce and implement presidential policy across government  
• Other unnamed contributors:  
  – Fox News contributor tied to anti-abortion disinformation and Paragon Health Institute  
  – Deputy chief of staff advising on policy implementation  
  – Officials linked to the America First Policy Institute’s Center for Law and Justice, focused on voter restrictions  
  – Education figures proposing to shift authority to states, expand private school vouchers, and endorse anti-trans policies

4. ACLU’s Response and Action Plan  
• Released a series of seven memos detailing civil-rights threats posed by Project 2025’s agenda  
• Pledges to use:  
  – Litigation (suing to block unconstitutional measures)  
  – Advocacy (targeting Congress to defend privacy, voting rights, bodily autonomy)  
  – Community organizing (mobilizing public opposition)  
• Calls to supporters include:  
  – Urging Congress to close ICE detention facilities  
  – Pressuring lawmakers to curb government surveillance abuses  
  – Demanding protections for voting access and educational freedom  
  – Opposing legislation that restricts discussion of race, gender, or sexual orientation in schools

<Summary source="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/30/trump-nominee-disavows-noaa-break-up-plan-project-2025">
Here are the key points from the January 30, 2025 Axios article by Andrew Freedman:

1. Context  
   • Project 2025—a conservative governing blueprint widely discussed in Trump–aligned circles—recommended dissolving NOAA, moving some functions to other federal agencies and privatizing the National Weather Service.  
   • At the time of the article, NOAA remained a primary component of the Commerce Department, handling hurricane and climate research, severe weather warnings, and endangered species protection.

2. Main development  
   • Howard Lutnick, President Biden’s nominee for Commerce secretary, explicitly rejected Project 2025’s plan to break up NOAA during his Senate confirmation hearing.  

3. Quotations from the hearing (Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee)  
   • When asked if he agrees with Project 2025’s NOAA-dissolution proposal, Lutnick said: “No.”  
   • On rumors of an executive order to move NOAA’s oceans programs to the Interior Department, Lutnick indicated opposition.  
   • In response to Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) asking if he would fight any effort to separate parts of NOAA from Commerce, he stated: “I have no interest in separating it. That is not on my agenda.”

4. Significance  
   • NOAA represents the bulk of the Commerce Department’s budget outside of census years, making its structure and funding a substantial part of Commerce’s mission and capabilities.

No additional objectives or timeline changes regarding Project 2025’s NOAA proposal were reported in this article.

<Summary source="https://abcnews.go.com/US/doge-now-access-noaas-systems-reviewing-dei-program/story?id=118493866">
Here is a concise summary of the ABC News article “DOGE now has access to NOAA’s IT systems; reviewing DEI program, sources say”:

Facts and developments  
• At least one member of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been granted access to NOAA’s IT systems within the Department of Commerce. According to U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and confirmed by Reps. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and NOAA employees, DOGE was initially denied but now can review NOAA servers.  
• DOGE is specifically searching for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) materials—poster­s, bulletin board items and bathroom signage—to ensure compliance with President Trump’s executive orders.  
• Democratic committee staff warn that making personnel changes or dismantling NOAA without Congressional authorization would be unlawful; the House Science, Space and Technology Committee is investigating whether these actions mirror previous “USAID situation” disruptions.  
• Multiple key NOAA websites (including the Mauna Loa Observatory CO₂ dataset) were briefly offline. NOAA’s public information officer at the David Skaggs Research Center attributed this to scheduled maintenance and a temporary power outage.  
• NOAA oversees the National Weather Service (primary U.S. meteorological forecasts) and the National Centers for Environmental Information (the world’s largest repository of weather and climate data). Emergency managers and climate researchers (e.g., South Carolina Emergency Management’s Andrew Phillips; Jennifer Brady of Climate Central) emphasize NOAA’s critical role in public safety and scientific research.  

Opinions from named sources  
• Reps. Huffman and Lofgren (press statement): “Elon Musk and his DOGE hackers are ransacking their way through the federal government, unlawfully gaining unfettered access to Americans’ private information and gutting programs people depend on… wreaking havoc on the scientific and regulatory systems that protect American families’ safety and jobs.”  
• Former NOAA employee (unnamed): Concerned DOGE may “break things now and fix them later,” risking damage or loss of irreplaceable climate and weather data, potentially following a “Project 2025” playbook.  

Project 2025 context  
• Project 2025—developed by The Heritage Foundation pre-2024 election—called for breaking up NOAA and commercializing its forecast operations, arguing NOAA’s current structure “corrupts its useful functions” and harms U.S. prosperity.  
• Trump publicly disavowed Project 2025; his OMB nominee Russell Vought was one of its authors.  
• Commerce nominee Howard Lutnick told senators he would not implement Project 2025’s recommendations nor break up NOAA; he awaits a final confirmation vote.

<Summary source="https://thefulcrum.us/governance-legislation/project-2025-noaa">
Here are the key points from The Fulcrum’s October 30, 2024 article “Project 2025 would have ‘catastrophic’ impact on hurricane warnings”:

Facts and background  
• Residents across the southeastern U.S. are still recovering from back-to-back hurricanes.  
• NOAA’s roles today include:  
  – Collecting massive weather and climate data through satellites, field stations and research centers  
  – Running its own forecasting models (National Weather Service, National Hurricane Center)  
  – Issuing official extreme-weather warnings (the only agency with that authority)  
  – Making all data and forecasts freely available to the public  
• NOAA’s fiscal 2024 proposed budget allocates over half of the Department of Commerce budget to NOAA and its sub-organizations.  
• NOAA currently provides hurricane-track forecasts up to five days in advance.  

Project 2025’s proposals regarding NOAA  
• The Project 2025 planning document (chapter on Commerce, authored by Thomas Gilman, former Commerce Department CFO and now director at the American Center for Law and Justice) calls to “break up NOAA,” arguing:  
  – Its bureaucracy is “far too hefty” and has become “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.”  
  – Its emphasis on prediction and management represents “the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.”  
• It would separate NOAA’s branches (e.g., National Ocean Service, research wing, National Weather Service, Hurricane Center) rather than keeping them integrated.  
• It urges the NWS to “fully commercialize its forecasting operations,” putting forecast data behind paywalls.  
• A Project 2025 spokesperson says the plan “does not call for the elimination of NOAA or the NWS,” and that using “commercial products to provide a better result for taxpayers at a lower cost is nothing new.”  

Named expert concerns  
• Kerry Emanuel (professor emeritus of atmospheric science, MIT):  
  “It would be potentially catastrophic if you had more than one authority agency … giving you opposite instructions on what to do or opposite warnings. Uniformity in warnings keeps people safe.”  
• Rachel Cleetus (policy director, climate and energy program, Union of Concerned Scientists):  
  NOAA’s integrated branches and long-term data are essential for accurate hurricane and climate modeling; fragmenting them would degrade forecast quality.  
  “When you have data that people depend on for emergency purposes … if that data is put behind a paywall, it will just become less accessible to people who need it, and that can have life-threatening consequences.”  
• Jeff Masters (former NWS meteorologist, staff writer at Yale Climate Connections):  
  Recounting his 2005 opposition to a bill that would have restricted free NWS forecasts: “We quickly saw that that was a societal loss… Charging for forecast information would disproportionately harm low-income populations.”  

Other context  
• At least 140 people who served in the first Trump administration have contributed to Project 2025, according to a CNN review.  
• Former President Trump denies any connection to the plan; his team is reportedly preparing a blacklist of people to keep out of a second Trump term, some of whom have ties to Project 2025 (Politico).  

Overall, experts warn that Project 2025’s push to break up and commercialize NOAA could undermine the uniform, publicly accessible forecasts and warnings that save lives in hurricane-prone regions.

Query: What is the Keep_Track subreddit’s Project 2025 Tracker? Describe its objective‐setting and completion criteria, the rate and timing at which items have historically moved from “in progress” to “complete,” and the history and current status of the “break up NOAA” objective.
# The Keep_Track Subreddit’s Project 2025 Tracker: Objectives, Progress, and NOAA Analysis  

## Overview of the Project 2025 Tracker  
The **Project 2025 Tracker** (project2025.observer) is a community-driven initiative originating from the Reddit subreddit r/Keep_Track, which focuses on documenting policy changes and executive actions during the Trump administration[25][26][29]. Created by users u/rusticgorilla and u/mollynaquafina, the platform aims to monitor the implementation of the Heritage Foundation’s *Project 2025* agenda—a 922-page blueprint for restructuring federal agencies and advancing conservative priorities[25][40][42].  

### Objective-Setting and Completion Criteria  
The tracker identifies **297 objectives** derived from explicit policy recommendations in the *Project 2025* document[25][26]. Each objective is categorized by agency (e.g., Department of Commerce, Environmental Protection Agency) and assigned one of three statuses:  
1. **Completed**: Policy changes finalized via executive orders, legislative action, or departmental directives.  
2. **In Progress**: Initiatives undergoing implementation (e.g., staffing changes, regulatory revisions).  
3. **Not Started**: Proposals not yet acted upon[25][33][38].  

Criteria for marking objectives as "completed" include:  
- Issuance of executive orders or memoranda (e.g., rescinding Biden-era Title IX rules)[25][33].  
- Legislative action (e.g., Senate confirmations of Project 2025-aligned appointees)[50].  
- Operational changes within agencies (e.g., restructuring offices, defunding programs)[57][59].  

As of May 2025, **36% of objectives** (107/297) were marked "completed," with an additional 15% (45/297) "in progress"[25][38].  

---

## Historical Progress and Timing  
### Rate of Completion  
- **February 2025**: 36% completion rate reported, emphasizing early executive actions targeting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Department of Energy[25].  
- **April 2025**: Progress increased to 42% (124/297 objectives), driven by rapid rulemaking in the Department of Homeland Security (e.g., immigration enforcement partnerships) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (cryptocurrency deregulation)[29][33].  
- **May 2025**: Momentum slowed slightly, with 5–8 objectives completed monthly, including military personnel policies (e.g., expelling transgender service members)[33].  

### Transition from "In Progress" to "Complete"  
The average time for objectives to transition from "in progress" to "complete" is **45–60 days**, depending on agency complexity. For example:  
- **Rescinding NOAA’s climate initiatives** (April 2025): Took 21 days from proposal to implementation[59][63].  
- **DOJ subpoena policy changes** (April 25, 2025): Finalized in 14 days after internal review[33].  

Delays often occur in objectives requiring Senate confirmation (e.g., NOAA restructuring) or legal challenges (e.g., CFPB funding)[50][61].  

---

## The "Break Up NOAA" Objective  
### Background  
The *Project 2025* blueprint calls for dismantling the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**, arguing it perpetuates "climate alarmism"[59][63]. Specific recommendations include:  
- Eliminating NOAA’s climate research programs.  
- Transferring the National Weather Service (NWS) to the Department of Commerce.  
- Defunding satellites and CO2 monitoring systems[59][63].  

### Implementation Status  
- **February 2025**: The administration began firing NOAA employees and shuttering regional offices, citing "budget efficiencies"[57][65].  
- **April 2025**: Key NOAA websites (e.g., Mauna Loa CO2 datasets) went offline during IT system audits by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)[61].  
- **May 2025**: The objective remains "in progress," delayed by Senate confirmation hearings for NOAA’s proposed leadership[59][65].  

### Current Challenges  
- **Legal battles**: Lawsuits from environmental groups argue that dismantling NOAA violates the National Climate Assessment Act[59][63].  
- **Operational disruptions**: NWS forecasting accuracy declined by 12% during restructuring, per internal reports[61].

<Summary source="https://envirodatagov.org/project-2025-national-oceanic-and-atmospheric-administration-annotated/">
Here’s a concise summary of the EDGI-annotated excerpt on “Break Up NOAA” (Chapter 21 of Project 2025), by Scout Blum and Christopher Sellers:

Source  
- Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI), annotated by the Environmental Historians Action Collaborative.  

Key Facts & Statistics  
- NOAA is the largest non-Census agency in the Commerce Department in non-decennial years.  
- In 2021, NOAA received $6.5 billion of Commerce’s $12 billion annual operational budget and employed over half of the department’s personnel (outside Census years).  

Major Recommendations (“Break Up NOAA” and related reforms)  
1. Break up and downsize NOAA, arguing its mix of environmental information, stewardship, and research functions could be delivered more cheaply and efficiently by the private sector.  
2. Refocus the National Weather Service (NWS) on raw data-gathering and fully commercialize forecasting operations—citing private forecasters (e.g., AccuWeather) as more reliable.  
3. Review the National Hurricane Center and National Environmental Satellite Service to ensure neutral, uninterrupted data continuity.  
4. Transfer National Ocean Service (NOS) survey functions (historically ~50% of NOS budget) to the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Geological Survey; review expansion of National Marine Sanctuaries.  
5. Streamline overlap between the National Marine Fisheries Service (saltwater) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (freshwater).  
6. Harmonize the Magnuson–Stevens Fisheries Conservation Act with the National Marine Sanctuaries Act to resolve conflicts over no-fishing zones.  
7. Withdraw the 30×30 Executive Order and America the Beautiful Initiative, which aim to close large ocean areas to commercial activity and promote offshore wind.  
8. Modify Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act regulations to reduce burdens on fisheries and Native American subsistence.  
9. Exempt fisheries actions from NEPA’s redundant procedural requirements, relying instead on Magnuson–Stevens Act impact analyses.  
10. Downsize the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), critiqued as the source of “climate alarmism,” and consolidate its labs and research centers.  
11. Break up the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), reassigning ships and aircraft to GSA or other agencies.  
12. Use small innovation prizes and competitions to spur commercial R&D and diversify NOAA partnerships.  
13. Ensure political appointees in NOAA align fully with Administration policy to avoid “obstructionism.”  
14. Elevate the Office of Space Commerce to drive a unified, pro-commercial U.S. space policy.  

Reliability notes  
- The annotations are from EDGI, a research and public-interest organization. Recommendations reflect Project 2025’s policy agenda; supporting evidence ranges from budget figures (2021) to unnamed “studies” on forecast accuracy.

<Summary source="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/15/nx-s1-5297183/noaa-national-weather-service-trump">
Here’s a concise summary of the NPR article “Trump officials signal potential changes at NOAA, the weather and climate agency” (Feb. 15, 2025):

• Context & Concerns  
  – NOAA employees are “on high alert” for major reorganization, potential staff cuts and funding slashes under the Trump administration.  
  – Agency staff have been handed (anonymously reported) a list of grant- and program-related terms to avoid—e.g. “climate change,” “pollution,” “natural resources,” and diversity-related language—so as not to conflict with recent executive orders.

• NOAA’s Scope  
  – Houses the National Hurricane Center, National Weather Service, ocean and atmospheric research offices, and the National Marine Fisheries Service.  
  – Provides weather forecasts (tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, tsunamis), marine charts for recreation, and fisheries management.

• Project 2025 Blueprint  
  – A 900+-page plan led by the Heritage Foundation labels NOAA “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry.”  
  – Recommends breaking the agency up, drastically cutting its budget, and privatizing weather-forecasting functions.  
  – Several Project 2025 authors now occupy senior roles in the Trump administration; many recent executive actions mirror its proposals.

• Historical Precedents  
  – Past administrations have discussed moving NOAA out of Commerce or splitting off Fisheries into Fish and Wildlife.  
  – In Trump’s first term, there was interest in privatizing weather forecasting and related technologies.

• Leadership Changes  
  – Neil Jacobs (atmospheric scientist; former acting NOAA head) is nominated to lead NOAA again. He’s respected scientifically but was faulted by an independent panel after NOAA’s 2019 “Sharpiegate” statement backing Trump’s incorrect Hurricane Dorian claims.  
  – Taylor Jordan has been nominated to a key NOAA post; his weather-tech background makes this pairing (with Jacobs) depart from the usual weather-expert plus fisheries/coasts mix, per former NOAA official Craig McLean.

• Congressional Oversight  
  – During Howard Lutnick’s Commerce Secretary confirmation, Democrats (led by Sen. Maria Cantwell) pressed him on Project 2025’s call to dismantle NOAA.  
  – Lutnick replied it’s “premature to discuss any specific recommendations” before further engagement with NOAA, OMB and Commerce.  
  – His nomination advanced largely along party lines (all Republicans plus Sen. John Fetterman voted yes).

• Named Voices  
  – Andy Rosenberg (former NOAA official): underscores the agency’s vital role in everyday forecasts, marine safety and fisheries.  
  – A NOAA contractor (speaking anonymously): “The mood’s lower than I’ve ever seen it… there’s a lot of fear in the office.”  
  – Juan Declet-Barreto (Union of Concerned Scientists): warns that crippling NOAA could jeopardize access to life-saving weather and climate data, leaving only the wealthy able to afford private sources.

Here is a concise summary of the Project 2025 Wikipedia article. I’ve focused only on material in the article and noted key facts, named sources, and a few notable opinions.  

• Overview  
  – Project 2025 is the Heritage Foundation’s ninth “Mandate for Leadership” blueprint, launched in 2022 under director Paul Dans.  
  – It rests on a “unitary executive” theory holding that the president should have full control over the executive branch.  

• Stated Objectives  
  – Replace merit-based federal civil servants with Trump loyalists.  
  – Take partisan control of DOJ, FBI, Department of Commerce, FTC; dismantle DHS and Department of Education.  
  – Roll back environmental regulations (favor fossil fuels) and reduce NIH independence, including defunding stem-cell research.  
  – Cut corporate taxes, institute a flat income tax, trim Medicare/Medicaid, and reverse President Biden’s policies.  
  – Criminalize pornography; remove legal protections against anti-LGBT discrimination; end DEI programs while prosecuting “anti-white racism.”  
  – Enforce mass deportation of undocumented immigrants; deploy U.S. military for domestic law enforcement.  
  – Enact Christian-right priorities: criminalize abortion and birth-control medications; eliminate emergency-contraception coverage.  

• Personnel & Influence  
  – Most contributors served in Trump’s 2017–2021 administration or 2024 campaign.  
  – Heritage Foundation spent $22 million on staffing recommendations—far above its usual—and coordinated with over 100 partner organizations by February 2024.  
  – The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) identified seven partners as hate or extremist groups.  
  – After Trump’s 2024 victory, several Project 2025 architects were nominated to administration posts. Time magazine (July 2024) found that nearly two-thirds of Trump’s early second-term executive actions “mirror or partially mirror” Project 2025 proposals.  

• Leadership & Trump’s Role  
  – Project president Kevin Roberts describes it as “institutionalizing Trumpism.”  
  – Trump publicly distanced himself (July 2024), though campaign materials (Agenda 47) and Heritage’s briefings suggest close alignment.  
  – Vice President J.D. Vance wrote the foreword to Roberts’s book on Project 2025; Russell Vought’s Center for Renewing America is on its advisory board.  

• Criticism & Legal Concerns  
  – Critics label it authoritarian and Christian nationalist, warning it would undermine the rule of law, separation of powers, church–state separation, civil liberties, and environmental protections.  
  – Some legal experts say it threatens the merit-based civil service and could violate laws or protocols to achieve its goals.  

Named Sources  
  – Time magazine analysis of executive actions (July 2024)  
  – Southern Poverty Law Center identification of extremist partners  

Less-Reliable/Unnamed Opinions  
  – Political commentators (e.g. Robert Reich, Michael Steele, Olivia Troye) dismissed Trump’s denials of involvement.

Article: “A Day Without NOAA, a Day Without the National Weather Service?”  
Source: The Equation (Union of Concerned Scientists blog)  
Date: February 12, 2025  
Authors: Dr. Astrid Caldas et al.

1. Context & Main Thesis  
- Project 2025 (Trump administration blueprint) proposes dismantling/privatizing essential services of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  
- Loss of NOAA’s publicly funded weather, climate, marine and fisheries data would impair life-saving forecasts and planning.

2. Key Facts & Statistics  
- Great Blizzard of 1888 (historical precedent): up to 58″ of snow; >400 dead; widespread paralysis of East Coast transport; post-storm flooding.  
- NOAA self-assessment (2022): since 2000, its 72-hour hurricane track error fell by 57%; intensity-prediction error dropped by 40%.  
- 2024 hurricane season: NOAA’s accurate early tracks for Hurricanes Helene and Milton enabled timely evacuations, saving lives/property.  
- 2024 U.S. climate- and weather-related disasters: 27 events ≥ $1 billion each, 568 deaths, total cost $182.7 billion.  
- Billion-dollar disaster annual averages: 1980–2024 = 9; 2020–2024 = 23.

3. Impacts of Dismantling NOAA (as outlined in the article)  
a. Extreme Weather Alerts & Forecasts  
  • Schools, emergency responders, farmers, businesses, outdoor workers and the public depend on free, accurate NOAA data to plan for heat waves, storms, winter weather, etc.  

b. Hurricane Forecasts  
  • National Hurricane Center data underpin evacuation orders, shelter planning, and infrastructure protection.  
  • Rising hurricane destructiveness (stronger winds, higher rainfall, rapid intensification) heightens reliance on NOAA forecasts.  

c. Wildfire, Precipitation & Drought Outlooks  
  • National Weather Service provides daily and seasonal outlooks that guide resource allocation (e.g., road salting, fire-management, water-use restrictions).  

d. Fisheries Management  
  • National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) data help set sustainable catch limits, protect ocean ecosystems, and support both domestic and international fisheries.  

e. Climate-Impact Science  
  • NOAA reports and analyses inform understanding of climate change trends and escalating socioeconomic costs.  

4. Opinions & Interpretations (from named source)  
- Dr. Astrid Caldas & co-authors (The Equation/UCS): Dismantling NOAA “is alarming on many fronts,” especially given escalating climate risks.  
- “One of our most powerful tools against fierce, deadly weather is the ability to predict where it will affect us. That is what this administration threatens to take away.”  

5. Framing & Rationale  
- NOAA is a taxpayer-funded public good, “for the people, not special interests.”  
- The proposal comes at a “perilous time” as climate-driven extreme events increase in frequency, severity and cost.

<Summary source="https://abcnews.go.com/US/privatize-national-weather-service/story?id=119871559">
Here’s a distilled summary of the ABC News article, organized by the types of information sought:

1. Facts, statistics and other objective measurements  
• Project 2025 blueprint: a 922-page set of policy proposals published during Trump’s 2020 campaign includes language that NOAA “should be broken up and downsized” and that the NWS “should fully commercialize its forecasting operations.”  
• National Weather Service (NWS) annual operating budget: $1.3 billion (roughly $4 per American).  
• U.S. defense budget (for comparison): over $800 billion per year.  
• NWS hardware: network of 159 weather radars plus coast-to-coast surface observation sites.  
• Data volume: more than 6.3 billion observations collected and analyzed per day.  
• Outputs: about 1.5 million forecasts and 50,000 warnings issued per year.  
• History: NWS has been tracking and warning on weather for 150 years.  
• NOAA footprint: roughly 620 facilities nationwide.  
• Pending cuts (according to multiple unnamed sources): over 1,000 NOAA layoffs; exploring early termination of some facility leases; elimination or reduction of weather-balloon launches at eight northern sites.

2. Opinions from reliable, named sources  
• Jan Null (professor of meteorology, San Jose State University):  
  – “The overreaching goal of government should be providing basic health and safety information to protect human lives and property. That’s in the core mission statement of the National Weather Service — to save lives and property.”  
  – Return on investment from NWS: about 73 to 1.  
  – “I don’t see any way that the private industry could replicate [this].”  
• Ginger Zee (ABC News Chief Meteorologist and Chief Climate Correspondent):  
  – NWS “provides basic, integral information with the aim to protect the public rather than make a profit.”  
  – Smartphone weather apps, local schools, police, firehouses, city planners and emergency directors all rely on NWS data.  
  – “It runs all weather, everywhere, because it’s free.”  
• AccuWeather (private-sector forecasting company): in a statement, said a “multi-sector approach to weather forecasting” — not full privatization — is needed to save lives and property.  
• Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (during January confirmation hearing):  
  – Does not support dismantling NOAA or NWS.  
  – Believes NWS can “deliver the project more efficiently and less expensively.”  
  – When asked about Project 2025 privatization proposals, answered “No.”

3. Potentially useful opinions from less reliable or unnamed sources  
• “Experts said” (not individually named) that fully privatizing the NWS could endanger Americans by limiting public access to life-threatening weather and climate information (e.g., storm surges, hurricane wind speeds, tornado warnings).  
• Multiple “sources familiar with the matter” (not named) told ABC News that NOAA is preparing over 1,000 layoffs and considering early lease terminations.  
• Democrats and “former NOAA leadership officials” (present at a news conference, not individually named) raised concerns that these cuts threaten NOAA’s ability to deliver lifesaving forecasting services.

<Summary source="https://www.news-press.com/story/opinion/2024/08/11/project-2025-threatens-floridas-climate-science-public-safety/74713450007/">
Here’s a concise extraction of the key points from the July 2024 News-Press opinion piece by Mary Anna Mancuso (political strategist and Republic En. org spokesperson), distributed via The Invading Sea website:

1. Objective & Context  
• Project 2025 (a Heritage Foundation–inspired “blueprint”) proposes shrinking or eliminating federal agencies associated with climate science, including NOAA and its sub-agency, the National Weather Service (NWS).  
• On p. 675 of the blueprint, authors label NOAA’s six main offices “a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry” and assert NOAA “corrupts its useful functions. It should be broken up and downsized.”

2. Facts & Statistics  
• Florida has over 1,300 miles of coastline, making it highly vulnerable to tropical storms and sea-level rise.  
• In 2022 Florida’s tourism industry contributed more than $100 billion to the state economy.  
• The fishing industry relies on NOAA’s oceanographic research for sustainable practices.

3. Functions at Risk  
• Hurricane forecasting and early warnings (via the National Hurricane Center)  
• Hazardous-weather alerts to the public  
• Long-term climate monitoring and sea-level research  
• Data underpinning public policy, private-sector risk assessment, and investment decisions  
• Participation in international climate-monitoring networks and agreements

4. Arguments & Opinions  
Reliable/Named Sources  
• Mary Anna Mancuso (op-ed author): Eliminating NOAA/NWS “would put countless Americans…in peril’s way” by removing vital forecasting and research capabilities.  
• Project 2025 proponents (Heritage Foundation–inspired blueprint): Claim agency cuts would “streamline government and reduce spending.”

Less-Reliable/Unnamed Perspectives  
• The article alludes to generic proponents who view NOAA as part of a “climate change alarm industry,” but does not name individuals beyond the blueprint authors.

5. Potential Impacts Highlighted  
• Public safety: Reduced early-warning capacity for hurricanes and floods.  
• Economic stability: Threats to tourism and fishing sectors dependent on accurate weather/climate data.  
• Environmental policy: Loss of decades of scientific progress, creation of a “knowledge gap.”  
• International cooperation: Weakened U.S. leadership in global climate monitoring and agreements.

Bottom-Line Message  
Mancuso argues that, despite possible efficiency gains from trimming some agencies, fully dismantling NOAA and NWS is short-sighted, endangers lives and economy—especially in climate-vulnerable states like Florida—and sacrifices long-term preparedness for ideological goals.

- Explains proposals to separate NOAA branches and commercialize forecasting operations
- Includes expert opinions (MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel, UCS policy director Rachel Cleetus) warning about negative impacts
- Quality: Medium-High - detailed on proposal but predates implementation

**Perplexity Report**
- Claims 36% of Project 2025 objectives (107/297) were completed as of May 2025, with 15% (45/297) "in progress"
- Reports the "break up NOAA" objective remains "in progress" as of May 2025
- States average transition time from "in progress" to "complete" is 45-60 days
- Describes specific actions regarding NOAA since February 2025
- Quality: Potentially valuable but requires caution - contains specific claims not verified in other sources

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

1. **Project 2025 objectives overall**: According to the Perplexity report, 36% completion rate as of May 2025 provides a baseline.

2. **Agency reorganization objectives**: Breaking up a major agency likely requires more complex implementation than policy changes via executive orders.

3. **Department of Commerce priorities**: NOAA represents the bulk of Commerce's budget outside census years (Axios), suggesting its restructuring would be significant and potentially face internal resistance.

4. **Objectives facing legal challenges**: The Perplexity report mentions environmental groups' lawsuits, which could delay implementation.

The most suitable reference class appears to be agency reorganization objectives (#2), as NOAA restructuring represents a complex, multi-step process rather than a simple policy change.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

- We have 45 days from today (May 15, 2025) until the resolution date (July 1, 2025)
- The Perplexity report claims 45-60 days as average transition time from "in progress" to "complete"
- If the "break up NOAA" objective is currently "in progress," this timeframe places completion right at the edge of our resolution deadline
- Given the complexity of dismantling a major agency with critical weather and climate functions, implementation likely requires more time than average objectives

## (d) Justification:

Several factors suggest the NOAA breakup objective is unlikely to be completed by July 1:

1. **Current implementation status**: While DOGE has accessed NOAA's IT systems (confirmed by ABC News), this represents preliminary steps rather than substantial restructuring.

2. **Complex nature of NOAA**: NOAA houses critical functions including the National Weather Service and hurricane forecasting. As experts in The Fulcrum article noted, fragmenting these integrated operations presents technical and logistical challenges beyond typical policy changes.

3. **Leadership opposition**: Howard Lutnick (Commerce nominee) explicitly stated he "has no interest in separating" NOAA from Commerce (Axios). If confirmed, this internal resistance could slow implementation.

4. **Legal barriers**: Environmental groups have reportedly filed lawsuits (Perplexity), which could delay full implementation even if procedural steps are underway.

5. **Public safety considerations**: Weather forecasting and hurricane warnings are life-safety functions, making rapid dismantling politically risky during hurricane season (which begins June 1).

Against these factors, the current administration appears committed to implementing Project 2025 objectives, with DOGE actively reviewing NOAA systems. However, marking the objective "complete" would likely require more substantial reorganization than what appears to have happened to date.

## Outside view calibration:

The Perplexity report suggests 36% of Project 2025 objectives have been completed over approximately 4-5 months of implementation. This indicates a completion rate of roughly 7-9% per month.

Given:
- 45 days until deadline (1.5 months)
- The objective is reportedly "in progress" but involves complex agency restructuring
- Legal challenges and potential leadership opposition 
- The apparent complexity beyond average objectives

I estimate there's approximately a 20-25% chance of completion by July 1. The 45-60 day reported transition time puts this objective right at the boundary of our deadline, but the numerous complicating factors (legal challenges, complexity, hurricane season timing) tilt the probability downward from what would otherwise be closer to 50%.

## Outside View Prediction:
22%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Democracy Forward's "The People's Guide to Project 2025"**: A critical overview of Project 2025's broad policy ambitions, published by an advocacy organization opposed to the project. While it mentions environmental policy changes as a category, it lacks specific information about NOAA. **Quality**: Medium - provides general context but is partisan and lacks NOAA-specific details.

2. **Human Rights First guest post**: Similar to above, provides a partisan critique of Project 2025's overall agenda focusing on democratic institutions, civil rights, and immigration. No mention of NOAA. **Quality**: Low for our specific question.

3. **ACLU's "Project 2025, Explained"**: Another critical analysis from a civil liberties perspective, mentioning plans to "break up or radically reorganize cabinet departments" without NOAA specifics. **Quality**: Medium for general context, low for our specific question.

4. **Axios article (Jan 30, 2025)**: Directly addresses the NOAA question, reporting that Commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick explicitly rejected Project 2025's plan to break up NOAA during his confirmation hearing. **Quality**: High - provides factual reporting on official statements directly related to our question.

5. **ABC News article**: Reports that DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) has gained access to NOAA's IT systems and is reviewing DEI programs. Mentions Project 2025's recommendation to break up NOAA and reiterates Lutnick's opposition. **Quality**: High - provides factual reporting on current administrative actions affecting NOAA.

6. **The Fulcrum article (Oct 30, 2024)**: Discusses Project 2025's NOAA proposal in detail, including expert concerns from named scientists. **Quality**: Medium-high - provides specific details about the proposed breakup, though from pre-election.

7. **Perplexity report**: Most valuable for our question, providing data about the Project 2025 Tracker itself. Reports that as of May 2025, 36% of objectives were completed (107/297) and 15% were in progress (45/297). Crucially states that the "Break Up NOAA" objective remained "in progress" as of May 2025, with implementation steps occurring but completion delayed by confirmation hearings. **Quality**: High - directly addresses tracking metrics and current status.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several potential reference classes emerge:

1. **Overall Project 2025 objective completion rate**: 36% completed in approximately 4-5 months of the administration.

2. **Transition time from "in progress" to "complete"**: According to the Perplexity report, typically 45-60 days for Project 2025 objectives.

3. **Agency restructuring timelines**: The Perplexity report mentions "Rescinding NOAA's climate initiatives" took 21 days in April 2025, while other restructuring objectives have faced delays due to confirmation processes.

The most suitable reference class is #2 (transition time from "in progress" to "complete") since we know the objective is already "in progress" and we need to predict completion within a specific timeframe.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction timeframe is approximately 45 days (May 15 to July 1, 2025). According to our reference class, objectives typically take 45-60 days to transition from "in progress" to "complete." This places our deadline right at the lower boundary of the expected completion window.

The Perplexity report indicates implementation is already underway with:
- NOAA employee terminations
- Regional office closures
- IT systems auditing
- Website disruptions

However, completion is reportedly delayed by Senate confirmation hearings for proposed NOAA leadership and legal challenges from environmental groups.

## (d) Justification:

Based on the available information, several factors inform my outside view:

**Factors favoring completion before July 1:**
- The objective is already "in progress" with concrete implementation steps occurring
- Some NOAA-related actions have been implemented quickly (21 days for climate initiatives)
- DOGE involvement suggests administrative prioritization
- 45 days is within the lower bound of the typical completion window (45-60 days)

**Factors against completion before July 1:**
- Breaking up a major agency is complex and likely requires more than average time
- Senate confirmation hearings are explicitly cited as causing delays
- Legal challenges from environmental groups may further slow implementation
- The Commerce Secretary nominee publicly opposed breaking up NOAA

Given these considerations, completion by July 1 appears possible but faces significant hurdles that make it less than 50% likely.

## Outside view calibration:

The most relevant figure from the sources is the 45-60 day average transition time from "in progress" to "complete" for Project 2025 objectives. With 45 days until our deadline, this suggests approximately a 50% baseline probability if the NOAA breakup were an average objective.

However, several factors suggest this objective faces more challenges than average:
1. Agency restructuring is likely more complex than typical policy changes
2. Explicit legal challenges are mentioned
3. Senate confirmation delays are specifically cited
4. Cabinet-level opposition has been publicly stated

These factors collectively reduce the probability from the 50% baseline. The implementation steps already underway provide some counterbalance, suggesting the process isn't completely stalled.

## Outside View Prediction:
37%

Forecaster_3 step 1 output:
Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. Axios (Jan. 30, 2025): Highly reputable. Reports Howard Lutnick, Biden’s Commerce nominee, explicitly rejected the Project 2025 proposal to break up NOAA at his Senate hearing. Factual testimony quoted; little to no opinion. Implication: the administration’s top Commerce official is on record opposing this objective, making formal action unlikely without his cooperation.  
   b. ABC News (Feb. 5, 2025): Reliable mainstream outlet. Describes DOGE’s limited access to NOAA IT systems to review DEI materials but notes that any effort to dismantle NOAA without Congress would be unlawful. Reports are factual, though some quotes (“ransacking,” “wreaking havoc”) are partisan statements from Democratic members of Congress. No evidence of an EO or directive to break up NOAA.  
   c. The Fulcrum (Oct. 30, 2024): Specialized policy website. Summarizes Project 2025’s blueprint for “breaking up NOAA,” including separating NWS and commercializing forecasts. Contains expert opinions (Emanuel, Cleetus, Masters) warning of catastrophic outcomes. Factual outline of the proposal, credible expert commentary. But as of late 2024, no implementation steps had been taken.  
   d. Perplexity report (project2025.observer tracker): Community-driven tracker data. Provides a history of 297 objectives, 36%–42% completed by April/May 2025, with an average 45–60 days to move from “in progress” to “complete.” Tracker’s methodology is transparent, but it’s maintained by volunteers on Reddit, so it’s moderately reliable for broad completion rates but less authoritative for legal or executive-branch nuance.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
   • Broad tracker objectives: ~40% completion rate 3–4 months into Trump’s second term, averaging 8–13 completions per month.  
   • Major federal‐agency reorganizations: Historically rare, require congressional or presidential reorganization plans plus potential legislation, often take years, and face judicial review.  
   • Complex/high-visibility objectives (e.g., DOJ politicization, FEMA overhaul): Those have generally stalled or proceeded slowly compared to lower-hanging regulatory rollbacks.  

   The most suitable reference class is “complex, contested reorganization objectives in the Project 2025 tracker,” whose historical completion rate is well below the tracker average—on the order of 5–15% within a comparable timeframe.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Time left: ~1.5 months until the July 1, 2025 cutoff.  
   • Historical pace: At best, 5–8 objectives marked “complete” per month, overwhelmingly regulatory or executive-order‐driven items, not wholesale agency dismantling.  
   • Organizational politics: Commerce Secretary nomination still pending as of May 15; nominee opposes the breakup; any executive order would likely trigger immediate legal challenges and require days to be processed and then tracked.  

4. Justification for outside view  
   • The Axios report makes clear the administration’s likely Commerce leadership is against NOAA’s breakup.  
   • ABC News underscores that unauthorized dismantling would be unlawful and that agency staff are pushing back.  
   • Fulcrum’s warnings have not translated into any indicated steps toward completion by mid-May; the objective remains “in progress.”  
   • The Project 2025 tracker’s own data show that even straightforward objectives take 45–60 days to complete, and complex ones take longer or never finish.  
   • With only 45 days remaining, and no signs of a forthcoming executive order or legislative action, marking the objective “complete” appears low‐probability.  

Outside view calibration:

• Baseline average completion by July for all objectives: ~46%.  
• Adjust down for complexity, legal hurdles, and executive resistance: factor ≈0.2.  
• Adjust further for the compressed 1.5-month window: factor ≈0.7.  

Combined calibration: 46% × 0.2 × 0.7 ≈ 6.4%. Given uncertainty, a rounded outside‐view estimate is ~7%.

Outside View Prediction:
7% chance that the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet will mark “break up NOAA” as complete before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   • Democracy Forward guide (“The People’s Guide to Project 2025”)  
     – Deep-dive overview of Project 2025’s 900-page playbook and its agency-by-agency proposals. High credibility on the document’s content but advocacy-focused. Factual about the proposal to break up NOAA; opinionated about impacts.  
   • Human Rights First post (Andrew Beale)  
     – Similar authoritative breakdown of Project 2025. Confirms the blueprint includes dismantling federal agencies such as NOAA. Good track record, factual on the agency-by-agency structure; opinion on authoritarian risks should be weighted cautiously.  
   • ACLU memo series (“Project 2025, Explained”)  
     – Also confirms the recommendation to reorganize or abolish parts of NOAA. Factual on stated proposals; advocacy-oriented in tone.  
   • Axios (Jan 30, 2025)  
     – Reports Commerce-secretary nominee Howard Lutnick’s explicit rejection of the NOAA break-up plan at his confirmation hearing. Straight news, well‐sourced, high reliability.  
   • ABC News (Feb 5, 2025)  
     – Documents Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessing NOAA systems, reviewing DEI materials, and notes committee investigations warning against dismantling NOAA without Congress. Solid reporting, factual on DOGE actions; quotes politicized but sourced.  
   • The Fulcrum (Oct 30, 2024)  
     – Details Project 2025’s NOAA break-up proposal, expert warnings about hurricane warnings degradation. Good on expert opinion; factual on the proposal’s content.  
   • Perplexity report on the r/Keep_Track Project 2025 Tracker  
     – Reports 297 objectives total, 107 “complete,” 45 “in progress,” average completion lag of 45–60 days, and that the NOAA objective remains “in progress.” Community-sourced data; plausible but less formally audited.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
   Potential reference classes:  
   • All Project 2025 Tracker objectives and their historic completion rates.  
   • Structural reorganization objectives (e.g., breaking up an agency) within the Tracker.  
   • Agency-restructuring efforts across administrations (e.g., DHS creation in 2002).  

   Suitability: The Tracker itself offers the best base rate, since it directly measures analogous objectives. Within the Tracker, 36% of all objectives have been completed, and roughly 15% are in progress. Of those in progress, average completion time is 45–60 days.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Present date: May 15, 2025. Resolution date: July 1, 2025 (47 days away).  
   • Historical timing: average “in progress” objective takes 45–60 days from “in progress” to “complete.”  
   • The NOAA objective was flagged “in progress” by late February/early March (ABC News, Feb 5) – over 100 days ago. It has already exceeded the typical completion window without resolution.

4. Justification for outside-view probability  
   • Base-rate: 36% of all objectives complete eventually; of the 45 in progress as of early May, ~16 (36%) might be expected to finish in a standard cycle. That suggests ~36% conditional probability for in-progress items, absent other factors.  
   • Timing: Only 47 days remain – near the lower bound of the 45–60 day average. Many in-progress items will therefore miss the cutoff.  
   • Difficulty: Breaking up a major agency like NOAA requires a high-level executive order, widespread interagency coordination, likely legal challenges, and in this case explicit opposition from the incoming Commerce secretary nominee. That makes it one of the Tracker’s hardest objectives.  
   • News signal: Since Lutnick’s confirmation hearing (Jan 30) no further steps have been reported to implement the break-up. DOGE’s IT review and spokesperson clarifications suggest more oversight than wholesale breakup.  
   • Tracker behavior: Community updates depend on verifiable public actions. Absent a surprise executive order or leaked document, no “complete” tag would be applied.

Outside view calibration:

Start from the Tracker’s 36% in-progress completion rate, reduce to account for (a) the objective’s high complexity and (b) the tight remaining timeframe. 36% → 25% for time constraint → 15% for difficulty and negative news flow.

Outside View Prediction:

15%

This reflects the probability that the “break up NOAA” objective on the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet will be marked complete by July 1, 2025.

   • Opinions: “extremists,” “would reverse decades,” projected job losses.  
   • Quality: solid on document provenance; highly partisan on consequences. Use factual details, down-weight evaluative language.

2. Human Rights First guest post (May 2025).  
   • Facts: number of state/federal bills logged in Democracy Watch Tracker, quotations from Project 2025 text.  
   • Opinions: “authoritarian,” “rollback nearly a century.”  
   • Quality: cites bill counts and page references; again partisan. Use counts; discount rhetoric.

3. ACLU explainer (2024 excerpt).  
   • Facts: Project 2025 produced by Heritage + former Trump officials; example policy areas.  
   • Opinions: “extreme,” “unconstitutional.”  
   • Quality: credible about authors / chapter authors; advocacy tone—treat judgments cautiously.

4. Axios (30 Jan 2025) confirmation-hearing article.  
   • Facts: Howard Lutnick (Commerce nominee) publicly rejected breaking up NOAA; still unconfirmed.  
   • No obvious partisan coloring.  
   • Quality: High—straight news with verbatim quotes and date-stamped hearing.

5. ABC News (late Feb 2025).  
   • Facts: DOGE staff now have NOAA IT access; brief web outages; House committee investigating legality.  
   • Opinions from Reps. Huffman/Lofgren and unnamed ex-NOAA staff.  
   • Quality: Main factual nuggets are verifiable; opinions flagged as quotes.

6. The Fulcrum (Oct 2024).  
   • Facts: excerpts from Project 2025 chapter calling to “break up NOAA”; expert quotes (Emanuel, Cleetus, Masters) on forecast risks.  
   • Quality: Hybrid explanatory / analysis piece; the direct quote of plan language is factual; expert warnings are opinion but come from subject-matter authorities—weight modestly.

7. Perplexity report on Project 2025 Tracker (May 2025).  
   • Facts: Tracker created by r/Keep_Track mods; 297 objectives; status categories; headline stats (42 % complete by Apr 2025, 5-8 items/month lately). Claims “break up NOAA” is still “in progress.”  
   • Caveats: secondary compilation; numbers broadly plausible but not independently confirmed. Treat as indicative not definitive.

B. Reference class analysis  
Candidates  
1. “Major federal agency structural changes accomplished solely via executive action within first six months of a new administration.”  – Historically extremely rare (e.g., DHS creation 2002 required statute; Office of Science & Technology relocation attempts stalled).  
2. “Policy objectives listed by third-party trackers that move from ‘in progress’ to ‘complete’ inside a 60-day window.” – Tracker-specific base rate roughly 45–60 days median (Perplexity).  
3. “All objectives on Project 2025 Tracker” – 42 % completion in ~120 days overall; but distribution is heavy-tailed—easy rollbacks dominate.

Suitability: #1 matches type of action (break-up of a cabinet-level agency) but sample size tiny. #2 matches measurement definition (“status flips”) and timing window we care about. Combine: start with tracker-level completion base rate (42 % so far), then discount heavily for high-complexity items.  

C. Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 15 May 2025. Resolution deadline: 1 July 2025 ⇒ 46 days.  
• Tracker historical pattern: 5–8 completions/month recently. Even if 8 more flip by July 1, only a small share will be large-scale restructurings.  
• “Break up NOAA” has been “in progress” at least three months; median transition time 45–60 days, so timing does not rule it out but complexity does.

D. Justification for outside-view probability  
Base rate 42 % of objectives eventually completed in first four months. But:  
• Complexity/visibility: Breaking up NOAA is among most elaborate items, likely in slowest decile. If we assume a Pareto-like distribution and assign only 10 % of completions to “major structural reorganizations,” base rate for this class ≈ 0.42 × 0.10 ≈ 4 %.  
• Tracker leniency: mods sometimes mark “complete” based on executive orders even if litigation unresolved. That could raise odds; double to 8 %.  
• 46-day window: only ~20 % of all completions to date have occurred in any given 45-day span (5–8 out of 124). Apply this temporal filter: 8 % × 0.2 ≈ 1.6 %.  
• Round upward modestly (chance of sudden Friday-night EO, tracker subjectivity).  

Outside view calibration:

Anchor base probability at roughly 2 % that the tracker will mark the NOAA break-up objective “complete” in the next 46 days, given historic completion frequency, item complexity, and compressed window. Recognize ±1 ppt error band from limited sample size.  

Outside View Prediction:
2 %

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Project 2025 Blueprint Specificity** - The EDGI summary shows detailed plans for breaking up NOAA, with specific recommendations for each component. This confirms breaking up NOAA is a priority objective with clear implementation steps.

2. **Commerce Secretary Opposition** - Howard Lutnick explicitly stated during his confirmation hearing that he "does not support dismantling NOAA or NWS" (ABC News). As the cabinet official responsible for NOAA, his opposition represents a significant institutional barrier.

3. **Hurricane Season Timing** - Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1, creating substantial institutional resistance to disrupting weather forecasting services during a critical public safety period. Multiple sources highlight NOAA's life-saving hurricane forecasting role.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Early Implementation Signs** - February 2025 reporting indicates that NOAA employees have received guidance to avoid certain terms, and the administration has made specific nominations for NOAA leadership, suggesting preliminary implementation steps.

2. **Complex Agency Structure** - NOAA's six main offices manage critical nationwide services including weather forecasting, hurricane tracking, and fisheries management, requiring complex coordination for any reorganization.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Public Opposition** - Multiple sources indicate concern about privatizing weather services, which could create political pressure against rapid implementation, but this factor alone rarely prevents determined administrative action.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

We have 45 days from today (May 15, 2025) until the resolution date (July 1, 2025). This is a very short timeframe for completing a major agency reorganization given:

1. The complexity of NOAA's operations across multiple critical functions
2. The need for legal reviews and potential regulatory changes
3. Budget reallocations and personnel transfers
4. The coincidence with hurricane season beginning June 1

If the timeframe were halved (23 days), the probability would decrease significantly to <10%, as even administrative marking of completion would be implausible.

If the timeframe were doubled (90 days), the probability would increase moderately to perhaps 35-40%, allowing more time for initial implementation steps that could justify marking the objective as "complete" on the tracker.

## (d) Justification:

The key factors weighing against completion by July 1:

1. **Commerce Secretary Opposition** - Howard Lutnick's explicit rejection of dismantling NOAA creates significant bureaucratic resistance from the cabinet officer directly responsible.

2. **Hurricane Season Coincidence** - Beginning June 1, any disruption to NOAA's forecasting capabilities during hurricane season presents substantial political and public safety risks.

3. **Implementation Complexity** - Breaking up an agency with NOAA's scope (159 weather radars, 620 facilities nationwide, $6.5B budget) requires extensive planning, legal review, and coordination that typically takes many months.

4. **Limited Progress Evidence** - While early steps are underway (term guidance, nominations), sources only indicate preliminary actions rather than substantial restructuring progress as of February 2025.

Factors supporting possible completion:

1. **Administrative vs. Practical Completion** - The tracking spreadsheet might mark an objective as "complete" based on initial executive orders or reorganization announcements, even if full implementation takes longer.

2. **Project Priority** - The detailed specificity in Project 2025 suggests breaking up NOAA is a high-priority objective.

Weighing these factors, the strong institutional barriers (Commerce Secretary opposition, hurricane season timing) and implementation complexity make completion within the next 45 days unlikely, though not impossible.

## Probability calibration:

Starting with baseline expectations for complex agency reorganizations (typically 6-12+ months), adjusted for:
- The specific question asking about marking "complete" in a tracking spreadsheet rather than actual full implementation
- Commerce Secretary's explicit opposition
- Hurricane season timing (starting June 1)
- Limited progress evidence from available sources
- Short timeframe (45 days)

I estimate approximately 20% probability that the Project 2025 Tracker will mark breaking up NOAA as "complete" before July 1, 2025.

## Checklist:
1. Will Project 2025's tracker spreadsheet mark "break up NOAA" objective as complete (not just in progress) before July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: Complex agency reorganizations typically take 6-12+ months; administrative designation could be faster but requires sufficient implementation steps.
3. 20 out of 100 times, Project 2025's tracker will mark "break up NOAA" as complete before July 1, 2025.
4. Key evidence: Commerce Secretary explicitly opposes dismantling NOAA; Hurricane season begins June 1 creating operational risks; Reorganizing agency with 620 facilities requires extensive coordination; Only early implementation signs visible in February reporting.
5. Blind spot: The administration could mark objective complete based on executive orders/announced plans rather than substantive implementation.
6. Status quo favors continued "in progress" status given implementation complexity and hurricane season timing.

Probability: 20%
Predicted Probability: 20.0%

6. **News-Press Opinion** (July 2024)
   - Older opinion piece from political strategist
   - Provides context on Project 2025 intentions but predates implementation

## Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- Commerce Secretary Lutnick's explicit statement opposing NOAA dismantling (ABC News) - As the Cabinet official overseeing NOAA, his position substantially decreases likelihood of implementation
- Complex nature of NOAA's structure (EDGI) - Breaking up six major operational lines with 12,000+ employees across 620 facilities would require extensive administrative and possibly legislative action

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Implementation timeline context (Outside view) - Average 45-60 days to move objectives from "in progress" to "complete" in tracker
- Reported preparatory actions (ABC News) - Unnamed sources claim 1,000+ planned layoffs and facility lease terminations
- Neil Jacobs nomination (NPR) - Previous NOAA leader nominated again, suggesting potential continuity

**Weak Evidence:**
- General Project 2025 implementation rate (40% of objectives)
- Advocacy pieces warning about potential consequences

## Timeframe Analysis:
With only 46 days until July 1st, the timeframe is extremely constraining for such a complex reorganization:

- If timeframe were halved (23 days): Probability would decrease by 60-70% as implementation would be virtually impossible
- If timeframe were doubled (92 days): Probability would increase by perhaps 20-30%, but fundamental constraints would remain

Complex federal reorganizations typically require months or years of planning, potential legislative action, and navigation of legal challenges. Even with executive orders, actual implementation sufficient to mark as "complete" within 46 days is highly unlikely.

## Justification:
The outside view base rate of 7% requires significant downward adjustment based on:

1. **Commerce Secretary Opposition**: The Cabinet secretary directly responsible for NOAA has explicitly stated opposition to dismantling the agency, creating a substantial roadblock to implementation.

2. **Implementation Complexity**: Breaking up NOAA involves six major offices, multiple functions distributed across 620 facilities, and potential legislative requirements. This complexity makes rapid implementation extremely challenging.

3. **Timeframe Constraints**: With only 46 days remaining until resolution date, and complex reorganizations typically exceeding the 45-60 day average for objective completion, the window is exceptionally tight.

4. **Partial Implementation Confusion**: The Project 2025 tracker's methodology for marking objectives "complete" is unclear - would partial implementation count? The objective specifically calls for breaking up NOAA, not merely downsizing it.

While some preparatory actions may be underway (reported layoffs, lease terminations), these fall far short of a complete breakup and may represent standard budget adjustments or targeted downsizing rather than implementation of the full Project 2025 recommendation.

## Probability calibration
Starting from the outside view estimate of 7%:

- **Commerce Secretary Opposition** (-4 percentage points): The explicit statement from Lutnick substantially decreases likelihood, as any breakup would likely require his department's cooperation.
- **Implementation Complexity** (-1.5 percentage points): Breaking up a major agency with multiple offices and functions is significantly more complex than average objectives.
- **Timeframe Constraints** (-1 percentage point): Only 46 days remain, below even the average completion timeframe for simpler objectives.
- **Reported Preparatory Actions** (+0.5 percentage points): Some downsizing may be underway, which could represent initial steps.

Calibrated inside view prediction: 1%

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Project 2025 Tracker mark "break up NOAA" complete in their spreadsheet before July 1, 2025 (46 days)?
2. Outside view: 7% base rate for complex reorganization objectives
3. Consistency: 1 out of 100 similar situations would see complex agency dismantling tracked as complete within this timeframe
4. Key evidence: Commerce Secretary opposes dismantling; complex reorganization typically slow; only 46 days remain; some downsizing may be underway
5. Blind spot: Executive order declaring reorganization intent could be incorrectly marked "complete" by tracker without actual implementation
6. Status quo: Strong pull toward status quo given complexity and timeframe

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of the question & resolution criteria  
   “Will the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet mark its ‘Break Up NOAA’ objective as complete by July 1, 2025?” The tracker must show “complete” (not “in progress”) on or before that date.  

2. Source analysis  
   • Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet (via Perplexity report, May 2025)  
     – Status: “Break Up NOAA” is marked “in progress.”  
     – Quality: High (directly tracks completion status).  

   • Axios, Jan 30 2025 (“Commerce nominee rejects NOAA breakup”)  
     – Reports Commerce Secretary‐designate Howard Lutnick disavowed the break-up plan under questioning.  
     – Quality: High (reliable politico reporting; based on public hearing transcripts).  

   • NPR, Feb 15 2025 (“Trump officials signal potential changes at NOAA”)  
     – NOAA staff “on high alert,” Project 2025 blueprint calls for breakup, but senior Commerce nominee punts specifics pending further review.  
     – Quality: High (detailed reporting; multiple on-the-record and anonymous sources).  

   • ABC News, early 2025 (“Privatize National Weather Service?”)  
     – Details Project 2025’s language on breaking up NOAA, quotes Lutnick saying he does not support dismantling NOAA/NWS.  
     – Quality: High (named sources, direct quotes).  

   • EDGI annotated Project 2025 excerpt (Heritage Foundation’s plan for NOAA)  
     – Lays out 14 sub-recommendations for breaking up/downsizing NOAA functions.  
     – Quality: Medium (authoritative in describing Project 2025 content but partisan annotation).  

   • Union of Concerned Scientists blog (Feb 12 2025)  
     – Expert viewpoint on critical public-safety functions at risk if NOAA is dismantled.  
     – Quality: Medium (named experts, but normative rather than status updates).  

   • News-Press opinion (Aug 2024)  
     – Regional op-ed warning of economic/climate risks in Florida if NOAA cuts occur.  
     – Quality: Low-Medium (opinion, less directly tied to current implementation).  

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence (large shifts)  
   – Lutnick’s explicit rejection of breakup in multiple hearings (Axios, ABC, NPR). Demonstrates top‐level executive resistance.  
   – Tracker status: objective still “in progress” as of mid-May, with no sign of marking “complete.”  

   Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)  
   – Historical average completion time for “in progress” Tracker objectives: ~45–60 days. Our window to July 1 is ~45 days.  
   – Signed executive actions on NOAA climate initiatives executed in ~21 days (but smaller in scope).  

   Weak evidence (small shifts)  
   – Implementation steps (layoffs, regional closures, IT audit) underway suggest administrative momentum.  
   – Vocal legal challenges from environmental groups may slow final administrative sign-off.  

4. Reference-class / outside view base rate  
   • Among Project 2025 objectives marked “in progress” as of mid-May, ~50% historically complete within 45 days.  

5. Timeframe analysis  
   • Forecast window: 47 days (May 15–July 1).  
   • If window halved (~23 days), probability would drop precipitously (<15%) because average completion time is ≥45 days.  
   • If window doubled (~94 days), probability would rise substantially (>60%), giving more buffer for Senate and legal delays.  

6. Inside-view justification & adjustments  
   Base rate: 50% (average for “in progress” objectives).  
   Downward adjustments (−25 points total):  
     a. Complexity & scope: Breaking up a large agency is far more complex than typical Project 2025 objectives (−10%).  
     b. Executive resistance: Commerce Secretary and other senior appointees publicly oppose this specific reform (−8%).  
     c. Senate/legal delays: Confirmation hearings cited as blockers; environmental groups preparing suits (−7%).  
   Upward adjustments (+5 points):  
     a. Implementation steps already underway show genuine administrative effort (+3%).  
     b. Narrow window: Admin may rush to mark small deliverables as “complete” before July 1 to show progress (+2%).  

   Adjusted probability = 50% − 25% + 5% = 30%.  

Probability calibration  
I assign a 30% probability that the “Break Up NOAA” objective will be marked “complete” by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase & criteria in 30 words: ✓  
2. Base-rate (50% for similar in-progress objectives) noted: ✓  
3. Consistency check: “30 out of 100 times, this objective is marked complete by deadline.” ✓  
4. Top evidence (<20 words each):  
   • Lutnick’s repeated public rejection of NOAA breakup (Strong).  
   • Tracker still “in progress” as of May 2025 (Strong).  
   • Average completion time 45–60 days vs. 47-day window (Moderate).  
   • Complexity of agency reorganization (Moderate).  
   • Implementation steps underway (Weak).  
5. Blind-spot: Admin quietly redefines “complete” with symbolic action; might overstate progress.  
6. Status quo: Most likely nothing changes and objective remains “in progress.”

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question and resolution criteria  
The question asks: “By July 1, 2025, will the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet mark the ‘Break Up NOAA’ objective as complete?” It resolves “Yes” only if that objective’s status on the public Tracker is exactly “complete” on or before July 1.  

2. Source analysis  
• EDGI-annotated excerpt (Scout Blum & C. Sellers, envirodatagov.org, date unknown but based on Project 2025’s Chapter 21)  
  – Quality: Direct excerpt from Project 2025, annotated by environmental historians. Highly reliable on content of the blueprint (the break-up proposals), opinion-laden on impacts. Dated mid-2024.  
• NPR article (Feb 15 2025)  
  – Quality: Established news outlet, multiple on-the-record quotes. Reports that Trump officials and senior nominees have signaled interest in NOAA reorganization but have not yet issued a break-up order. Reliable, current.  
• Wikipedia summary of Project 2025 (date retrieved early 2025)  
  – Quality: Summarizes Project 2025 objectives including dismantling NOAA. Good for baseline, but secondary.  
• UCS blog (Feb 12 2025)  
  – Quality: Advocacy source pointing out risks of NOAA dismantling. Reliable on NOAA’s current performance; opinion-driven on risks.  
• ABC News (Feb 5 2025)  
  – Quality: Well-sourced reporting on internal reviews, proposed NOAA cuts, and Commerce Secretary nominee’s stance. Reliable; documents lack of concrete break-up actions.  
• R/Keep_Track Project 2025 Tracker status (Perplexity report, early May 2025)  
  – Quality: Community-sourced spreadsheet data. Less formally audited but likely accurate on “in progress” vs. “complete” tags.  

3. Reference-class and outside-view base rate  
• On the Tracker, of ~297 objectives, 107 (36%) are “complete” overall; among 45 “in progress” as of early May, historically ~36% eventually complete.  
• Average in-progress objective takes 45–60 days to go from “in progress” to “complete.”  

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
  a. Multiple independent sources (EDGI, Wikipedia, NPR, ABC) confirm Project 2025 blueprint explicitly calls for breaking up NOAA. (Confirms the objective’s existence; no shift in probability.)  
  b. Axios report (Jan 30 2025) and ABC News quotes of Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick rejecting dismantling NOAA at confirmation hearings. Strong, on-the-record opposition. (Lowers probability.)  
  c. No executive order, draft legislation, or verifiable public action to break up NOAA has been reported in >100 days since the plan was public. (Lowers probability.)  

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
  d. Tracker community’s average in-progress completion time (45–60 days) vs. only 47 days remaining until resolution. (Lowers probability moderately.)  
  e. Institutional complexity: breaking up a large federal agency requires high-level legal, budgetary, and interagency actions plus likely Congressional pushback. (Lowers probability.)  

Weak evidence (small shifts):  
  f. Fear and demoralization among NOAA staff (NPR, ABC) may speed small cosmetic reorganizations but not a full break-up. (Negligible shift.)  
  g. Project 2025 momentum: early admin actions have mirrored other blueprint elements, implying some traction—but none on NOAA break-up yet. (Small uptick for possibility, but weak.)  

5. Timeframe analysis  
• Today: May 15, 2025. Resolution: July 1, 2025. Δ = 47 days.  
• Halved timeframe (23 days): far below average completion time → probability would drop further (e.g. from ~15% to ~8%).  
• Doubled timeframe (94 days): more time could allow laggards to finish → probability might rise modestly toward the 36% base rate, say to ~25%.  

6. Justification & probability shifts  
Start with outside-view base rate of 36% for in-progress objectives.  
• Time constraint (47 days vs. 45–60 days average) → reduce to ~25%.  
• High complexity/legal hurdles + explicit denial by Commerce Secretary nominee → further reduce to ~15%.  
• Lack of any public action over 100 days → no upward adjustment.  

Thus my inside-view forecast is 15%.  

Probability calibration  
Given the strong institutional barriers, explicit leadership opposition, and tight timeline, a probability substantially below the 36% base rate is warranted. A 15% forecast captures a low but non-zero chance of a last-minute order or surprise legal mechanism slipping through. A ±10% shift would represent a major new development (e.g., a leaked executive order draft or a sudden leadership reversal).  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Question concerns marking “Break Up NOAA” complete on Tracker by July 1, 2025. ✔  
2. Base rate: 36% for in-progress objectives. ✔  
3. Consistency check: “15 times out of 100, the Tracker will mark NOAA break-up complete by July 1.” ✔  
4. Top evidence (20 words max each):  
   • Nominee Lutnick’s on-record rejection of NOAA break-up (Axios, ABC).  
   • No executive orders or public actions in >100 days despite heavy monitoring (NPR, ABC).  
   • Average completion 45–60 days vs. 47 days left.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden classified executive action or legal redefinition could slip the objective to “complete” without public notice, raising odds.  
6. Status quo: Most Tracker items change slowly. Given no signs of rapid movement, default to status quo (“in progress”) and low completion odds.

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• EDGI annotated chapter (Aug 2024): primary‐source excerpts from Project 2025 plus scholarly annotation; high factual value on what the blueprint proposes, low predictive value on timing.  
• NPR (15 Feb 2025): straight news, quoting NOAA staff, Commerce-nominee Howard Lutnick, and outside experts; reliable; gives most recent public statements from administration.  
• Wikipedia Project 2025 (last updated early 2025): tertiary compilation, good for broad context, lower authority.  
• UCS blog (12 Feb 2025) and News-Press op-ed (Aug 2024): advocacy pieces; facts about NOAA’s current activities are solid, forward-looking opinions discounted.  
• ABC News (Mar 2025): investigative news with named meteorologists, Commerce-secretary quotes, and unnamed government sources; high factual quality on layoffs and policy direction.  
• Perplexity/Tracker write-up (6 May 2025): secondary report on the Google sheet we care about; confirms the row is still “In progress”. Moderate reliability (publicly visible sheet can be checked).  
Across all sources, only the NPR and ABC articles give near-term, inside-government signals; both report turbulence but no completed break-up order.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (downward pressure)  
– U.S. law and historical precedent: dismantling or transferring a sub-cabinet agency the size of NOAA normally requires legislation; no such bill has moved.  
– Howard Lutnick (Commerce nominee) on record in Senate hearing (30 Jan 2025) saying he does not support dismantling NOAA.  
Moderate evidence (mixed)  
– Multiple news outlets (NPR, ABC) confirm staff are preparing for cuts and partial reorganisation, indicating some momentum.  
– Tracker maintainers often mark items “complete” on the basis of signed executive orders, even if follow-through is uncertain (Perplexity analysis).  
Weak evidence (minor upward)  
– Anonymous claims of 1,000 layoffs and curtailed balloon launches could foreshadow a headline executive order.  
– Heritage/Project 2025 language continues to be cited by sympathetic political appointees.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
46 days remain (15 May → 1 Jul 2025).  Historical sheet activity: 5-8 completions per month, the vast majority simple roll-backs or regulatory suspensions.  If the window were doubled to 92 days I would raise the probability roughly ×1.5 (to ~5 %), mainly because a midsummer reorg could accompany the FY 2026 budget.  If halved to 23 days I would cut the probability by roughly half (to ~1.5 %).  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate for a big-ticket structural item moving from “In progress” to “Complete” in any given 45-day window was set at 2 %.  
Negative adjustments  
• Structural/legal obstacles (strong) –0.7 pp  
• Commerce Secretary’s explicit rejection (moderate) –0.3 pp  
Positive adjustments  
• Evidence of internal downsizing plans (moderate) +0.5 pp  
• Tracker’s lenient completion criteria (moderate) +0.8 pp  
Net shift: +0.3 pp → 2.3 %, rounded to 3 % for ease of communication and to acknowledge residual tail risks (Friday-evening executive order, tracker subjectivity).  

Probability calibration
I expect that roughly 3 times in 100 parallel worlds the Google sheet will show the NOAA break-up row as “Complete” when Metaculus checks on or after 1 July 2025.  Uncertainty: ±2 pp (90 % CI 1–5 %).  A ±10 % absolute shift would be unjustified given the paucity of concrete action signs and the short window.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase – “Before 1 Jul 2025, will the Project 2025 Tracker mark ‘break up NOAA’ row as complete?”  
2. Outside base = 2 %.  Final forecast builds directly from it.  
3. Consistency – “3 out of 100 times, the sheet says ‘Complete’ by the deadline.” ✔  
4. Key evidence: (i) no enabling legislation, (ii) Commerce Sec opposes, (iii) layoffs planning shows partial momentum, (iv) tracker leniency, (v) 46-day window.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden omnibus executive order reassigning NOAA offices and tracker mods instantly marking “Complete.”  Would raise probability into low-teens.  
6. Status quo bias: inertia favours “In progress” remaining; short window reinforces that outcome.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Project 2025 Blueprint Specificity** - The EDGI summary shows detailed plans for breaking up NOAA, with specific recommendations for each component. This confirms breaking up NOAA is a priority objective with clear implementation steps.

2. **Commerce Secretary Opposition** - Howard Lutnick explicitly stated during his confirmation hearing that he "does not support dismantling NOAA or NWS" (ABC News). As the cabinet official responsible for NOAA, his opposition represents a significant institutional barrier.

3. **Hurricane Season Timing** - Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1, creating substantial institutional resistance to disrupting weather forecasting services during a critical public safety period. Multiple sources highlight NOAA's life-saving hurricane forecasting role.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Early Implementation Signs** - February 2025 reporting indicates that NOAA employees have received guidance to avoid certain terms, and the administration has made specific nominations for NOAA leadership, suggesting preliminary implementation steps.

2. **Complex Agency Structure** - NOAA's six main offices manage critical nationwide services including weather forecasting, hurricane tracking, and fisheries management, requiring complex coordination for any reorganization.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Public Opposition** - Multiple sources indicate concern about privatizing weather services, which could create political pressure against rapid implementation, but this factor alone rarely prevents determined administrative action.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

We have 45 days from today (May 15, 2025) until the resolution date (July 1, 2025). This is a very short timeframe for completing a major agency reorganization given:

1. The complexity of NOAA's operations across multiple critical functions
2. The need for legal reviews and potential regulatory changes
3. Budget reallocations and personnel transfers
4. The coincidence with hurricane season beginning June 1

If the timeframe were halved (23 days), the probability would decrease significantly to <10%, as even administrative marking of completion would be implausible.

If the timeframe were doubled (90 days), the probability would increase moderately to perhaps 35-40%, allowing more time for initial implementation steps that could justify marking the objective as "complete" on the tracker.

## (d) Justification:

The key factors weighing against completion by July 1:

1. **Commerce Secretary Opposition** - Howard Lutnick's explicit rejection of dismantling NOAA creates significant bureaucratic resistance from the cabinet officer directly responsible.

2. **Hurricane Season Coincidence** - Beginning June 1, any disruption to NOAA's forecasting capabilities during hurricane season presents substantial political and public safety risks.

3. **Implementation Complexity** - Breaking up an agency with NOAA's scope (159 weather radars, 620 facilities nationwide, $6.5B budget) requires extensive planning, legal review, and coordination that typically takes many months.

4. **Limited Progress Evidence** - While early steps are underway (term guidance, nominations), sources only indicate preliminary actions rather than substantial restructuring progress as of February 2025.

Factors supporting possible completion:

1. **Administrative vs. Practical Completion** - The tracking spreadsheet might mark an objective as "complete" based on initial executive orders or reorganization announcements, even if full implementation takes longer.

2. **Project Priority** - The detailed specificity in Project 2025 suggests breaking up NOAA is a high-priority objective.

Weighing these factors, the strong institutional barriers (Commerce Secretary opposition, hurricane season timing) and implementation complexity make completion within the next 45 days unlikely, though not impossible.

## Probability calibration:

Starting with baseline expectations for complex agency reorganizations (typically 6-12+ months), adjusted for:
- The specific question asking about marking "complete" in a tracking spreadsheet rather than actual full implementation
- Commerce Secretary's explicit opposition
- Hurricane season timing (starting June 1)
- Limited progress evidence from available sources
- Short timeframe (45 days)

I estimate approximately 20% probability that the Project 2025 Tracker will mark breaking up NOAA as "complete" before July 1, 2025.

## Checklist:
1. Will Project 2025's tracker spreadsheet mark "break up NOAA" objective as complete (not just in progress) before July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: Complex agency reorganizations typically take 6-12+ months; administrative designation could be faster but requires sufficient implementation steps.
3. 20 out of 100 times, Project 2025's tracker will mark "break up NOAA" as complete before July 1, 2025.
4. Key evidence: Commerce Secretary explicitly opposes dismantling NOAA; Hurricane season begins June 1 creating operational risks; Reorganizing agency with 620 facilities requires extensive coordination; Only early implementation signs visible in February reporting.
5. Blind spot: The administration could mark objective complete based on executive orders/announced plans rather than substantive implementation.
6. Status quo favors continued "in progress" status given implementation complexity and hurricane season timing.

Probability: 20%
Predicted Probability: 20.0%

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:
1. **EDGI Annotation on "Break Up NOAA"** (no specific date)
   - Detailed breakdown of Project 2025's recommendations for dismantling NOAA
   - Reputable research organization; provides factual analysis of the proposal's components
   - No indication of implementation status

2. **NPR Article** (February 15, 2025)
   - Credible news source reporting NOAA employees "on high alert" for reorganization
   - Notes Neil Jacobs nominated to lead NOAA again (former acting head)
   - Commerce Secretary Lutnick stated during confirmation it was "premature to discuss specific recommendations"
   - Expert testimony from former NOAA officials (Andy Rosenberg, Craig McLean)

3. **Wikipedia - Project 2025** (current as of May 2025)
   - General overview of Project 2025 heritage and implementation
   - Notes that nearly two-thirds of Trump's early second-term actions mirror Project 2025 proposals (Time magazine)
   - No specific NOAA implementation details

4. **UCS Blog** (February 12, 2025)
   - Advocacy piece warning about consequences of dismantling NOAA
   - Includes relevant statistics on NOAA's impact and expertise (Dr. Astrid Caldas)
   - Focuses on potential impacts rather than implementation status

5. **ABC News** (early 2025)
   - Reports Commerce Secretary Lutnick explicitly stated he does not support dismantling NOAA or NWS
   - Quotes meteorology experts on NOAA's importance (Jan Null, Ginger Zee)
   - Unnamed sources claim preparations for 1,000+ NOAA layoffs and lease terminations

6. **News-Press Opinion** (July 2024)
   - Older opinion piece from political strategist
   - Provides context on Project 2025 intentions but predates implementation

## Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- Commerce Secretary Lutnick's explicit statement opposing NOAA dismantling (ABC News) - As the Cabinet official overseeing NOAA, his position substantially decreases likelihood of implementation
- Complex nature of NOAA's structure (EDGI) - Breaking up six major operational lines with 12,000+ employees across 620 facilities would require extensive administrative and possibly legislative action

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Implementation timeline context (Outside view) - Average 45-60 days to move objectives from "in progress" to "complete" in tracker
- Reported preparatory actions (ABC News) - Unnamed sources claim 1,000+ planned layoffs and facility lease terminations
- Neil Jacobs nomination (NPR) - Previous NOAA leader nominated again, suggesting potential continuity

**Weak Evidence:**
- General Project 2025 implementation rate (40% of objectives)
- Advocacy pieces warning about potential consequences

## Timeframe Analysis:
With only 46 days until July 1st, the timeframe is extremely constraining for such a complex reorganization:

- If timeframe were halved (23 days): Probability would decrease by 60-70% as implementation would be virtually impossible
- If timeframe were doubled (92 days): Probability would increase by perhaps 20-30%, but fundamental constraints would remain

Complex federal reorganizations typically require months or years of planning, potential legislative action, and navigation of legal challenges. Even with executive orders, actual implementation sufficient to mark as "complete" within 46 days is highly unlikely.

## Justification:
The outside view base rate of 7% requires significant downward adjustment based on:

1. **Commerce Secretary Opposition**: The Cabinet secretary directly responsible for NOAA has explicitly stated opposition to dismantling the agency, creating a substantial roadblock to implementation.

2. **Implementation Complexity**: Breaking up NOAA involves six major offices, multiple functions distributed across 620 facilities, and potential legislative requirements. This complexity makes rapid implementation extremely challenging.

3. **Timeframe Constraints**: With only 46 days remaining until resolution date, and complex reorganizations typically exceeding the 45-60 day average for objective completion, the window is exceptionally tight.

4. **Partial Implementation Confusion**: The Project 2025 tracker's methodology for marking objectives "complete" is unclear - would partial implementation count? The objective specifically calls for breaking up NOAA, not merely downsizing it.

While some preparatory actions may be underway (reported layoffs, lease terminations), these fall far short of a complete breakup and may represent standard budget adjustments or targeted downsizing rather than implementation of the full Project 2025 recommendation.

## Probability calibration
Starting from the outside view estimate of 7%:

- **Commerce Secretary Opposition** (-4 percentage points): The explicit statement from Lutnick substantially decreases likelihood, as any breakup would likely require his department's cooperation.
- **Implementation Complexity** (-1.5 percentage points): Breaking up a major agency with multiple offices and functions is significantly more complex than average objectives.
- **Timeframe Constraints** (-1 percentage point): Only 46 days remain, below even the average completion timeframe for simpler objectives.
- **Reported Preparatory Actions** (+0.5 percentage points): Some downsizing may be underway, which could represent initial steps.

Calibrated inside view prediction: 1%

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Project 2025 Tracker mark "break up NOAA" complete in their spreadsheet before July 1, 2025 (46 days)?
2. Outside view: 7% base rate for complex reorganization objectives
3. Consistency: 1 out of 100 similar situations would see complex agency dismantling tracked as complete within this timeframe
4. Key evidence: Commerce Secretary opposes dismantling; complex reorganization typically slow; only 46 days remain; some downsizing may be underway
5. Blind spot: Executive order declaring reorganization intent could be incorrectly marked "complete" by tracker without actual implementation
6. Status quo: Strong pull toward status quo given complexity and timeframe

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of the question & resolution criteria  
   “Will the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet mark its ‘Break Up NOAA’ objective as complete by July 1, 2025?” The tracker must show “complete” (not “in progress”) on or before that date.  

2. Source analysis  
   • Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet (via Perplexity report, May 2025)  
     – Status: “Break Up NOAA” is marked “in progress.”  
     – Quality: High (directly tracks completion status).  

   • Axios, Jan 30 2025 (“Commerce nominee rejects NOAA breakup”)  
     – Reports Commerce Secretary‐designate Howard Lutnick disavowed the break-up plan under questioning.  
     – Quality: High (reliable politico reporting; based on public hearing transcripts).  

   • NPR, Feb 15 2025 (“Trump officials signal potential changes at NOAA”)  
     – NOAA staff “on high alert,” Project 2025 blueprint calls for breakup, but senior Commerce nominee punts specifics pending further review.  
     – Quality: High (detailed reporting; multiple on-the-record and anonymous sources).  

   • ABC News, early 2025 (“Privatize National Weather Service?”)  
     – Details Project 2025’s language on breaking up NOAA, quotes Lutnick saying he does not support dismantling NOAA/NWS.  
     – Quality: High (named sources, direct quotes).  

   • EDGI annotated Project 2025 excerpt (Heritage Foundation’s plan for NOAA)  
     – Lays out 14 sub-recommendations for breaking up/downsizing NOAA functions.  
     – Quality: Medium (authoritative in describing Project 2025 content but partisan annotation).  

   • Union of Concerned Scientists blog (Feb 12 2025)  
     – Expert viewpoint on critical public-safety functions at risk if NOAA is dismantled.  
     – Quality: Medium (named experts, but normative rather than status updates).  

   • News-Press opinion (Aug 2024)  
     – Regional op-ed warning of economic/climate risks in Florida if NOAA cuts occur.  
     – Quality: Low-Medium (opinion, less directly tied to current implementation).  

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   Strong evidence (large shifts)  
   – Lutnick’s explicit rejection of breakup in multiple hearings (Axios, ABC, NPR). Demonstrates top‐level executive resistance.  
   – Tracker status: objective still “in progress” as of mid-May, with no sign of marking “complete.”  

   Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)  
   – Historical average completion time for “in progress” Tracker objectives: ~45–60 days. Our window to July 1 is ~45 days.  
   – Signed executive actions on NOAA climate initiatives executed in ~21 days (but smaller in scope).  

   Weak evidence (small shifts)  
   – Implementation steps (layoffs, regional closures, IT audit) underway suggest administrative momentum.  
   – Vocal legal challenges from environmental groups may slow final administrative sign-off.  

4. Reference-class / outside view base rate  
   • Among Project 2025 objectives marked “in progress” as of mid-May, ~50% historically complete within 45 days.  

5. Timeframe analysis  
   • Forecast window: 47 days (May 15–July 1).  
   • If window halved (~23 days), probability would drop precipitously (<15%) because average completion time is ≥45 days.  
   • If window doubled (~94 days), probability would rise substantially (>60%), giving more buffer for Senate and legal delays.  

6. Inside-view justification & adjustments  
   Base rate: 50% (average for “in progress” objectives).  
   Downward adjustments (−25 points total):  
     a. Complexity & scope: Breaking up a large agency is far more complex than typical Project 2025 objectives (−10%).  
     b. Executive resistance: Commerce Secretary and other senior appointees publicly oppose this specific reform (−8%).  
     c. Senate/legal delays: Confirmation hearings cited as blockers; environmental groups preparing suits (−7%).  
   Upward adjustments (+5 points):  
     a. Implementation steps already underway show genuine administrative effort (+3%).  
     b. Narrow window: Admin may rush to mark small deliverables as “complete” before July 1 to show progress (+2%).  

   Adjusted probability = 50% − 25% + 5% = 30%.  

Probability calibration  
I assign a 30% probability that the “Break Up NOAA” objective will be marked “complete” by July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase & criteria in 30 words: ✓  
2. Base-rate (50% for similar in-progress objectives) noted: ✓  
3. Consistency check: “30 out of 100 times, this objective is marked complete by deadline.” ✓  
4. Top evidence (<20 words each):  
   • Lutnick’s repeated public rejection of NOAA breakup (Strong).  
   • Tracker still “in progress” as of May 2025 (Strong).  
   • Average completion time 45–60 days vs. 47-day window (Moderate).  
   • Complexity of agency reorganization (Moderate).  
   • Implementation steps underway (Weak).  
5. Blind-spot: Admin quietly redefines “complete” with symbolic action; might overstate progress.  
6. Status quo: Most likely nothing changes and objective remains “in progress.”

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of question and resolution criteria  
The question asks: “By July 1, 2025, will the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet mark the ‘Break Up NOAA’ objective as complete?” It resolves “Yes” only if that objective’s status on the public Tracker is exactly “complete” on or before July 1.  

2. Source analysis  
• EDGI-annotated excerpt (Scout Blum & C. Sellers, envirodatagov.org, date unknown but based on Project 2025’s Chapter 21)  
  – Quality: Direct excerpt from Project 2025, annotated by environmental historians. Highly reliable on content of the blueprint (the break-up proposals), opinion-laden on impacts. Dated mid-2024.  
• NPR article (Feb 15 2025)  
  – Quality: Established news outlet, multiple on-the-record quotes. Reports that Trump officials and senior nominees have signaled interest in NOAA reorganization but have not yet issued a break-up order. Reliable, current.  
• Wikipedia summary of Project 2025 (date retrieved early 2025)  
  – Quality: Summarizes Project 2025 objectives including dismantling NOAA. Good for baseline, but secondary.  
• UCS blog (Feb 12 2025)  
  – Quality: Advocacy source pointing out risks of NOAA dismantling. Reliable on NOAA’s current performance; opinion-driven on risks.  
• ABC News (Feb 5 2025)  
  – Quality: Well-sourced reporting on internal reviews, proposed NOAA cuts, and Commerce Secretary nominee’s stance. Reliable; documents lack of concrete break-up actions.  
• R/Keep_Track Project 2025 Tracker status (Perplexity report, early May 2025)  
  – Quality: Community-sourced spreadsheet data. Less formally audited but likely accurate on “in progress” vs. “complete” tags.  

3. Reference-class and outside-view base rate  
• On the Tracker, of ~297 objectives, 107 (36%) are “complete” overall; among 45 “in progress” as of early May, historically ~36% eventually complete.  
• Average in-progress objective takes 45–60 days to go from “in progress” to “complete.”  

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
  a. Multiple independent sources (EDGI, Wikipedia, NPR, ABC) confirm Project 2025 blueprint explicitly calls for breaking up NOAA. (Confirms the objective’s existence; no shift in probability.)  
  b. Axios report (Jan 30 2025) and ABC News quotes of Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick rejecting dismantling NOAA at confirmation hearings. Strong, on-the-record opposition. (Lowers probability.)  
  c. No executive order, draft legislation, or verifiable public action to break up NOAA has been reported in >100 days since the plan was public. (Lowers probability.)  

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
  d. Tracker community’s average in-progress completion time (45–60 days) vs. only 47 days remaining until resolution. (Lowers probability moderately.)  
  e. Institutional complexity: breaking up a large federal agency requires high-level legal, budgetary, and interagency actions plus likely Congressional pushback. (Lowers probability.)  

Weak evidence (small shifts):  
  f. Fear and demoralization among NOAA staff (NPR, ABC) may speed small cosmetic reorganizations but not a full break-up. (Negligible shift.)  
  g. Project 2025 momentum: early admin actions have mirrored other blueprint elements, implying some traction—but none on NOAA break-up yet. (Small uptick for possibility, but weak.)  

5. Timeframe analysis  
• Today: May 15, 2025. Resolution: July 1, 2025. Δ = 47 days.  
• Halved timeframe (23 days): far below average completion time → probability would drop further (e.g. from ~15% to ~8%).  
• Doubled timeframe (94 days): more time could allow laggards to finish → probability might rise modestly toward the 36% base rate, say to ~25%.  

6. Justification & probability shifts  
Start with outside-view base rate of 36% for in-progress objectives.  
• Time constraint (47 days vs. 45–60 days average) → reduce to ~25%.  
• High complexity/legal hurdles + explicit denial by Commerce Secretary nominee → further reduce to ~15%.  
• Lack of any public action over 100 days → no upward adjustment.  

Thus my inside-view forecast is 15%.  

Probability calibration  
Given the strong institutional barriers, explicit leadership opposition, and tight timeline, a probability substantially below the 36% base rate is warranted. A 15% forecast captures a low but non-zero chance of a last-minute order or surprise legal mechanism slipping through. A ±10% shift would represent a major new development (e.g., a leaked executive order draft or a sudden leadership reversal).  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Question concerns marking “Break Up NOAA” complete on Tracker by July 1, 2025. ✔  
2. Base rate: 36% for in-progress objectives. ✔  
3. Consistency check: “15 times out of 100, the Tracker will mark NOAA break-up complete by July 1.” ✔  
4. Top evidence (20 words max each):  
   • Nominee Lutnick’s on-record rejection of NOAA break-up (Axios, ABC).  
   • No executive orders or public actions in >100 days despite heavy monitoring (NPR, ABC).  
   • Average completion 45–60 days vs. 47 days left.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden classified executive action or legal redefinition could slip the objective to “complete” without public notice, raising odds.  
6. Status quo: Most Tracker items change slowly. Given no signs of rapid movement, default to status quo (“in progress”) and low completion odds.

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• EDGI annotated chapter (Aug 2024): primary‐source excerpts from Project 2025 plus scholarly annotation; high factual value on what the blueprint proposes, low predictive value on timing.  
• NPR (15 Feb 2025): straight news, quoting NOAA staff, Commerce-nominee Howard Lutnick, and outside experts; reliable; gives most recent public statements from administration.  
• Wikipedia Project 2025 (last updated early 2025): tertiary compilation, good for broad context, lower authority.  
• UCS blog (12 Feb 2025) and News-Press op-ed (Aug 2024): advocacy pieces; facts about NOAA’s current activities are solid, forward-looking opinions discounted.  
• ABC News (Mar 2025): investigative news with named meteorologists, Commerce-secretary quotes, and unnamed government sources; high factual quality on layoffs and policy direction.  
• Perplexity/Tracker write-up (6 May 2025): secondary report on the Google sheet we care about; confirms the row is still “In progress”. Moderate reliability (publicly visible sheet can be checked).  
Across all sources, only the NPR and ABC articles give near-term, inside-government signals; both report turbulence but no completed break-up order.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (downward pressure)  
– U.S. law and historical precedent: dismantling or transferring a sub-cabinet agency the size of NOAA normally requires legislation; no such bill has moved.  
– Howard Lutnick (Commerce nominee) on record in Senate hearing (30 Jan 2025) saying he does not support dismantling NOAA.  
Moderate evidence (mixed)  
– Multiple news outlets (NPR, ABC) confirm staff are preparing for cuts and partial reorganisation, indicating some momentum.  
– Tracker maintainers often mark items “complete” on the basis of signed executive orders, even if follow-through is uncertain (Perplexity analysis).  
Weak evidence (minor upward)  
– Anonymous claims of 1,000 layoffs and curtailed balloon launches could foreshadow a headline executive order.  
– Heritage/Project 2025 language continues to be cited by sympathetic political appointees.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
46 days remain (15 May → 1 Jul 2025).  Historical sheet activity: 5-8 completions per month, the vast majority simple roll-backs or regulatory suspensions.  If the window were doubled to 92 days I would raise the probability roughly ×1.5 (to ~5 %), mainly because a midsummer reorg could accompany the FY 2026 budget.  If halved to 23 days I would cut the probability by roughly half (to ~1.5 %).  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate for a big-ticket structural item moving from “In progress” to “Complete” in any given 45-day window was set at 2 %.  
Negative adjustments  
• Structural/legal obstacles (strong) –0.7 pp  
• Commerce Secretary’s explicit rejection (moderate) –0.3 pp  
Positive adjustments  
• Evidence of internal downsizing plans (moderate) +0.5 pp  
• Tracker’s lenient completion criteria (moderate) +0.8 pp  
Net shift: +0.3 pp → 2.3 %, rounded to 3 % for ease of communication and to acknowledge residual tail risks (Friday-evening executive order, tracker subjectivity).  

Probability calibration
I expect that roughly 3 times in 100 parallel worlds the Google sheet will show the NOAA break-up row as “Complete” when Metaculus checks on or after 1 July 2025.  Uncertainty: ±2 pp (90 % CI 1–5 %).  A ±10 % absolute shift would be unjustified given the paucity of concrete action signs and the short window.

6. Status quo bias: inertia favours “In progress” remaining; short window reinforces that outcome.
