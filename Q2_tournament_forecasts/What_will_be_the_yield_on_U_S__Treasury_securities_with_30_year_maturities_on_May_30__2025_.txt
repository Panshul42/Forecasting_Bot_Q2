Historical output: Analysis:
The 30‑year Treasury yield (FRED series DGS30) has trended down since its 1981 peak (~15%) but exhibits pronounced cycles tied to Fed policy shifts, inflation shocks, and changing term premia. Key historical episodes include the late‑1990s tech bubble, the 2008 financial crisis slump, the 2013 Taper Tantrum, 2020 COVID collapse, and the 2022–23 post‑pandemic inflation‑driven surge to ~4.3%. For an out‑view baseline, one could compute a long‑run average or median yield (e.g., ~4.0% since 2000) or examine the mean over the past five years (~3.2%). From today’s ~4.2% yield, drivers through May 2025 include Fed rate cuts (expected mid‑2025), inflation resolving toward 2%, fiscal deficits pressuring term premia, and global demand for safe assets. To inform the base‑rate forecast, we need daily historical DGS30 data, major inflection events, contemporaneous Fed statements, and market‑implied expectations (e.g., T‑bond futures curves). This groundwork will form an out‑view against which we layer recent news on monetary policy and inflation to generate our inside‑view forecast.

Key facts and figures  
• US 10‑year Treasury yields jumped to 4.51% at one point this week, settling at 4.27% on Thursday—well below their late‑2023 peak of nearly 5% and far below 1980s double‑digit levels.  
• At one stage, 10‑year yields were set for their largest weekly rise in over a decade.  
• US junk‑bond yields rose to 8.38% (ICE BofA index), up almost a full percentage point from a week earlier.  
• Mortgage rates, benchmarked to 10‑year Treasuries, jumped over 20 bp before calming.  
• Japan’s 30‑year government‑bond yield hit 21‑year highs; Britain’s 30‑year yield reached its highest since 1998 before easing.  
• Bid‑ask spreads in the Treasury market briefly doubled, signaling strains reminiscent of March 2020’s “dash‑for‑cash.”  
• China held $761 billion of US Treasuries in January, making it the second‑largest foreign holder after Japan.

Named sources and opinions  
• Saurav Ghosh (Economic Times): Recommends a 33‑33‑33 portfolio split across short‑term corporate bonds, longer‑tenor G‑Secs, and high‑rated corporates, especially as India eyes rate cuts.  
• Yardeni Research: “The Bond Vigilantes have struck again,” noting they have a “100% success rate in US markets.”  
• ICE BofA index: Tracks the jump in US junk‑bond yields to 8.38%.

Other observations (less formally sourced)  
• Some market participants warn that an unwinding of hedge‑fund “basis trades” (selling futures/swaps while buying cash Treasuries with leverage) amplified the selloff when prime brokerages demanded cash.  
• Speculation persists that China could begin offloading US Treasuries, though any large‐scale move would show up only gradually in official data.

Context and implications  
• Treasury selloffs raise government borrowing costs, which filter through to mortgages and corporate loans, potentially damping economic activity.  
• Recent volatility echoes previous strains: March 2020’s market dislocation and the UK’s 2022 mini‑budget crisis.  
• The episode underscores the Treasury market’s central role in global financial stability—and the influence of so‑called “bond vigilantes” in enforcing fiscal discipline.

Here’s a concise summary of the Reuters (April 9, 2025) article by Davide Barbuscia:

• Treasury‐market moves since Trump’s inauguration  
  – In the weeks after January 2025, the 10‑year U.S. Treasury yield fell by roughly 50 basis points as markets rallied.  
  – Throughout that rally the “term premium” (the extra compensation investors demand for holding long‑dated Treasuries) stayed positive—a sign of lingering unease.  

• Reversal on trade‐tariff news  
  – After President Trump announced wide‑ranging tariffs, Treasury yields spiked, wiping out much of the post‑inauguration decline; yields now sit only about 20 basis points below their January levels.  
  – The New York Fed’s model–based 10‑year term premium jumped from 25 bps at the end of last week to nearly 60 bps on Tuesday, underscoring rising policy‑risk concerns.  

• What drives the term premium?  
  – It reflects uncertainty about future monetary policy and U.S. creditworthiness.  
  – Emanuel Moench (co‑developer of the Fed’s model) calls it a “statistical proxy of the risk in the Treasury market,” noting that if Treasuries lose safe‑haven status, the term premium should rise.  
  – Benson Durham (Piper Sandler) adds it also captures political and fiscal‐deficit risks.  

• Investor worries over Trump’s policies  
  – Seven named investors/analysts cite growing risks to U.S. creditworthiness from:  
    • Tariffs on major trading partners (spooking markets and threatening growth)  
    • Unconventional debt‑management ideas and big tax cuts (potentially worsening the $36 trillion debt pile)  
    • Disruption of business confidence and the federal bureaucracy  
  – Ronald Temple (Lazard) warns that policy uncertainty—around government stability and rule of law—could raise the cost of capital “over time.”  

• Foreign‐holder dynamics and institutional risk  
  – Matt Smith (Ruffer) notes that creditor nations (e.g. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Germany) might begin hedging or unwinding dollar exposures if U.S. policy risks persist.  
  – David Page (AXA IM) says rating agencies are monitoring possible erosions of U.S. institutional strength and rule of law, factors critical to credit‐risk assessments.

# US 30-Year Treasury Yield Historical Analysis (2000-2025): Macroeconomic Drivers and Market Dynamics  

The 30-year US Treasury yield has experienced significant volatility since 2000, reflecting macroeconomic shocks, monetary policy shifts, and structural changes in debt markets. Key inflection points include the 2000 dot-com crash (6.75% peak), the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (2.53% trough), the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic (0.99% historic low), and the post-2022 inflation surge (4.98% 2025 high). This analysis identifies six major phases of yield movements, driven by Federal Reserve interventions, fiscal policy responses, inflation dynamics, and global risk sentiment[3][5][9].  

---

## Section 1: Yield Trajectory and Structural Shifts (2000–2008)  

### Subsection 1.1: Dot-Com Aftermath and Pre-Crisis Stability (2000–2006)  
The 30-year yield began the millennium at 6.48% in January 2000 amid tight monetary policy targeting 5.75–6.00% federal funds rates[3][9]. As the dot-com bubble deflated, the Fed cut rates 11 times between 2000 and 2003, driving yields down to 4.70% by June 2003—a 178 basis point (bp) decline[3][12]. This period also saw the temporary suspension of 30-year Treasury issuance from February 2002 to February 2006, creating artificial scarcity that suppressed yields despite expanding fiscal deficits from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars[1][3].  

### Subsection 1.2: Housing Bubble and Global Financial Crisis (2007–2008)  
Yields rebounded to 5.29% in June 2006 as the Fed normalized rates, but the subprime mortgage crisis precipitated a 276 bp plunge to 2.53% by December 2008[3][9]. This mirrored the flight to safety during Lehman Brothers' collapse, with Treasury purchases surging despite a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that expanded federal borrowing[12][13]. The yield curve steepened dramatically as short-term rates hit 0–0.25% while long-term yields reflected deflationary fears[9][13].  

---

## Section 2: Zero Interest Rate Policy and Quantitative Easing (2009–2019)  

### Subsection 2.1: Post-Crisis Stabilization (2009–2012)  
The Fed’s November 2008 QE1 program initiated $1.75 trillion in Treasury and MBS purchases, capping 30-year yields below 4.76% through 2012[3][12]. Despite S&P’s 2011 US credit rating downgrade, yields fell to 2.76% as European sovereign debt crises diverted capital to US markets[3][9].  

### Subsection 2.2: Taper Tantrum and Normalization Attempts (2013–2019)  
Ben Bernanke’s May 2013 taper announcement triggered a 140 bp yield spike to 3.96%, though renewed QE3+ purchases limited peaks to 3.48% by 2014[3][12]. The 2016–2018 Fed rate hikes lifted yields to 3.46%, but trade wars and falling inflation expectations drove a 112 bp retreat to 2.34% by August 2019[3][5][9].  

---

## Section 3: Pandemic-Era Extremes and Inflation Surge (2020–2025)  

### Subsection 3.1: COVID-19 Crisis and Emergency Policy (2020–2021)  
The Fed’s March 2020 rate cut to 0–0.25% and $1.7 trillion Treasury purchases pushed 30-year yields to a historic 0.99% low[3][5]. Unprecedented fiscal stimulus ($5.2 trillion across CARES Act/ARPA) initially failed to lift yields, as deflationary fears dominated[9][12].  

### Subsection 3.2: Post-Vaccine Reflation and Inflation Overshoot (2021–2023)  
Yields surged 341 bps to 4.40% by October 2023, driven by CPI inflation peaking at 9.1% (June 2022) and Fed funds rate hikes to 5.25–5.50%[3][5][10]. Term premia expanded due to debt ceiling debates and a $1.9 trillion infrastructure bill, elevating Treasury supply concerns[12][13].  

### Subsection 3.3: Soft Landing and Yield Stabilization (2024–2025)  
Despite 2024’s 4.82% yield peak, moderating inflation (3.7% CPI as of March 2025) and Fed pauses have anchored yields near 4.70–4.88%[2][5][9]. Structural deficits exceeding 5% of GDP and $1.2 trillion annual Treasury issuance maintain upward pressure, offset by strong foreign central bank demand[5][12][13].  

---

## Section 4: Key Macroeconomic Drivers of Yield Fluctuations  

### Subsection 4.1: Monetary Policy and Forward Guidance  
The Fed’s dual mandate (price stability/full employment) directly impacts short-term rates, while long-term yields incorporate expectations for future policy paths[9][12]. For example, the 2013–2018 dot plot projections created asymmetric reactions, with yields overshooting during hawkish signals and undershooting during dovish pivots[12][13].  

### Subsection 4.2: Fiscal Policy and Debt Supply Dynamics  
Since 2000, US federal debt/GDP ratio surged from 55% to 128%, requiring increasing Treasury issuance[3][12]. Each 1% of GDP deficit expansion historically adds 15–25 bps to 30-year yields, though QE muted this effect post-2008[12][13]. Post-2020, reduced Fed participation (QT) and larger auctions have heightened supply sensitivity[5][12].  

### Subsection 4.3: Inflation Expectations and Term Premia  
Breakeven inflation rates (derived from TIPS) explain 60–70% of nominal yield moves since 2003[8][10]. The 2021–2023 surge saw 30-year breakevens peak at 2.55%, adding 150 bps to nominal yields[8][10]. Real term premia, reflecting uncertainty and risk appetite, contributed another 120 bps during this period[10][12].  

### Subsection 4.4: Global Risk Sentiment and Alternatives  
30-year yields exhibit strong inverse correlation (–0.87 since 2000) with equity market volatility (VIX)[9]. During crises, Treasury’s safe-haven status dominates; in expansions, capital flows to equities/corporates raise yields. Post-2010, foreign holdings (peaking at 49% in 2013) became a stabilizing force, though reduced to 38% by 2025[5][12].  

---

## Section 5: Comparative Analysis of Peak/Trough Episodes  

### Subsection 5.1: 2000–2003 Dot-Com/9-11 Recession  
- **Peak**: 6.75% (January 2000) – Tight monetary policy, tech bubble optimism[3][9]  
- **Trough**: 4.40% (June 2003) – Post-9/11 rate cuts, Iraq war uncertainty[3][13]  

### Subsection 5.2: 2007–2008 Global Financial Crisis  
- **Pre-Crisis High**: 5.29% (June 2006) – Fed normalization, housing boom[3][9]  
- **Crisis Low**: 2.53% (December 2008) – Flight to safety, Fed ZIRP[3][12]  

### Subsection 5.3: 2020–2021 COVID-19 Pandemic  
- **Pre-Pandemic**: 2.39% (December 2019) – Trade war resolution hopes[3][5]  
- **Pandemic Low**: 0.99% (March 2020) – Emergency QE, deflation fears[3][12]  

### Subsection 5.4: 2022–2025 Inflation Cycle  
- **Trough**: 3.94% (April 2023) – Banking crisis, Fed pause speculation[2][5]  
- **Recent High**: 4.98% (April 2025) – Sticky services inflation, supply overhangs[2][5][10]  

---

## Section 6: Current Yield Determinants and Forward Projections  

### Subsection 6.1: 2025 Yield Drivers  
As of April 2025, 30-year yields average 4.71%, comprising:  
- Expected real short-term rates: 2.10%  
- Inflation expectations: 2.40%  
- Term premia: 0.30%  
This decomposition reflects moderating inflation but elevated real rates from persistent deficits[5][8][10].  

### Subsection 6.2: Structural Challenges  
The Congressional Budget Office projects debt/GDP reaching 139% by 2033, requiring annual Treasury issuance exceeding $2 trillion[12][13]. Absent Fed intervention, historical models suggest this could add 50–75 bps to 30-year yields versus pre-2020 norms[12][13].  

### Subsection 6.3: Scenario Analysis  
- **Bull Case (3.50%)**: Requires Fed cuts to 2.5% with inflation at 2% and $800 billion fiscal contraction[5][12].  
- **Bear Case (5.75%)**: Triggered by stagflation (4% inflation + 1% growth) and loss of foreign demand[10][12].  

---

## Conclusion  

The 30-year Treasury yield has transitioned from a monetary policy transmission channel to a barometer of fiscal sustainability and global risk appetite. While cyclical factors like Fed rate cycles remain influential, structural shifts in debt markets and inflationary regimes suggest yields will stabilize above pre-2020 levels. Investors must monitor debt issuance calendars, inflation expectations surveys, and geopolitical risk indicators to navigate this evolving landscape.</Perplexity_report>

Current output: Analysis:
The key drivers of 30‑year Treasury yields over the next five weeks will be Fed policy expectations, inflation dynamics, supply/demand technicals and risk sentiment.  Historically, 30‑year yields averaged around 3.5% before the 2020s spike; they recently traded near 4.0–4.2% amid sticky inflation and a Fed on hold.  To form an inside view, I need up‑to‑the‑minute Fed meeting minutes or speeches (to gauge any shift toward cuts or further hawkish lean), the latest April CPI/PCE releases (for real return expectations), recent long‑bond auction results and dealer positioning (including basis‐trade unwinds), and any shifts in foreign demand or safe‑haven flows.  Understanding these will let me adjust my base‐rate forecast of roughly 4.1% toward a more precise prediction for May 30.

Here’s a concise summary of the NBC Bay Area article “10‑year Treasury yield rises to highest since April as Fed notes upside risk to inflation” (Jan. 8, 2025). All data are as reported in the article.

Facts and figures:
• 10‑year Treasury yield  
  – Topped 4.70% intraday (highest since late April)  
  – Last quoted at 4.677% (down nearly 1 bp from the peak)  
• 2‑year Treasury yield  
  – 4.274% (down 2 bps)  
• 30‑year Treasury yield  
  – 4.918% (up by less than 1 bp)  
• Basis point definition: 1 bp = 0.01%

Fed minutes (reliable, named source):
• “Almost all participants judged that upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased.”  
• Committee members “indicated that the Committee was at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing.”

Context:
• Fed officials worried that incoming President Trump’s immigration and trade policies could add to inflationary pressures, leading them to signal a slower pace of rate cuts.  
• ADP data showed December private‑sector job growth below expectations and the slowest wage growth since July 2021.  
• Bond yields had also risen on December’s ISM services price index, which pointed to more job openings than expected for November.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the CNBC article “10‑year Treasury yield rises as investors weigh Trump’s criticism of Powell” (April 21, 2025) by Lisa Kailai Han, Natasha Turak and Katrina Bishop. 

Key Facts and Figures  
• 10‑year U.S. Treasury yield: up 8 basis points to 4.409% on Monday.  
• 2‑year U.S. Treasury yield: down 3 basis points to 3.764%.  
• One basis point = 0.01%.  
• Bond markets were closed Friday for the Easter holiday.  

Market Moves  
• Equities sold off; the U.S. dollar reached three‑year highs.  
• Gold surged to a record above $3,400 per ounce.  

Drivers and Commentary  
• President Trump sharply criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell via Truth Social, calling him a “major loser” and demanding immediate rate cuts:  
  – “With these costs trending so nicely downward…there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.”  
  – In a separate press exchange, Trump said, “If we had a Fed Chairman that understood what he was doing, interest rates would be coming down, too.”  
• White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the administration is considering whether firing Powell is an option.  
• Interactive Brokers senior economist José Torres:  
  – Warns that Trump’s confrontational stance “makes investors wonder if the Fed’s inflation mandate will go out the window,” clouding the appeal of global safe‑haven assets and helping push gold to new highs.  

Fed Chair Powell’s Prior Warning  
• In a speech last week, Powell cautioned that U.S. tariffs pose risks to both growth and inflation, making it challenging to “temper inflation and support growth” simultaneously.

Here’s a concise extraction of the key points from John Melloy’s April 9, 2025 CNBC article:

Facts & Statistics  
• 10‑year Treasury note  
 – Overnight high: 4.51%  
 – Last: up 5 bps at 4.31% (was below 3.90% as recently as last week)  
• 30‑year Treasury bond  
 – Overnight high: 5.02% (first since November 2023)  
 – Last: 4.715%  
• 2‑year Treasury note: up nearly 17 bps to 3.908%  
• Auction of $39 billion in 10‑year Treasurys  
 – Bid‑cover ratio: 2.67 (much stronger than prior)  
 – “Indirect” bids: >87% (proxy for foreign demand)  
• Fed funds target rate: 4.25%–4.50%  

Context & Drivers  
• A 90‑day pause in some Trump‑announced tariffs briefly eased fixed‑income market worries; subsequent tariff hikes on Chinese goods (to 104%, then 125%) have kept trade tensions high.  
• Equities sold off sharply (S&P 500 down ~12% over four trading days), yet bond yields rose—unusual when recession fears typically send investors into Treasurys.  

Named Opinions (reliable sources)  
• Henry Allen (macroeconomic strategist, Deutsche Bank): “U.S. Treasury markets are experiencing an incredibly aggressive selloff … losing their traditional haven status.”  
• David Zervos (chief market strategist, Jefferies): In a trade war, foreign holders could use U.S. financial assets as “nuclear option” to create problems—though Wednesday’s auction showed they weren’t yet doing so.  
• Ed Yardeni (Yardeni Research): Despite the Trump administration’s credit for lower bond yields, “the 10‑year Treasury bond yield is up,” suggesting concerns that China and others “might start selling their U.S. Treasuries.”  

Other Observations  
• Possible drivers of the selloff include forced hedge‑fund liquidations and speculation about foreign‑holder dumping.  
• Long‑term yields could climb further even if the Fed cuts rates, as looser policy might stoke inflation expectations.  
• President Trump acknowledged monitoring the “tricky” bond market and said he found current yields “beautiful,” despite overnight queasiness.

  • 30‑year Treasury yields rose 12 basis points on Wednesday to 4.835%. At one point during the sell‑off they posted their biggest three‑day jump since 1982.  
  • The U.S. dollar and equities rebounded after President Trump announced a 90‑day pause on most new tariffs (but raised China tariffs to 125% immediately).  
  • The U.S. 2‑year/10‑year yield curve steepened by about 30 bps in a few hours—“pretty extreme by anyone’s metrics,” per Candriam’s Jamie Niven.  

2. Drivers of the sell‑off  
  • Forced selling by hedge funds engaged in “basis trades”: when prime brokers demanded more margin or cut leverage, funds sold cash Treasuries to raise collateral.  
  • The spread between Treasury yields and swap rates at the 10‑year point blew out to 64 bps—the largest on record—reflecting that dislocation.  

3. Auction outcomes and official remarks  
  • A late‑morning 10‑year Treasury auction came in within market expectations, providing “further relief,” though uncertainty lingered.  
  • Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (in Fox Business interviews) said he hadn’t seen anything systemic and attributed part of the rout to market misunderstanding of the tariff plan.  

4. Named opinions from reliable sources  
  • “The market has lost faith in U.S. assets,” wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a research note.  
  • Marc Rowan (Apollo Global Management CEO): Worried about damage to the U.S. brand.  
  • Carol Schleif (BMO Private Wealth): “The 90‑day suspension does allow nice breathing room … yet the uncertainty for companies remains.”  
  • Mukesh Dave (Aravali Asset Management CIO): When prime brokers tighten margin, “these guys obviously will have to sell.”  
  • Jamie Niven (Candriam senior portfolio manager): Noted the 2s‑10s curve steepening “pretty extreme by anyone’s metrics.”  
  • Grace Tam (BNP Paribas Wealth Management): Warned markets worry China and others could “dump” U.S. Treasuries as retaliation.  

5. Less‑reliable/anonymous observations  
  • Several unnamed market sources said trading, though volatile, remained orderly and dislocations hadn’t reached crisis levels.  
  • Some analysts and investors suggested a structural shift: Trump’s tariffs could slow global trade flows and foreign demand for U.S. debt over the longer term.

Query: What’s the latest on Fed policy signals, April inflation data, and Treasury auction outcomes that might move 30-year Treasury yields into late April 2025?
Here are the relevant news articles:

**US Bond Yields Rise Amid Trade Policy Uncertainty**
The recent rise in US 10-year bond yields has caused concern among investors. The yield rose from 4.01% to 4.49% despite weaker consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) numbers. The increase in yields is attributed to the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's trade policies, including the recently announced tariffs on 60 countries. The tariffs, which were initially set to take effect on April 9, were postponed for 90 days due to market volatility. The yield curve has steepened, and the 10-year yield has risen above 4.5%. This has led to concerns about inflation and the potential for a recession. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has been cautious in its response, with Chairman Jerome Powell stating that the Fed is now more cautious due to the new tariffs, which are expected to have a more significant impact on the economy. The yield curve has steepened, and the 10-year yield has risen above 4.5%. This has led to concerns about inflation and the potential for a recession. The article also discusses the recent shift in the Fed's strategy, with a focus on short-term debt and a reduction in the issuance of long-term bonds. This has led to concerns about the potential for a bond market crisis. The article concludes by stating that investors should remain vigilant and monitor the situation closely.

**Buyers Strike Arrives: Foreign Demand For 2Y Treasury Auction Craters To 2 Year Low | ZeroHedge**
The $69 billion 2-year Treasury auction priced at a high yield of 3.795%, the lowest since last September. However, the auction saw a significant decline in foreign demand, with the April Indirect takedown at just 56.2%, the lowest since the bank bailout crisis in March 2023. This has led to a collapse in indirect bids, with direct bids increasing to 13.7%, the highest since last month. The article suggests that if foreign demand continues to drop, the Fed may have to restart quantitative easing (QE) to provide a backstop to the US Treasury. The author notes that the remaining coupon auctions will be closely watched to see if foreigners are finally done funding the US debt, leaving only the Fed's QE as an option.

**Investor Concerns Drive US Treasury Yield Surge**
Investors' concerns about the US economy and the Federal Reserve's policy have led to a surge in long-term bond yields and a significant increase in the premium for hedging against interest rate risk. The put (sell) price of US Treasury options has risen to its highest level since the 2021 'Flash Crash', surpassing the call (buy) price. This extreme positioning highlights the growing anxiety among investors, fueled by concerns about the impact of Trump's trade policies and the Fed's potential policy mistakes. The recent market volatility and policy uncertainty have led to a significant increase in the term premium, with the 30-year Treasury yield reaching 4.88% on April 22, its highest level in three months. Lawrence Gilham, Chief Fixed Income Strategist at LPL Financial, notes that 'foreign investors' selling of dollar assets is contributing to market volatility, and that 'concerns about the Fed's independence and the possibility of premature rate cuts' are also contributing to the rise in long-term bond yields.

**U.S. short-term yields climb With Treasury auctions set to begin**
U.S. short-term Treasury yields rose on Tuesday, while European counterparts declined, as investors became cautious about U.S. assets due to a pending auction of two-year notes and Federal Reserve speakers. U.S. two-year yields increased by up to five basis points to 3.81%, while Germany's two-year yield fell by as much as six basis points to its lowest level since 2022. Research by John Velis at BNY Markets found that 'there's an ongoing retreat by cross-border real money investors' from U.S. bond markets, including the Treasury market. The Treasury Department plans to sell $69 billion of new two-year notes in a monthly auction, which is expected to draw the lowest yield for a two-year note auction since September. According to John Canavan, strategist at Oxford Economics, 'the risks to Treasury auctions in the current environment have been adding the pressure on the front-end.' Investors have driven short-term Treasury yields lower anticipating that the Trump administration's tariffs agenda will hurt U.S. economic growth later in the year, leading the Fed to cut interest rates. Derivatives markets are almost fully pricing in a quarter-point rate cut in July and a cumulative 90 basis points of easing by year-end. Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson emphasized the central bank's commitment to low and stable inflation for economic mobility. European investors are repatriating some of their investments in the US, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management. 'We expect that trend to continue as long as tariff policies and other anti-globalization policies are seriously discussed.'

**Trump's Attack on Powell Sparks Concerns Over Federal Reserve Independence**
US President Donald Trump has intensified pressure on Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, to lower interest rates, calling him a 'loser' and warning of an economic slowdown. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, 'There can hardly be inflation, but there can be an economic slowdown unless Mr. Behind, a major loser, lowers interest rates NOW.' The comments have raised concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve and triggered new sales of US assets, including stocks, dollars, and government bonds. The US dollar has fallen to its lowest level in three years, with its index falling just above 98, its lowest level since March 2022. The euro has risen against the greenback, exceeding 1.05 to reach its highest level since November 2021. The Swiss franc has also strengthened, reaching unprecedented levels since 2015, when the Swiss National Bank removed its currency's peg to the euro. US government bonds have also seen a significant decline due to the rise in yields, particularly for long-term Treasury bonds. The yields of 10-year and 30-year Treasury bonds have increased by 8 and 10 basis points, reaching 4.4% and 4.9% respectively. Michael Brown, chief research strategist at Pepperstone in London, warns that a removal of Jerome Powell would lead to 'enormous volatility on financial markets' and a 'spectacular exit of US assets.' 'If this were to happen, the dollar's reserve status and the safe-haven value of Treasury bonds would be annihilated, probably permanently in both cases,' he warns. According to Brown, a removal of Powell would also lead to a significant increase in inflation and a decrease in economic growth. Jerome Powell has stated that he prefers to wait for greater clarity before adjusting interest rates, saying, 'For now, we are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustment to our policy.' Donald Trump has responded by calling for Powell's resignation, saying, 'His firing will never come soon enough.' The administration is reportedly considering the possibility of removing Powell, who was appointed by Trump but enjoys significant independence and can only be removed for 'good cause,' a term not clearly defined in US law. Powell's four-year term is set to expire on May 15, 2026.

**IIF Forecasts Mild Recession in the US for the Second Half of 2025**
The International Institute of Finance (IIF) has updated its baseline to include a mild recession in the United States for the second half of 2025, with sequential negative growth in the third and fourth quarters, and annual averages of 1.4% in 2025 and 0.8% in 2026. The report, released on Monday, April 21, notes that while data up to the start of 2025 still reflects the residual strength from the end of last year, high-frequency signals are starting to change. The IIF states, 'Although the concrete data up to the beginning of 2025 still reflects the residual strength from the end of last year, the high-frequency signals are starting to change. The consumer sentiment has deteriorated significantly and the tone of policy communication continues to be volatile.' It is likely that the new US tariff structure will raise the core PCE inflation to 4.6% by the end of the year, mainly when the effects of the pass-through begin to appear in intermediate and consumption goods, warns the institute. The report maintains the prediction that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will start reducing interest rates after the July meeting. The IIF's base scenario includes three 25-basis-point cuts in the second half of this year and three more in 2026. Regarding job creation, future indicators are decreasing, according to the analysis. The IIF adds, 'The signals are not yet flashing red, but the direction is unmistakable. Labor demand is losing strength, particularly in cyclically exposed sectors, and it is likely that we will see a more visible weakening as the policy tightening and tariff effects spread through the economy.'

**Long-dated yields rise as Trump ramps up attacks on Powell**
Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields rose on Monday as investors reacted to President Donald Trump's escalating attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump called for interest rate cuts on social media, saying the economy could decelerate unless Powell acts. Investors are concerned about volatile policymaking and the potential for an economic slowdown or recession. 'Markets are just very headline sensitive right now,' said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. The Treasury term premium has risen to 67 basis points, reflecting uncertainty around U.S. policymaking. The 2/10 yield curve has steepened to its highest level in over three years, signaling expectations of stronger economic activity, higher inflation, and higher interest rates over the long term.

**Trump warns of economic slowdown unless Fed cuts rates, triggering selloff**
President Donald Trump warned that the US economy could slow unless interest rates are lowered immediately, repeating his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump said, 'With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.' The comments sent stock markets lower and bond yields higher, as investors and analysts mulled the fallout of a potential fight over the Fed's monetary policy independence. The Fed next meets on May 6-7 and is widely expected to hold the benchmark interest rate steady in the current 4.25% to 4.50% range. The growth outlook and overall sentiment have both been falling as Trump's tariff policies are expected to drive inflation back to 4% or higher through the rest of the year.

**US Treasury Auction Shows Weak Demand from Foreign Buyers**
The demand for 2-year US Treasury bonds from foreign buyers has dropped to a 2-year low, with the yield on the latest auction reaching 3.795%, the lowest since September last year. The auction's bid-to-cover ratio was 2.52, the lowest since October last year. In contrast to recent auctions, the number of 'direct bidders' (including institutional investors and individuals) increased to 30.1%, while 'indirect bidders' (including foreign central banks) decreased to 56.2%, the lowest since the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank crisis. As ZeroHedge commented, the auction's performance was mediocre, and if not for the direct bidders filling the gap left by foreign buyers, the results could have been worse. The trend suggests that foreign demand for US debt has weakened, and if it continues, the Federal Reserve may need to restart quantitative easing to support the market. The market will closely watch the remaining US Treasury auctions this week, especially whether foreign investors have truly stopped buying US debt.

**Dollar Plunges to Three-Year Low as Trump's Criticism of Fed Intensifies**
The US dollar index plummeted to a three-year low on Monday, April 21, as tensions between US President Trump and Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Powell escalated. Investors are concerned about the potential erosion of the Fed's independence and the escalating US-China trade tensions, which have shaken market confidence. According to FactSet data, the ICE US Dollar Index touched 97.92, its lowest level since March 2022. As of 8:00 am ET, the index had fallen 1.2% for the day, trading at 98.14. The dollar has been weakening significantly this year, with Trump's criticism of the Fed and US trade policies intensifying since his inauguration in January. The announcement of a global 'reciprocal tax' policy on April 2 further heightened market uncertainty. Trump's recent public criticism of Powell's failure to cut interest rates and White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett's statement that the White House is considering whether it has the authority to remove Powell have been seen as a clear signal to undermine the Fed's independence, further eroding dollar confidence. Evercore ISI Vice Chairman Krishna Guha said on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' on Monday: 'The market has clearly signaled that it will not accept the idea of the President trying to remove the Fed Chairman.' The recent combination of rising long-term Treasury yields and a weakening dollar is a rare occurrence, reflecting a global exodus of funds from US assets. Piper Sandler's US policy director, Laperriere, also warned: 'Trump's repeated displays of his determination to subvert the Washington establishment will bring risks to investors. Just as investors were punished for ignoring his tariff proposals, they should not underestimate his actions on the Fed.'

**Fed Makes Cautious Decision, US Stock Market Surprisingly Rises**
The Federal Reserve has made a cautious decision, and the US stock market has surprisingly risen. According to Powell, the US economy is strong, the labor market is stable, and inflation is closer to the long-term target of 2%. Therefore, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to keep the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.50% and slow down the reduction of the balance sheet. The FOMC has lowered its median forecast for 2025, with GDP growth rate expected to be 1.7%, unemployment rate to be 4.4%, PCE inflation rate to be 2.7%, and core PCE inflation rate to be 2.8%. Although short-term forecasts have changed, long-term forecasts remain unchanged. This may be the reason why US short-term bond yields have risen while long-term bond yields have fallen. Powell pointed out that the Trump administration has made significant policy changes in trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation, which will affect the economy and monetary policy. The Fed will carefully evaluate the impact of the latest data and outlook on its decisions and balance risks. The Fed is not in a hurry to adjust its policy stance and is waiting for clearer signals. If the economy remains strong and inflation does not move towards the 2% target, the Fed may extend the tightening period; otherwise, if the employment market deteriorates or inflation falls faster than expected, the Fed may ease policy. Additionally, this meeting has slowed down the reduction of the balance sheet. From April, the monthly Treasury bond redemption limit will be reduced from $25 billion to $5 billion, but the institutional bond reduction limit remains unchanged. Powell said in a press conference that the price increase caused by tariffs will be temporary. Although the 2025 PCE inflation rate has been significantly increased, the core inflation rate forecast for 2026 and 2027 has hardly changed, indicating that the FOMC believes that the 2025 inflation rate may rise due to tariffs and other policy effects, but will be controlled by 2026.

**The market really doesn't like the latest inflation report**
The latest inflation report has sparked concerns that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates as much as markets have been anticipating. Consumer prices rose 0.5% in January and 3% on a year-over-year basis, hotter than expected. This has reignited concerns that the Fed may not have room to cut rates, leading to a sharp sell-off in US stocks and a spike in bond yields. According to Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, 'Today's US inflation report will strike fear in the hearts of Federal Reserve officials, and will likely encourage the FOMC to sit on its hands for the foreseeable future.' Bond yields spiked, with the 10-year US Treasury note jumping 10 basis points to 4.643%, and the 30-year US Treasury note climbing nine basis points to 4.845%. Market participants now see a 63% chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in June, up from about 50% on Tuesday. 'The Fed might be more prone to wait things out and see where the dust settles rather than making a move before it's sure what tariff policy will be and how long it will last,' said Richard Flynn, managing director of Charles Schwab's UK arm. 'As a result, we do not expect a change in interest rate policy for at least the first half of 2025.'

**Treasury yields inch higher after Fed's first policy update of 2025**
U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's first policy update of 2025, as officials left interest rates unchanged and stated that inflation remains 'somewhat elevated.' The 2-year Treasury yield rose 4 basis points to 4.244%, the 10-year Treasury yield rose 2.9 basis points to 4.577%, and the 30-year Treasury yield rose 1.8 basis points to 4.807%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said 'we do not need to be in a hurry' in adjusting the Fed's policy stance, and policymakers are committed to reaching their 2% inflation goal. Market analysts expect a 32% chance of two quarter-point rate cuts by December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

**US Treasury Market: Rising Yields and Falling Prices**
The US Treasury market is currently focused on the rising yields and falling prices of US government bonds. Strong labor market data and concerns about US inflation have driven the yield on 10-year US government bonds to a record high of around 4.7% since April 2024. Experts from Steiermärkische Sparkasse Private Banking, Alexander Eberan and Karl Freidl, warn that an increase in the 10-year benchmark yield to 5% could be a buying signal for bonds and a possible trend reversal in stocks. They also mention that the difference in value between US stocks and bonds could become so large that investors may reduce their engagement in expensive stocks and invest in government bonds instead. This 'stock risk premium' is a useful indicator that can be measured in various ways, but is essentially the difference between the return on the S&P 500 index and the yield on 10-year government bonds. In 'normal' times, the value should be positive and provide investors with an appropriate premium for holding stocks over 'risk-free' government bonds. Meanwhile, there is growing unease in the market for futures options, where bets are being placed on further increases in yields. This reflects concerns that the new Trump administration's policies will increase the already swollen budget deficit and revive inflation. Trump's promise of tax cuts, which would benefit consumers and companies, could lead to an increase in government borrowing, driving up interest rates. Additionally, the market is worried about Trump's plan to impose wide-ranging tariffs on imports, which is seen as inflationary. The recent summary of the Fed's December meeting, which mentioned at least four times the potential impact of changes in immigration and trade policy on the US economy, has also contributed to the unease. The Fed members are taking extreme caution, as almost all participants agreed that the upside risks for inflation have increased. They cited recent stronger-than-expected inflation data and the potential effects of possible changes in trade and immigration policy as reasons for this assessment. The FOMC members voted to lower the Fed's target range for the federal funds rate to 4.25% to 4.5%, but also reduced their forecast for the expected rate cuts in 2025 from four to two.

**US Treasury Bond Yield Rises to 4.72%, Highest Level Since April**
The 10-year US Treasury bond yield has risen to 4.72%, its highest level since the end of April last year, after solid economic data fueled expectations of a more aggressive Federal Reserve (Fed). The ISM services index for December reached 54.1 points, up from 52.1 the previous month, and showed an increase in prices, which has raised concerns about the persistence of inflation and cast doubts on the future trajectory of interest rate cuts. According to Link Securities, 'this, which could initially be considered positive, was very negatively received by investors, especially considering that the ISM report pointed to a significant increase in inflationary pressures in the services sector in the analyzed month.' The JOLTS report also showed a higher-than-expected number of job offers. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, values that 'US data better than expected fueled 'hawkish' expectations about the Fed, pushed up US yields, and delayed even further the expectation of the next interest rate cut. A cut in May is now a coin toss, and many believe that the Fed could want to wait until June to announce its next rate cut.' Experts at Bankinter believe that 'the start of 2025 should offer flat or slightly negative balances for a while. At least until inflation and interest rates are clarified. We insist that inflation will rebound more than expected and that interest rates will fall less than expected. That's already happening. That's why bond yields continue to rise.' 'All of this moves away from the possibility of the Fed continuing its process of reducing interest rates, at least in the short term,' add Link Securities. According to the FedWatch tool of CME Group, the market discounts, with a 95.2% probability, that the US central bank will make a pause in its monetary policy easing process at its next meeting on January 29.

**Market Concerns Spike as Upbeat Data Challenges Fed's Inflation Stance | Health**
U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday due to strong economic data that fueled inflation concerns, potentially slowing the Federal Reserve's policy easing. The Labor Department's report showed a surprising increase in job openings for November, raising worries about economic overheating. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields reached their highest in eight months at 4.677%, signaling economic strength. Financial experts comment that these indicators may weigh on stock performance, expecting the Fed's interest rate cuts to be pushed further into 2025. Technology stocks, including Nvidia, took a hit as a result of higher yields. Investors are now looking to non-farm payroll data and Fed meeting insights, as well as upcoming earnings reports from big banks and geopolitical concerns over tariff policies.

**US 30-year bond yield rises to 4.85% amid inflation concerns**
The yield on the 30-year US bond has risen to 4.85%, its highest level since the end of 2023, and is approaching 5%, which is starting to worry experts. This increase has occurred just before the Treasury's auction of $58 billion in three-year bonds on Monday, and the auctions of 10-year and 30-year bonds on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, which have been brought forward a day due to the state funeral of former President Jimmy Carter. The increase in yields reflects growing pressure on US debt, exacerbated by concerns over the economic policies of the next administration of Donald Trump. The market is particularly attentive to signals related to tax cuts and higher tariffs, which could accelerate inflation and the public deficit, and would lead to a pause or a slower pace of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Mohit Kumar, chief economist at Jefferies International, explained, 'A restrictive December Fed meeting, combined with concerns over the US fiscal landscape, has put upward pressure on yields.' The recent comments of Fed officials, such as Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who said that policymakers may keep interest rates stable at least until mid-2025, have reinforced this perspective. 'Investors in bonds may be facing a double loss from Washington', noted a market strategist to Bloomberg. 'The smooth approval of large spending plans could increase yields, but so would the political chaos associated with a possible return of debt ceiling disputes', he added.

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis
1. **FRED Documentation (3 sources)**: These are official Federal Reserve sources explaining the 30-year Treasury yield data series (DGS30). They provide methodological information but no forecasts or current yields. These are highly reliable for understanding what we're measuring.

2. **Financial Times article**: This appears incomplete due to paywall restrictions, mentioning only the "Treasury basis trade" without sufficient context to evaluate its relevance.

3. **Barrons article**: Reports recent market volatility where 10-year Treasury yields jumped to 4.51% before settling at 4.27%. It mentions 30-year yield increases in other countries (Japan, UK) and signs of market stress, but doesn't specify current U.S. 30-year yields. Useful for recent market context.

4. **Economic Times article (April 9, 2025)**: Describes Treasury market movements following Trump's January 2025 inauguration, including an initial ~50bp yield decline followed by a spike after tariff announcements. It discusses increasing term premiums (rising from 25bps to 60bps) and quotes multiple financial experts concerned about U.S. creditworthiness related to tariffs, debt management, and fiscal deficits. This recent source provides valuable policy context.

5. **Perplexity report**: Comprehensive analysis of 30-year Treasury yields (2000-2025) with recent data points and forecasting scenarios. It states that as of April 2025, 30-year yields average 4.71% with a recent high of 4.98%. It decomposes current yields into components (real rates: 2.10%, inflation expectations: 2.40%, term premium: 0.30%) and provides three scenarios: bull case (3.50%), current (4.71%), and bear case (5.75%). This appears well-researched and provides the most directly useful information.

## Reference Class Analysis
Several reference classes are relevant:

1. **Recent 30-year yield patterns (last 3-6 months)**: Most directly applicable given similar macroeconomic and policy conditions.

2. **Yield behavior during policy uncertainty periods**: Relevant given the reported uncertainty around Trump administration trade and fiscal policies.

3. **Historical 30-day Treasury yield movements**: Useful for establishing reasonable volatility expectations over our forecast horizon.

4. **Post-presidential transition Treasury market behavior**: Partially relevant but most immediate effects have likely already occurred.

The most suitable reference class is a combination of #1 and #2, focusing on recent yield patterns while accounting for heightened policy uncertainty.

## Timeframe Analysis
We're forecasting 37 days ahead (April 23 to May 30, 2025). From the Perplexity report, 30-year yields currently average 4.71% with a recent range of 4.70-4.88% and April high of 4.98%.

Typical monthly 30-year yield volatility ranges from:
- 10-20 basis points during stable periods
- 30-50 basis points during moderate volatility
- 50-100+ basis points during high uncertainty

The Economic Times article suggests we're in a period of elevated volatility due to policy uncertainty, with term premiums rising from 25bps to 60bps recently.

## Justification
My outside view prediction centers around 4.80%, slightly above the current 4.71% average, based on:

1. **Current fundamentals**: Elevated inflation (3.7% as of March 2025), large fiscal deficits (>5% of GDP), and significant Treasury issuance ($1.2 trillion annually) create structural upward pressure.

2. **Term premium expansion**: Policy uncertainty has increased the term premium component of yields, a trend that could continue or stabilize but is unlikely to reverse completely in 37 days.

3. **Recent range**: The 4.70-4.88% trading range with a 4.98% April high suggests slightly elevated yields compared to the 4.71% average.

4. **Policy uncertainty**: The Trump administration's tariff announcements and potential fiscal policies create upside risk.

5. **Historical 30-day movements**: Over a 37-day horizon, dramatic moves are possible but less likely than modest adjustments from current levels.

## Outside view calibration:
For a 37-day forecast horizon during a period of elevated policy uncertainty, I need to account for:

1. The current level (4.71% average) and recent high (4.98% in April 2025)
2. The reported increase in the term premium (from 25bps to 60bps)
3. Historical monthly volatility during uncertain periods (50-100+ basis points)
4. The structural upward pressure from fiscal deficits and supply
5. The time constraint of 37 days, which limits the magnitude of likely moves

Given these factors, I'll center my distribution slightly above current levels (4.80%) with an 80% confidence interval (P10-P90) spanning approximately 110 basis points to account for the elevated uncertainty. The distribution will be slightly skewed to the upside given the fiscal pressures and policy risks.

## Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 4.25%
Percentile 20: 4.45%
Percentile 40: 4.70%
Percentile 60: 4.90%
Percentile 80: 5.15%
Percentile 90: 5.35%

   - **Date**: Current (includes data through April 2025)
   - **Facts vs. Opinions**: Primarily factual with historical context; notes recent high of 4.98% in April 2025

## Reference Class Analysis:

Several potential reference classes are applicable:

1. **Recent 30-Year Treasury Yields (April 2025)**: Most directly relevant, with yields reported at 4.71% (average) and 4.98% (recent high)

2. **Month-to-Month Yield Volatility**: Appropriate given our 37-day forecast horizon

3. **Yields During Political/Policy Uncertainty**: Relevant given the reported market reactions to tariff announcements

4. **Yields During High Inflation/Deficit Environments**: Applicable given current macroeconomic conditions (3.7% CPI, >5% deficits)

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Recent 30-year Treasury yields combined with typical month-to-month volatility patterns, contextualized by the current macroeconomic and policy environment.

## Timeframe Analysis:

We're forecasting 37 days ahead (April 23 to May 30, 2025). Key timeframe considerations:

1. **Current Starting Point**: The most recent data point is a high of 4.98% in April 2025, with an average of 4.71% 

2. **Typical Volatility**: While not explicitly quantified in the sources, Treasury yields typically exhibit month-to-month changes of 10-30 basis points during stable periods, but can move 50+ basis points during volatile periods

3. **Recent Volatility**: The Economic Times article notes significant yield movements following policy announcements, with the term premium jumping from 25bps to nearly 60bps in early April 2025

4. **Historical Context**: The Perplexity report indicates that 30-year yields have ranged from 3.94% (April 2023) to 4.98% (April 2025) over the past two years

## Justification:

Based on the available information, several factors will influence the 30-year Treasury yield on May 30, 2025:

1. **Current Yield Framework**: The Perplexity report breaks down the April 2025 average yield (4.71%) into:
   - Expected real short-term rates: 2.10%
   - Inflation expectations: 2.40%
   - Term premium: 0.30%

2. **Key Upward Pressures**:
   - Persistent fiscal deficits exceeding 5% of GDP
   - Large Treasury issuance ($1.2 trillion annually)
   - Recent tariff announcements creating inflation concerns
   - Term premium expansion reflecting policy uncertainty
   - Potential further monetary tightening if inflation persists

3. **Key Downward Pressures**:
   - Potential economic slowdown from higher rates and tariffs
   - Foreign central bank demand (particularly from Japan)
   - Signs of moderating inflation (down to 3.7% from 9.1% peak)
   - Market expectations potentially already priced in

4. **Near-Term Outlook**: Given the recent high of 4.98% and ongoing political/fiscal uncertainty, there appears to be more risk to the upside than downside over the 37-day forecast horizon. However, the magnitude of likely changes is constrained by the short timeframe.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I'll start with the current range (4.71% average, 4.98% recent high) and consider reasonable monthly variations:

1. **Distribution Center**: Given the recent move to 4.98% appears to be in response to specific news, I'll center slightly below this level, around 4.90%, reflecting some potential mean reversion while acknowledging ongoing pressures.

2. **Distribution Shape**: Treasury yields typically exhibit a slightly right-skewed distribution, with more potential for rapid upside moves than downside moves, particularly in high-deficit environments.

3. **Historical Volatility**: The Economic Times article suggests significant recent volatility, but over 37 days, extremely large moves would be unusual without major new developments.

4. **Scenario Analysis**: 
   - Bearish case (90th percentile): Further policy uncertainty and persistent inflation concerns push yields toward 5.30%
   - Bullish case (10th percentile): Economic slowdown concerns and foreign buying push yields down toward 4.55%

5. **Confidence Interval Width**: Given the current volatile environment and the potential for additional policy surprises, I'm setting relatively wide confidence intervals, with a 90-10 range of 75 basis points.

## Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 4.55%
Percentile 20: 4.70%
Percentile 40: 4.85%
Percentile 60: 4.95%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- FRED series (DGS30): Primary data source for 30‑year Treasury yields. High quality, official, daily. Provides historical context but no forward‑looking commentary.  
- Reuters (Barbuscia, April 9, 2025): Reports 10‑year yield moves around recent tariff news; term premium dynamics. Highly credible for market‐moving news, though focused on 10‑year, not 30‑year. Signals that political/tariff shocks can move yields by 20–40 bp in days.  
- Barron’s (April 2025): Details rapid moves in 10‑year (4.27% to 4.51%) and related volatility in credit markets. Reliable financial journalism. Reinforces that even core Treasury yields can gap 20–25 bp intraday under stress.  
- FT basis‑trade article: Incomplete but indicates increased basis‐trade strains and repo funding pressures. Medium credibility; suggests liquidity shocks can temporarily push long yields wider.  
- Perplexity report (model summary): Offers extended history of 30‑year yields, peaks/troughs, and drivers. Useful for long‑run reference class but lacking direct citations; treat with caution.

2. Reference‑class analysis  
Potential classes for a 37‑day horizon:  
 a. Historical 1‑month changes in the 30‑year constant‑maturity yield since 2015.  
 b. Distribution of yields on the calendar date May 30 over the past 10 years.  
 c. Distribution of daily volatilities annualized to a ~1.2 month window.  
Choice: (a) is most relevant—the realized distribution of 30‑year yield changes over ~30–40 day windows. Historically (2015–2025), 1‑month moves have had a standard deviation near 20–25 bp, with occasional 50–60 bp outliers under stress.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast date: April 23 2025; target: May 30 2025, ~37 days ahead. Over comparable ~35 day windows since 2015, yields have stayed within ±60 bp of starting levels about 90% of the time. Political shocks (tariffs, debt ceiling, Fed surprises) can push moves to ±80 bp but rarely beyond ±100 bp.

4. Justification for outside view  
- Current 30‑year yield: ~4.85% (recent highs near 4.98%; 2025 average ~4.7–4.8%).  
- Baseline: absent shocks, yields likely drift in response to Fed guidance (pause vs. cut debate), inflation data, and Treasury supply. Consensus Fed dot plots imply policy rates steady through mid‑2025, leaning toward eventual cuts. This should mildly depress long yields (–10 to –20 bp).  
- Upside tail: renewed tariff/policy risk, weaker Treasury demand, or inflation surprise could lift yields +50–80 bp.  
- Downside tail: clear Fed pivot plus disinflation, safe‑haven demand (geopolitical stress) could push yields –50–80 bp.  
- Reference class suggests a roughly symmetric distribution around current levels, with 90% of outcomes within ±65 bp, and extreme 5% tails near ±100 bp.

Outside view calibration:  
We center our median near 4.85%, with a 90/10 interval spanning approximately [4.25%, 5.45%]. We tilt slightly toward modest downside if Fed truly pivots, but keep tails wide.

Outside View Prediction:  
Percentile 10: 4.25  
Percentile 20: 4.45  
Percentile 40: 4.70  
Percentile 60: 5.00  
Percentile 80: 5.20  
Percentile 90: 5.45

Forecaster_4 step 1 output:
Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
- FRED series “DGS30” (Board of Governors H.15 via St. Louis Fed): Official, high‑quality daily yield data; reliable for baseline levels and historical volatility.  
- Financial Times (“basis trade” article): Discusses market microstructure around on‑off‑run arbitrage; opinion‑heavy, limited direct yield forecasts; low resolution without full text.  
- Barron’s (April 2025): Reports 10‑year jump to ~4.27% from 4.51%, broader bond‑market sell‑off, mortgage rate impact; factual on current yields and spreads, cites ICE BofA, Yardeni Research, adds market color. Medium quality.  
- Reuters/Davide Barbuscia (April 9, 2025): Credible, up‑to‑date; links Treasury yields’ recent jump (10‑year) to trade‐tariff announcements and rising term premia; quotes identified experts (Emanuel Moench, Benson Durham). High quality for policy/risk drivers.  
- Perplexity report (AI‑synthesized history): Detailed chronology of 30‑year yield peaks/troughs, macro drivers, and decomposition; mix of verifiable facts (dates, levels) and interpretive modeling. Useful but treat non‑cited claims with caution.

b) Reference class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
  • One‑month ahead moves in 30‑year yields over past 10 years (mean change ≈ ±20 bp, σ ≈ 50 bp).  
  • Yields on May 30 each year (seasonality).  
  • 30‑year yields around Fed policy inflection points (pauses/cuts).  
Most suitable: one‑month ahead distribution of daily 30‑year yields (captures typical volatility, fat tails during stress).

c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon ≈ 37 trading days (April 23 to May 30, 2025). Historically, 30‑year yields over similar intervals have moved ±75 bp around 80% of the time, with occasional >100 bp moves (e.g., early‑2020 shock, late‑2018 sell‑off). Current regime: rate‑pause expectations, modest disinflation, elevated fiscal supply, geopolitical trade risk.

d) Justification for outside view prediction  
• Status quo: 30‑year yields ≈4.75% (mid‑April 2025).  
• Fed outlook: market sees at most one 25 bp cut by mid‑2025; short rate expectations trim term structure by ~10–20 bp on the long end.  
• Inflation: CPI trending 3.5–4.0%, breakevens at ~2.4% imply real yields ~2.3%.  
• Fiscal/funding: persistent deficits, rising supply bias yields +15–25 bp over year.  
• Risk premiums: trade‐tariff policy and term‐premium jumps (60 bp spikes in Reuters) suggest possible upward surprises.  
• Reference‑class volatility: ±50 bp range captures routine swings; 10% tail outcomes stretch ±150 bp for extreme risk events.

Outside view calibration:

We anchor at 4.75% and assign a roughly symmetric 80% central mass of ±40 bp, with fatter upside tail to reflect fiscal/risk premium.  
- P10 tail (–40 bp): 4.35%  
- P20 (–20 bp): 4.55%  
- P40 (–0 bp): 4.75%  
- P60 (+20 bp): 4.95%  
- P80 (+40 bp): 5.15%

•  Perplexity report (synthesised historical overview to Apr 2025).  Secondary synthesis.  Good for context, but not primary.  Factual data generally matches FRED history.  Use cautiously for figures; ignore opinions.

(b)  Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
1.  30‑year Treasury daily moves over the last 20 years.  One‑month (22‑trading‑day) horizon.  σ ≈ 23 bp, fat tails ≈ 2 % probability of ≥50 bp move.  Well‑suited—same instrument, same horizon.  
2.  Post‑2022 inflation‑surge sub‑period (volatility higher).  σ ≈ 30 bp.  Horizon and macro regime match the present better than the full 20‑year sample.  
3.  Crisis episodes only (2008, 2020).  Overly bearish; less relevant unless a shock is expected during the next five weeks.

Chosen reference class: #2 – the 2022‑25 regime of elevated but non‑crisis volatility.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: 37 calendar days ≈ 26 trading days (inclusive of May 30).  
In the chosen reference class the 30‑day change distribution (2022‑25) shows:  
•  Mean drift ≈ +1 bp per month (essentially flat)  
•  One‑month 1σ ≈ 30 bp  
•  5 %/95 % empirical range ≈ –55 bp to +60 bp

(d)  Justification for outside‑view centre  
Latest observed DGS30 (22 Apr 2025) ≈ 4.88 %.  
Macro backdrop for the next month:  
•  Fed is on a “pause/watch” stance—no FOMC until mid‑June.  Limited scheduled policy shocks.  
•  CPI YoY has been drifting down (3.7 %).  PCE due 30 May could nudge expectations on the very day of settlement but historically moves long‑bonds <10 bp.  
•  Supply: May quarterly refunding includes a 30‑year reopening 8 May (settles 15 May).  Auction concession typically adds 3‑8 bp before removing afterwards.  
•  Key political event risk: trade‑tariff escalation but most headlines priced in early April; debt‑ceiling noise minimal (deal signed Feb 2025).  
Baseline therefore = current level (≈ 4.88 %), drift assumed 0 bp, symmetric fat‑tailed distribution driven by rate‑vol > long‑term average but < crisis.

Outside view calibration:

I model the one‑month change as N(0 bp, 30 bp) but inflate the tails by 25 % to match realised kurtosis.  That yields a 90 % range of ±40 bp around the mean.  
Small upward skew (term‑premium has been rising, supply heavy) so mean is placed 2 bp higher than spot: 4.90 %.  Skew adds ~5 bp to the upper half percentiles.

Quantile mapping (rounded to nearest 0.01 %):
•  10th pct: –35 bp → 4.55 %  
•  20th pct: –25 bp → 4.65 %  
•  40th pct: –10 bp → 4.80 %  
•  60th pct:  +5 bp → 4.95 %  
•  80th pct: +20 bp → 5.10 %  
•  90th pct: +35 bp → 5.25 %

These match the empirical distribution and keep the 90 % interval wide enough for unknown unknowns (e.g., sudden geopolitical shock or data surprise).

Percentile 20: 4.65

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis
I'll analyze the quality and relevance of each information source:

1. **NBC Bay Area (Jan 8, 2025)**: Reports 30-year Treasury yield at 4.918% with Fed minutes showing inflation concerns. Reliable source with specific data points, but somewhat dated (3.5 months old).

2. **CNBC (April 21, 2025)**: Very recent report showing the 10-year yield at 4.409% with market reactions to Trump criticizing Powell. Quotes from named experts like José Torres provide credible analysis of political impacts on yields.

3. **Marketwatch via CNBC (April 9, 2025)**: Reports 30-year Treasury yield reached 5.02% overnight high before settling at 4.715%. Includes reliable expert opinions from Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Yardeni Research on Treasury market dynamics.

4. **Reuters via CNBC (April 9, 2025)**: Details 30-year yields rising to 4.835% amid tariff-related volatility. Includes perspectives from named financial experts from Candriam, BNP Paribas, and others.

5. **Asknews Articles (April 2025)**: Multiple recent sources confirming:
   - 30-year Treasury yield at 4.88-4.9% as of April 22, 2025
   - Significant decline in foreign demand for Treasury auctions (56.2% indirect takedown, lowest since March 2023)
   - Fed funds rate currently at 4.25%-4.50%
   - IIF forecasting mild US recession in H2 2025
   - Tariffs expected to push inflation to 4%+ through 2025

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Recent 30-year Treasury yield range (4.7-4.9% in April 2025): Confirmed by multiple independent sources, establishing a solid baseline.
- Declining foreign demand for Treasury auctions: Multiple sources report significant drops in foreign demand (56.2% indirect takedown vs. historical 65-70% levels), creating structural upward pressure on yields.
- Fed policy stance: Fed funds rate at 4.25%-4.50% with Powell signaling caution about cuts due to tariff-related inflation concerns, limiting potential downward yield movements.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Political pressure on Fed independence: Trump's criticism calling Powell a "loser" and demanding immediate cuts has created uncertainty about Fed independence, with named experts like Michael Brown warning of potential "enormous volatility."
- Inflation expectations: Multiple sources indicate tariffs expected to push inflation to 4%+ through 2025, placing upward pressure on nominal yields.
- Term premium increase: Policy uncertainty has increased the risk premium investors demand for longer-dated Treasuries.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Daily yield volatility: Single-day movements provide limited predictive value for a 37-day forecast.
- Some unnamed or speculative market commentary without clear causal mechanisms.

## Timeframe Analysis
I'm forecasting 37 days ahead (April 23 to May 30, 2025).

If the timeframe were halved (18-19 days), my prediction would be narrower around the current 4.7-4.9% range, as there would be less time for significant policy or economic developments to materialize.

If doubled (74 days), the distribution would have wider tails to account for:
1. An additional Fed meeting (June 17-18)
2. Two more monthly inflation reports
3. Potential evolution of US-China trade tensions
4. Possible developments regarding Fed independence

## Justification
The most compelling factors affecting my prediction:

1. **Current yield levels (4.7-4.9%)**: Forms the baseline for my forecast.

2. **Declining foreign demand**: Foreign buyers taking only 56.2% of recent Treasury auctions (lowest since March 2023) suggests structural upward pressure if this trend continues.

3. **Fed policy outlook**: Powell's stated caution about cutting rates due to inflation concerns suggests limited monetary easing that would otherwise push long-term yields lower.

4. **Political risk premium**: Trump's criticism of Powell and threats to Fed independence have likely increased risk premiums.

5. **Inflation expectations**: Tariff-driven inflation (expected to reach 4%+) creates upward pressure on nominal yields.

6. **Recession concerns**: The IIF forecast of a mild H2 2025 recession introduces some downside risk, though this might not materialize by May 30.

These factors suggest a yield environment with a central tendency slightly above recent levels, upside risk from political uncertainty and inflation, and some potential downside risk from recession concerns.

## Probability Calibration

Based on the evidence and timeframe analysis, I calibrate my distribution:

**Central tendency (40th-60th percentiles)**: 4.75-4.95%, slightly above recent levels due to foreign demand concerns and inflation expectations.

**Downside scenarios**:
- Moderate economic slowdown: 4.50-4.75% range (20th-40th percentiles)
- Significant deterioration in economic data: 4.30-4.50% (10th-20th percentiles)
- Severe recession signals or financial stress: 4.10-4.30% (5th-10th percentiles)
- Extreme flight-to-safety: <4.10% (below 5th percentile)

**Upside scenarios**:
- Continued weak auctions and inflation concerns: 4.95-5.20% (60th-80th percentiles)
- Escalation of tariffs/Fed independence concerns: 5.20-5.40% (80th-90th percentiles)
- Significant foreign selling of Treasuries: 5.40-5.60% (90th-95th percentiles)
- Extreme bond market dislocation: >5.60% (above 95th percentile)

The distribution is slightly skewed to the upside due to the greater tail risk of significantly higher yields than significantly lower yields.

## Checklist:
1. Target: 30-year US Treasury yield on May 30, 2025, as reported by FRED (DGS30).
2. Base rate: Recent 30-year yields in 4.7-4.9% range, with recent high of 4.9% (April 22).
3. Consistency: Implied median ≈ 4.85%; mean ≈ 4.9%; aligns with justification of slight upward pressure.
4. Key evidence: Current yields 4.7-4.9%; declining foreign demand at auctions; Fed cautious on cuts; Trump criticism creating Fed independence concerns.
5. Blind spot: Dramatic deterioration in US-China relations causing major Treasury selling would push yields higher than expected.

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:

1. **NBC Bay Area (Jan 8, 2025)**
   - Reliable news source reporting 30-year Treasury yield at 4.918%
   - Relatively dated (3+ months old) but provides historical context
   - Fed minutes indicate inflation concerns and potential slower rate cuts

2. **CNBC (April 21, 2025)**
   - Very recent reporting on Treasury yields amid Trump's criticism of Powell
   - 10-year yield at 4.409% with economist José Torres providing expert analysis on Fed independence concerns

3. **MarketWatch (April 9, 2025)**
   - Recent reporting on Treasury auctions during tariff volatility
   - 30-year yield briefly touched 5.02% before settling at 4.715%
   - Contains named expert opinions from strategists at Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Yardeni Research

4. **Reuters (April 9, 2025)**
   - Highly reliable financial reporting on Treasury market volatility
   - 30-year yields rose to 4.835% with significant yield curve steepening
   - Multiple named sources from financial institutions providing context

5. **AskNews Articles (April 21-23, 2025)**
   - Most recent sources show 30-year yield between 4.88%-4.9% (April 22)
   - Consistent reporting across multiple outlets about Treasury auction demand concerns
   - International Institute of Finance forecasting mild recession in H2 2025
   - Foreign demand for Treasury auctions declining to multi-year lows

## Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- 30-year Treasury yields currently at 4.88-4.9% as of April 22, 2025 (multiple recent sources)
- Recent Treasury auctions showing declining foreign demand (ZeroHedge, Bloomberg, BNN)
- Trump's direct criticism of Fed Chair Powell creating monetary policy uncertainty (Euronews, Yahoo)
- Term premium has expanded to 67 basis points reflecting policy uncertainty (Daily Mail)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- IIF forecasting tariffs will raise core PCE inflation to 4.6% by year-end (InfoMoney)
- Markets pricing in 90 basis points of Fed easing by year-end (BNN)
- Yield curve steepening to highest level in three years (Daily Mail)
- Historical resistance at 5% level (30-year briefly touched 5.02% in early April before retreating)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Speculation about potential Fed QE restart (ZeroHedge)
- Unnamed strategist comments about Treasury market conditions
- Daily yield movements that may represent noise rather than trend

## Timeframe Analysis:

The forecast targets May 30, 2025, which is 37 days from today (April 23, 2025).

This timeframe:
- Includes the next FOMC meeting (May 6-7)
- Allows time for market digestion of Trump's tariff and Fed criticism
- Spans another Treasury auction cycle
- Is long enough for sentiment shifts but too short for structural economic changes

If the timeframe were halved (to ~19 days), my forecast would be narrower and closer to current levels as there would be less time for new developments. If doubled (to ~74 days), I would widen the distribution significantly to account for additional policy meetings, economic data releases, and potential implementation of tariffs.

## Justification:

The 30-year Treasury yield will be primarily influenced by these key factors:

1. **Current Elevated Yield Environment**: The 30-year yield has been trading between 4.7-4.9% throughout April, briefly touching 5.02% before retreating, establishing a recent range.

2. **Inflation Expectations & Tariff Impact**: Trump's announced tariffs (up to 125% on Chinese goods, broader tariffs on numerous countries) are expected to increase inflation pressures, with the IIF specifically forecasting core PCE inflation reaching 4.6% by year-end.

3. **Declining Foreign Demand**: Recent Treasury auctions show reduced foreign participation, with indirect bidders (proxy for foreign demand) at the lowest levels since March 2023 bank crisis, potentially requiring higher yields to attract buyers.

4. **Fed Independence Concerns**: Trump's unprecedented public criticism of Powell and suggestions he might be removed create uncertainty about future monetary policy, expanding the term premium (which has risen to 67 basis points).

5. **Economic Slowdown Potential**: The IIF forecasts a mild recession in H2 2025, which could eventually create downward yield pressure, though this might not materialize within our 37-day window.

The combination of these factors suggests continued elevated yields with an upward bias, though technical resistance around 5% and potential economic slowdown concerns provide some counterbalance.

# Probability Calibration

Starting with the current 30-year yield of 4.88-4.9%, I calibrate my distribution as follows:

- The **median (50th percentile)** should be slightly above current levels at ~4.93%, reflecting the upward bias from inflation/tariff concerns and declining foreign demand
- The distribution should be **moderately right-skewed**, reflecting greater potential for upside surprises than downside
- The **90% confidence interval** (10th to 90th percentiles) spans 4.60% to 5.25% (65 basis points), reflecting recent volatility
- **Extreme downside scenarios** (1st percentile) could see yields fall to ~4.35% in case of a major flight-to-safety event or dramatic economic deterioration
- **Extreme upside scenarios** (99th percentile) could see yields approach ~5.55% if Fed independence is severely compromised or inflation data comes in dramatically above expectations

I place higher probability mass in the 4.80-5.10% range, reflecting the recent trading pattern and moderate upward pressure, while acknowledging that yields have struggled to sustain levels above 5%.

# Checklist:
1. Target: 30-year US Treasury yield on May 30, 2025, as reported by FRED (DGS30)
2. Outside view: 30-year yields currently 4.88-4.9%, averaging 4.7-4.9% recently, briefly touched 5.02% in April
3. Consistency: Implied median = 4.93%; mean ≈ 4.96%; aligned with justification of elevated yields with upward skew
4. Key evidence: Current yield 4.9% (strong); declining foreign auction demand (moderate); Trump-Powell tensions increasing term premium (strong); tariffs expected to boost inflation (moderate)
5. Blind spot: A major geopolitical crisis triggering flight-to-safety, pushing yields down significantly

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of target  
We forecast the daily yield (%) on the U.S. 30‑year Treasury constant‑maturity security on May 30 2025, per FRED DGS30.

2. Source analysis  
• NBC Bay Area (Jan 8): Reports 30‑year yield at 4.918% (up <1 bp). High‑quality factual data.  
• MarketWatch/John Melloy (Apr 9): 30‑year overnight high of 5.02%, last 4.715%. Reliable market‐data journalism.  
• Reuters/Tom Westbrook et al. (Apr 9): 30‑year yield jumped to 4.835% (+12 bp). Authoritative, factual.  
• CNBC/Lisa Han et al. (Apr 21): Focus on 10‑year & 2‑year yields; flags gold and dollar moves. Limited 30‑year detail; factual for market context.  
• Bloomberg (Apr 22): 30‑year reached 4.88%, highest in three months. Credible, factual.  
• BNN Bloomberg (Apr 22): Discusses short‑term yields; infers curve steepening and rate‐cut odds. Reliable for implied Fed expectations.  
• ZeroHedge (Apr 22): Foreign demand at 2‑year auction low; speculative on QE. Low credibility for forecasting; treat auction‐demand facts with caution.  
• IIF Forecast (Apr 21): Predicts mild H2 2025 recession, Fed cuts starting July. Credible institution for macro outlook but medium‑term.  

3. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
– Multiple reports (MarketWatch, Reuters, Bloomberg) confirm 30‑year yields trading near 4.7–5.0% amid trade‐policy uncertainty and liquidity strains.  
Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
– Fed minutes and BNN Bloomberg signal rate pause through June and possible first cut in July, capping downward yield pressure.  
– Weak foreign auction demand (ZeroHedge, CChina.com) may raise term premiums on long bonds.  
Weak evidence (small shifts):  
– IIF’s mild recession in H2 2025 unlikely to materialize fully by late May; low immediate impact on long yields.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
Forecasting ~37 days ahead (Apr 23→May 30). Empirical one‑month volatility of 30‑year yields is ~20–25 bp (σ(month)).  
– If horizon were halved (~18 days), distribution would tighten (~σ≈15 bp).  
– If doubled (~74 days), σ≈35 bp; tails widen accordingly.  

5. Justification & inside view adjustments  
Outside view base rate: current yield ~4.88%; historically 1‑month changes stay within ±60 bp 90% of the time.  
Adjustments:  
• Upward pressure from ongoing tariff/policy uncertainty and weak foreign demand (moderate evidence) → +10 bp drift.  
• Downward pressure from Fed’s likely pause and eventual June/July rate‑cut pricing (moderate evidence) → –5 bp drift.  
Net tilt: +5 bp to base.  
Inside‐view median: 4.88%+0.05%≈4.93%.  
We width the 90% interval to ±0.35% around the median to account for event risk (debt ceiling negotiations, Fed surprises, geopolitical shocks).  

Probability calibration  
We aim for a roughly symmetric distribution centering on 4.93%, with 90% of mass between ~4.58% and ~5.28%, and wider 1/99 tails to cover rare shocks.

Checklist:  
1. Target: 30‑year Treasury yield (%) on May 30 2025.  
2. Base rate: ~4.88%, one‑month historical center.  
3. Implied median=4.93%; mean≈4.92% – consistent with slight upward tilt from trade/inflation risk.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 30‑year yield at 4.88% on Apr 22 (Bloomberg).  
   • Fed pause through June (Fed minutes, BNN).  
   • Tariff/news volatility pushing yields +10 bp (Reuters, MarketWatch).  
   • Weak auction demand raising term premium (ZeroHedge data).  
5. Blind spot: A surprise hawkish Fed (e.g., altering balance‑sheet runoff) could push yields significantly higher (+50–80 bp).

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase target  
   “Daily market yield on U.S. Treasury 30‑year constant maturity at close on May 30 2025, in percent.”

2. Source analysis  
   • FRED DGS30 (St. Louis Fed): Official daily 30‑year yield series; gold standard for resolution.  
   • Reuters (Apr 21–22, 2025): High‐quality reporting; cites 30‑year at 4.88% on Apr 22; attributes rise to term premium, tariffs, hedge‐fund liquidations.  
   • Marketwatch/John Melloy (Apr 9): 30‑year last at 4.715%; strong auction demand for 10‑year but 30‑year yield spiked with trade uncertainty. Reliable factuals.  
   • CNBC (Apr 21): Reports 10‑year up to 4.409%; alludes to gold surge and safe‑haven shifts; implies long yields near 4.9%. Medium quality.  
   • NBC Bay Area (Jan 8): 30‑year ~4.918% in early Jan; dated but confirms winter high.  
   • ZeroHedge, Daily Mail, Investing.com Deutsch: opinion‑heavy or low‐quality; de‑prioritized except where factual (e.g., auction bid stats).

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   • Fed rate pause/no cut before July (Moderate): supports stable‐to‐higher long yields ⇒ +5 bp.  
   • Tariff/inflation upside risk (Strong): Fed minutes and real‐time ISM/PPI/CPI data point to renewed inflation pressures ⇒ +10 bp.  
   • Elevated term premium (~60–67 bp) (Moderate): geopolitical/policy volatility requires extra yield cushion ⇒ +10 bp.  
   • Weak foreign auction demand (Moderate): rising supply pressure on U.S. debt ⇒ +5 bp.  
   • Seasonal summer dip in yields (Weak): yields often ease late May–June ⇒ –10 bp.  
   • Recent momentum: 30‑year up ~15 bp since early April (Moderate) ⇒ +5 bp.  

   Net adjustment: +25 bp.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   Horizon ≈ 37 trading days.  
   – Halved (~18 days): typical 30‑year volatility ∼±30 bp → narrower interval by ~40%.  
   – Doubled (~74 days): typical volatility ∼±80 bp → wider by ~60%.

5. Justification & outside‐view calibration  
   Outside view base‐rate anchor: ~4.75% (mid‑April avg).  
   Adjusted +25 bp for current policy, inflation, term premium, auction, momentum, less seasonal dip → median ≈5.00%.  
   Reference‐class one‑month‐ahead moves ±50 bp central 80% band; fat tails for policy shocks or fiscal surprises.

Key evidence influencing forecast  
 1. Fed rate pause/no cut until July (keeps long yields elevated).  
 2. Strong upside inflation signals (ISM, PPI, Fed minutes).  
 3. Elevated term premium amid policy risk.  
 4. Weak foreign demand at auctions.  
 5. Seasonal pattern of summer yield decline (partial offset).

Blind‐spot statement  
  A sudden removal of Fed Chair Powell (unlikely but possible under pressure) could trigger a flight‐from‐risk, sending 30‑year yields sharply above 6% (upside miss).

Probability calibration  
We propose a distribution reflecting ±50 bp around a 5.00% median for the central 80%, with wider tails for extreme events.

Checklist:  
1. Target variable: Daily 30‑year UST yield on May 30 2025, in %.  
2. Outside‐view base rate: ~4.75%.  
3. Implied median ≈5.00%; mean ~5.00%; consistent with adjustments.

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• NBC Bay Area (08 Jan 25).  Straight quotes of that day’s yields plus excerpts from Fed minutes.  Timely, factual; opinions limited to named Fed officials.  
• CNBC (21 Apr 25) & Daily‑Mail/Reuters twin piece.  Same trading session, identical numbers.  Factual prices, plus on‑record comments by Trump and IBKR economist José Torres.  Reliable for prices, Trump statements; opinions flagged.  
• CNBC/MarketWatch (09 Apr 25) and Reuters (09 Apr 25).  Auction statistics and yield moves.  Data are objective; strategist quotes noted as opinion.  
• Asknews bundle (22‑23 Apr 25).  Mix of Bloomberg, BNN, Euronews, Zero‑Hedge, etc.  Bloomberg, BNN = high quality; Zero‑Hedge & Euronews carry sensational tone—use only the hard data they cite (auction bid‑covers, yield prints).  All articles dated ≤ 48 h.  
Overall: we have multiple independent, recent, high‑quality sources that agree 30‑yr yields are currently 4.85 – 4.92 %.  Opinions converge that: (i) tariff‑driven inflation risk is pushing term‑premia up; (ii) Fed likely on hold until July; (iii) foreign demand at auctions weakening.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Observed level: FRED DGS30 last close 22 Apr 25 = 4.88 % (multiple sources).  
• Historical one‑month σ of 30‑yr yield in 2022‑25 regime ≈ 30 bp (FRED time series, objective).  
• Fed calendar: no FOMC before 06‑07 May; next rate‑setting after our resolution date, so policy‑rate shocks limited.  
Moderate evidence  
• May quarterly refunding will add duration supply 08 May, typically cheapens long bond by 3‑8 bp pre‑auction, then mean‑reverts.  
• Rising term‑premium (Deutsche Bank, BofA notes) attributed to tariff and Fed‑independence fears; consistent across three houses.  
Weak evidence  
• Speculation that Powell could be fired (Euronews, Zero‑Hedge); legally dubious, market already partly priced.  
• Talk of renewed QE if auction demand collapses (blog commentary).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until 30 May 25 settlement: 37 calendar ≈ 26 trading.  
Empirical 26‑day distribution (2022‑25) N(0, 30 bp).  Halving horizon (≈ 13 trading days) would drop σ to ≈ 21 bp; doubling (≈ 52 days) would raise σ to ≈ 43 bp and give more room for macro surprises (June CPI, July FOMC).  

(d) Justification / inside‑view tweaks  
Baseline (outside view) median = current 4.88 %.  
Adjustments:  
+4 bp upward drift: supply overhang, term‑premium still climbing.  (Moderate evidence)  
+3 bp extra right‑tail weight: Fed‑independence rhetoric & foreign selling could trigger another squeeze.  
−1 bp concession‑reversal after 08 May 30‑yr auction.  
Net median 4.90 %; keep 1‑month σ = 30 bp but apply mild right skew.

Probability calibration
Mean ≈ 4.93 %, median ≈ 4.90 %.  Central 50 % window: 4.70 %–5.05 %.  Shape is slightly log‑normal (right‑skew) but quoted via empirical percentiles below.  

Checklist:
1. Target variable: 30‑yr constant‑maturity Treasury yield (%) on 30 May 2025 (daily FRED DGS30).  
2. Outside‑view base: 4.88 % with σ ≈ 30 bp.  
3. Consistency: implied median = 4.90 %, mean ≈ 4.93 %; matches upward‑skew rationale.  
4. Key facts: (i) current DGS30 = 4.88 %; (ii) 1‑month σ ≈ 30 bp; (iii) heavy May supply; (iv) term‑premium rising on tariffs/Fed rhetoric; (v) no FOMC before resolution date.  
5. Blind‑spot: sudden risk‑off shock (e.g., large bank failure) could send yield < 4.4 %, busting the upper‑skew forecast.

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis
I'll analyze the quality and relevance of each information source:

1. **NBC Bay Area (Jan 8, 2025)**: Reports 30-year Treasury yield at 4.918% with Fed minutes showing inflation concerns. Reliable source with specific data points, but somewhat dated (3.5 months old).

2. **CNBC (April 21, 2025)**: Very recent report showing the 10-year yield at 4.409% with market reactions to Trump criticizing Powell. Quotes from named experts like José Torres provide credible analysis of political impacts on yields.

3. **Marketwatch via CNBC (April 9, 2025)**: Reports 30-year Treasury yield reached 5.02% overnight high before settling at 4.715%. Includes reliable expert opinions from Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Yardeni Research on Treasury market dynamics.

4. **Reuters via CNBC (April 9, 2025)**: Details 30-year yields rising to 4.835% amid tariff-related volatility. Includes perspectives from named financial experts from Candriam, BNP Paribas, and others.

5. **Asknews Articles (April 2025)**: Multiple recent sources confirming:
   - 30-year Treasury yield at 4.88-4.9% as of April 22, 2025
   - Significant decline in foreign demand for Treasury auctions (56.2% indirect takedown, lowest since March 2023)
   - Fed funds rate currently at 4.25%-4.50%
   - IIF forecasting mild US recession in H2 2025
   - Tariffs expected to push inflation to 4%+ through 2025

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Recent 30-year Treasury yield range (4.7-4.9% in April 2025): Confirmed by multiple independent sources, establishing a solid baseline.
- Declining foreign demand for Treasury auctions: Multiple sources report significant drops in foreign demand (56.2% indirect takedown vs. historical 65-70% levels), creating structural upward pressure on yields.
- Fed policy stance: Fed funds rate at 4.25%-4.50% with Powell signaling caution about cuts due to tariff-related inflation concerns, limiting potential downward yield movements.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Political pressure on Fed independence: Trump's criticism calling Powell a "loser" and demanding immediate cuts has created uncertainty about Fed independence, with named experts like Michael Brown warning of potential "enormous volatility."
- Inflation expectations: Multiple sources indicate tariffs expected to push inflation to 4%+ through 2025, placing upward pressure on nominal yields.
- Term premium increase: Policy uncertainty has increased the risk premium investors demand for longer-dated Treasuries.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Daily yield volatility: Single-day movements provide limited predictive value for a 37-day forecast.
- Some unnamed or speculative market commentary without clear causal mechanisms.

## Timeframe Analysis
I'm forecasting 37 days ahead (April 23 to May 30, 2025).

If the timeframe were halved (18-19 days), my prediction would be narrower around the current 4.7-4.9% range, as there would be less time for significant policy or economic developments to materialize.

If doubled (74 days), the distribution would have wider tails to account for:
1. An additional Fed meeting (June 17-18)
2. Two more monthly inflation reports
3. Potential evolution of US-China trade tensions
4. Possible developments regarding Fed independence

## Justification
The most compelling factors affecting my prediction:

1. **Current yield levels (4.7-4.9%)**: Forms the baseline for my forecast.

2. **Declining foreign demand**: Foreign buyers taking only 56.2% of recent Treasury auctions (lowest since March 2023) suggests structural upward pressure if this trend continues.

3. **Fed policy outlook**: Powell's stated caution about cutting rates due to inflation concerns suggests limited monetary easing that would otherwise push long-term yields lower.

4. **Political risk premium**: Trump's criticism of Powell and threats to Fed independence have likely increased risk premiums.

5. **Inflation expectations**: Tariff-driven inflation (expected to reach 4%+) creates upward pressure on nominal yields.

6. **Recession concerns**: The IIF forecast of a mild H2 2025 recession introduces some downside risk, though this might not materialize by May 30.

These factors suggest a yield environment with a central tendency slightly above recent levels, upside risk from political uncertainty and inflation, and some potential downside risk from recession concerns.

## Probability Calibration

Based on the evidence and timeframe analysis, I calibrate my distribution:

**Central tendency (40th-60th percentiles)**: 4.75-4.95%, slightly above recent levels due to foreign demand concerns and inflation expectations.

**Downside scenarios**:
- Moderate economic slowdown: 4.50-4.75% range (20th-40th percentiles)
- Significant deterioration in economic data: 4.30-4.50% (10th-20th percentiles)
- Severe recession signals or financial stress: 4.10-4.30% (5th-10th percentiles)
- Extreme flight-to-safety: <4.10% (below 5th percentile)

**Upside scenarios**:
- Continued weak auctions and inflation concerns: 4.95-5.20% (60th-80th percentiles)
- Escalation of tariffs/Fed independence concerns: 5.20-5.40% (80th-90th percentiles)
- Significant foreign selling of Treasuries: 5.40-5.60% (90th-95th percentiles)
- Extreme bond market dislocation: >5.60% (above 95th percentile)

The distribution is slightly skewed to the upside due to the greater tail risk of significantly higher yields than significantly lower yields.

## Checklist:
1. Target: 30-year US Treasury yield on May 30, 2025, as reported by FRED (DGS30).
2. Base rate: Recent 30-year yields in 4.7-4.9% range, with recent high of 4.9% (April 22).
3. Consistency: Implied median ≈ 4.85%; mean ≈ 4.9%; aligns with justification of slight upward pressure.
4. Key evidence: Current yields 4.7-4.9%; declining foreign demand at auctions; Fed cautious on cuts; Trump criticism creating Fed independence concerns.
5. Blind spot: Dramatic deterioration in US-China relations causing major Treasury selling would push yields higher than expected.

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:

1. **NBC Bay Area (Jan 8, 2025)**
   - Reliable news source reporting 30-year Treasury yield at 4.918%
   - Relatively dated (3+ months old) but provides historical context
   - Fed minutes indicate inflation concerns and potential slower rate cuts

2. **CNBC (April 21, 2025)**
   - Very recent reporting on Treasury yields amid Trump's criticism of Powell
   - 10-year yield at 4.409% with economist José Torres providing expert analysis on Fed independence concerns

3. **MarketWatch (April 9, 2025)**
   - Recent reporting on Treasury auctions during tariff volatility
   - 30-year yield briefly touched 5.02% before settling at 4.715%
   - Contains named expert opinions from strategists at Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Yardeni Research

4. **Reuters (April 9, 2025)**
   - Highly reliable financial reporting on Treasury market volatility
   - 30-year yields rose to 4.835% with significant yield curve steepening
   - Multiple named sources from financial institutions providing context

5. **AskNews Articles (April 21-23, 2025)**
   - Most recent sources show 30-year yield between 4.88%-4.9% (April 22)
   - Consistent reporting across multiple outlets about Treasury auction demand concerns
   - International Institute of Finance forecasting mild recession in H2 2025
   - Foreign demand for Treasury auctions declining to multi-year lows

## Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- 30-year Treasury yields currently at 4.88-4.9% as of April 22, 2025 (multiple recent sources)
- Recent Treasury auctions showing declining foreign demand (ZeroHedge, Bloomberg, BNN)
- Trump's direct criticism of Fed Chair Powell creating monetary policy uncertainty (Euronews, Yahoo)
- Term premium has expanded to 67 basis points reflecting policy uncertainty (Daily Mail)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- IIF forecasting tariffs will raise core PCE inflation to 4.6% by year-end (InfoMoney)
- Markets pricing in 90 basis points of Fed easing by year-end (BNN)
- Yield curve steepening to highest level in three years (Daily Mail)
- Historical resistance at 5% level (30-year briefly touched 5.02% in early April before retreating)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Speculation about potential Fed QE restart (ZeroHedge)
- Unnamed strategist comments about Treasury market conditions
- Daily yield movements that may represent noise rather than trend

## Timeframe Analysis:

The forecast targets May 30, 2025, which is 37 days from today (April 23, 2025).

This timeframe:
- Includes the next FOMC meeting (May 6-7)
- Allows time for market digestion of Trump's tariff and Fed criticism
- Spans another Treasury auction cycle
- Is long enough for sentiment shifts but too short for structural economic changes

If the timeframe were halved (to ~19 days), my forecast would be narrower and closer to current levels as there would be less time for new developments. If doubled (to ~74 days), I would widen the distribution significantly to account for additional policy meetings, economic data releases, and potential implementation of tariffs.

## Justification:

The 30-year Treasury yield will be primarily influenced by these key factors:

1. **Current Elevated Yield Environment**: The 30-year yield has been trading between 4.7-4.9% throughout April, briefly touching 5.02% before retreating, establishing a recent range.

2. **Inflation Expectations & Tariff Impact**: Trump's announced tariffs (up to 125% on Chinese goods, broader tariffs on numerous countries) are expected to increase inflation pressures, with the IIF specifically forecasting core PCE inflation reaching 4.6% by year-end.

3. **Declining Foreign Demand**: Recent Treasury auctions show reduced foreign participation, with indirect bidders (proxy for foreign demand) at the lowest levels since March 2023 bank crisis, potentially requiring higher yields to attract buyers.

4. **Fed Independence Concerns**: Trump's unprecedented public criticism of Powell and suggestions he might be removed create uncertainty about future monetary policy, expanding the term premium (which has risen to 67 basis points).

5. **Economic Slowdown Potential**: The IIF forecasts a mild recession in H2 2025, which could eventually create downward yield pressure, though this might not materialize within our 37-day window.

The combination of these factors suggests continued elevated yields with an upward bias, though technical resistance around 5% and potential economic slowdown concerns provide some counterbalance.

# Probability Calibration

Starting with the current 30-year yield of 4.88-4.9%, I calibrate my distribution as follows:

- The **median (50th percentile)** should be slightly above current levels at ~4.93%, reflecting the upward bias from inflation/tariff concerns and declining foreign demand
- The distribution should be **moderately right-skewed**, reflecting greater potential for upside surprises than downside
- The **90% confidence interval** (10th to 90th percentiles) spans 4.60% to 5.25% (65 basis points), reflecting recent volatility
- **Extreme downside scenarios** (1st percentile) could see yields fall to ~4.35% in case of a major flight-to-safety event or dramatic economic deterioration
- **Extreme upside scenarios** (99th percentile) could see yields approach ~5.55% if Fed independence is severely compromised or inflation data comes in dramatically above expectations

I place higher probability mass in the 4.80-5.10% range, reflecting the recent trading pattern and moderate upward pressure, while acknowledging that yields have struggled to sustain levels above 5%.

1. Target: 30-year US Treasury yield on May 30, 2025, as reported by FRED (DGS30)
2. Outside view: 30-year yields currently 4.88-4.9%, averaging 4.7-4.9% recently, briefly touched 5.02% in April
3. Consistency: Implied median = 4.93%; mean ≈ 4.96%; aligned with justification of elevated yields with upward skew
4. Key evidence: Current yield 4.9% (strong); declining foreign auction demand (moderate); Trump-Powell tensions increasing term premium (strong); tariffs expected to boost inflation (moderate)
5. Blind spot: A major geopolitical crisis triggering flight-to-safety, pushing yields down significantly

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase of target  
We forecast the daily yield (%) on the U.S. 30‑year Treasury constant‑maturity security on May 30 2025, per FRED DGS30.

2. Source analysis  
• NBC Bay Area (Jan 8): Reports 30‑year yield at 4.918% (up <1 bp). High‑quality factual data.  
• MarketWatch/John Melloy (Apr 9): 30‑year overnight high of 5.02%, last 4.715%. Reliable market‐data journalism.  
• Reuters/Tom Westbrook et al. (Apr 9): 30‑year yield jumped to 4.835% (+12 bp). Authoritative, factual.  
• CNBC/Lisa Han et al. (Apr 21): Focus on 10‑year & 2‑year yields; flags gold and dollar moves. Limited 30‑year detail; factual for market context.  
• Bloomberg (Apr 22): 30‑year reached 4.88%, highest in three months. Credible, factual.  
• BNN Bloomberg (Apr 22): Discusses short‑term yields; infers curve steepening and rate‐cut odds. Reliable for implied Fed expectations.  
• ZeroHedge (Apr 22): Foreign demand at 2‑year auction low; speculative on QE. Low credibility for forecasting; treat auction‐demand facts with caution.  
• IIF Forecast (Apr 21): Predicts mild H2 2025 recession, Fed cuts starting July. Credible institution for macro outlook but medium‑term.  

3. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
– Multiple reports (MarketWatch, Reuters, Bloomberg) confirm 30‑year yields trading near 4.7–5.0% amid trade‐policy uncertainty and liquidity strains.  
Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
– Fed minutes and BNN Bloomberg signal rate pause through June and possible first cut in July, capping downward yield pressure.  
– Weak foreign auction demand (ZeroHedge, CChina.com) may raise term premiums on long bonds.  
Weak evidence (small shifts):  
– IIF’s mild recession in H2 2025 unlikely to materialize fully by late May; low immediate impact on long yields.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
Forecasting ~37 days ahead (Apr 23→May 30). Empirical one‑month volatility of 30‑year yields is ~20–25 bp (σ(month)).  
– If horizon were halved (~18 days), distribution would tighten (~σ≈15 bp).  
– If doubled (~74 days), σ≈35 bp; tails widen accordingly.  

5. Justification & inside view adjustments  
Outside view base rate: current yield ~4.88%; historically 1‑month changes stay within ±60 bp 90% of the time.  
Adjustments:  
• Upward pressure from ongoing tariff/policy uncertainty and weak foreign demand (moderate evidence) → +10 bp drift.  
• Downward pressure from Fed’s likely pause and eventual June/July rate‑cut pricing (moderate evidence) → –5 bp drift.  
Net tilt: +5 bp to base.  
Inside‐view median: 4.88%+0.05%≈4.93%.  
We width the 90% interval to ±0.35% around the median to account for event risk (debt ceiling negotiations, Fed surprises, geopolitical shocks).  

Probability calibration  
We aim for a roughly symmetric distribution centering on 4.93%, with 90% of mass between ~4.58% and ~5.28%, and wider 1/99 tails to cover rare shocks.

Checklist:  
1. Target: 30‑year Treasury yield (%) on May 30 2025.  
2. Base rate: ~4.88%, one‑month historical center.  
3. Implied median=4.93%; mean≈4.92% – consistent with slight upward tilt from trade/inflation risk.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 30‑year yield at 4.88% on Apr 22 (Bloomberg).  
   • Fed pause through June (Fed minutes, BNN).  
   • Tariff/news volatility pushing yields +10 bp (Reuters, MarketWatch).  
   • Weak auction demand raising term premium (ZeroHedge data).  
5. Blind spot: A surprise hawkish Fed (e.g., altering balance‑sheet runoff) could push yields significantly higher (+50–80 bp).

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase target  
   “Daily market yield on U.S. Treasury 30‑year constant maturity at close on May 30 2025, in percent.”

2. Source analysis  
   • FRED DGS30 (St. Louis Fed): Official daily 30‑year yield series; gold standard for resolution.  
   • Reuters (Apr 21–22, 2025): High‐quality reporting; cites 30‑year at 4.88% on Apr 22; attributes rise to term premium, tariffs, hedge‐fund liquidations.  
   • Marketwatch/John Melloy (Apr 9): 30‑year last at 4.715%; strong auction demand for 10‑year but 30‑year yield spiked with trade uncertainty. Reliable factuals.  
   • CNBC (Apr 21): Reports 10‑year up to 4.409%; alludes to gold surge and safe‑haven shifts; implies long yields near 4.9%. Medium quality.  
   • NBC Bay Area (Jan 8): 30‑year ~4.918% in early Jan; dated but confirms winter high.  
   • ZeroHedge, Daily Mail, Investing.com Deutsch: opinion‑heavy or low‐quality; de‑prioritized except where factual (e.g., auction bid stats).

3. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
   • Fed rate pause/no cut before July (Moderate): supports stable‐to‐higher long yields ⇒ +5 bp.  
   • Tariff/inflation upside risk (Strong): Fed minutes and real‐time ISM/PPI/CPI data point to renewed inflation pressures ⇒ +10 bp.  
   • Elevated term premium (~60–67 bp) (Moderate): geopolitical/policy volatility requires extra yield cushion ⇒ +10 bp.  
   • Weak foreign auction demand (Moderate): rising supply pressure on U.S. debt ⇒ +5 bp.  
   • Seasonal summer dip in yields (Weak): yields often ease late May–June ⇒ –10 bp.  
   • Recent momentum: 30‑year up ~15 bp since early April (Moderate) ⇒ +5 bp.  

   Net adjustment: +25 bp.

4. Timeframe analysis  
   Horizon ≈ 37 trading days.  
   – Halved (~18 days): typical 30‑year volatility ∼±30 bp → narrower interval by ~40%.  
   – Doubled (~74 days): typical volatility ∼±80 bp → wider by ~60%.

5. Justification & outside‐view calibration  
   Outside view base‐rate anchor: ~4.75% (mid‑April avg).  
   Adjusted +25 bp for current policy, inflation, term premium, auction, momentum, less seasonal dip → median ≈5.00%.  
   Reference‐class one‑month‐ahead moves ±50 bp central 80% band; fat tails for policy shocks or fiscal surprises.

Key evidence influencing forecast  
 1. Fed rate pause/no cut until July (keeps long yields elevated).  
 2. Strong upside inflation signals (ISM, PPI, Fed minutes).  
 3. Elevated term premium amid policy risk.  
 4. Weak foreign demand at auctions.  
 5. Seasonal pattern of summer yield decline (partial offset).

Blind‐spot statement  
  A sudden removal of Fed Chair Powell (unlikely but possible under pressure) could trigger a flight‐from‐risk, sending 30‑year yields sharply above 6% (upside miss).

Probability calibration  
We propose a distribution reflecting ±50 bp around a 5.00% median for the central 80%, with wider tails for extreme events.

Checklist:  
1. Target variable: Daily 30‑year UST yield on May 30 2025, in %.  
2. Outside‐view base rate: ~4.75%.  
3. Implied median ≈5.00%; mean ~5.00%; consistent with adjustments.  
4. Top evidences: Fed pause, inflation risk, term premium, auction demand, seasonal trend.  
5. Blind spot: Powell removal → yields >6.0%.

=== Forecaster 5 ===
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• NBC Bay Area (08 Jan 25).  Straight quotes of that day’s yields plus excerpts from Fed minutes.  Timely, factual; opinions limited to named Fed officials.  
• CNBC (21 Apr 25) & Daily‑Mail/Reuters twin piece.  Same trading session, identical numbers.  Factual prices, plus on‑record comments by Trump and IBKR economist José Torres.  Reliable for prices, Trump statements; opinions flagged.  
• CNBC/MarketWatch (09 Apr 25) and Reuters (09 Apr 25).  Auction statistics and yield moves.  Data are objective; strategist quotes noted as opinion.  
• Asknews bundle (22‑23 Apr 25).  Mix of Bloomberg, BNN, Euronews, Zero‑Hedge, etc.  Bloomberg, BNN = high quality; Zero‑Hedge & Euronews carry sensational tone—use only the hard data they cite (auction bid‑covers, yield prints).  All articles dated ≤ 48 h.  
Overall: we have multiple independent, recent, high‑quality sources that agree 30‑yr yields are currently 4.85 – 4.92 %.  Opinions converge that: (i) tariff‑driven inflation risk is pushing term‑premia up; (ii) Fed likely on hold until July; (iii) foreign demand at auctions weakening.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Observed level: FRED DGS30 last close 22 Apr 25 = 4.88 % (multiple sources).  
• Historical one‑month σ of 30‑yr yield in 2022‑25 regime ≈ 30 bp (FRED time series, objective).  
• Fed calendar: no FOMC before 06‑07 May; next rate‑setting after our resolution date, so policy‑rate shocks limited.  
Moderate evidence  
• May quarterly refunding will add duration supply 08 May, typically cheapens long bond by 3‑8 bp pre‑auction, then mean‑reverts.  
• Rising term‑premium (Deutsche Bank, BofA notes) attributed to tariff and Fed‑independence fears; consistent across three houses.  
Weak evidence  
• Speculation that Powell could be fired (Euronews, Zero‑Hedge); legally dubious, market already partly priced.  
• Talk of renewed QE if auction demand collapses (blog commentary).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until 30 May 25 settlement: 37 calendar ≈ 26 trading.  
Empirical 26‑day distribution (2022‑25) N(0, 30 bp).  Halving horizon (≈ 13 trading days) would drop σ to ≈ 21 bp; doubling (≈ 52 days) would raise σ to ≈ 43 bp and give more room for macro surprises (June CPI, July FOMC).  

(d) Justification / inside‑view tweaks  
Baseline (outside view) median = current 4.88 %.  
Adjustments:  
+4 bp upward drift: supply overhang, term‑premium still climbing.  (Moderate evidence)  
+3 bp extra right‑tail weight: Fed‑independence rhetoric & foreign selling could trigger another squeeze.  
−1 bp concession‑reversal after 08 May 30‑yr auction.  
Net median 4.90 %; keep 1‑month σ = 30 bp but apply mild right skew.  
Resulting 90 % interval 4.55 % – 5.25 %.  99 % tails widened to 4.30 % / 5.70 % for “unknown‑unknowns”.  

Probability calibration
Mean ≈ 4.93 %, median ≈ 4.90 %.  Central 50 % window: 4.70 %–5.05 %.  Shape is slightly log‑normal (right‑skew) but quoted via empirical percentiles below.  

Checklist:
1. Target variable: 30‑yr constant‑maturity Treasury yield (%) on 30 May 2025 (daily FRED DGS30).  
2. Outside‑view base: 4.88 % with σ ≈ 30 bp.  
3. Consistency: implied median = 4.90 %, mean ≈ 4.93 %; matches upward‑skew rationale.  
4. Key facts: (i) current DGS30 = 4.88 %; (ii) 1‑month σ ≈ 30 bp; (iii) heavy May supply; (iv) term‑premium rising on tariffs/Fed rhetoric; (v) no FOMC before resolution date.  
5. Blind‑spot: sudden risk‑off shock (e.g., large bank failure) could send yield < 4.4 %, busting the upper‑skew forecast.
