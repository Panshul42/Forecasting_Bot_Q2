According to MNI Markets (Tom Lake), the latest Morning Consult approval‐rating data show that over the past month:

• Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has seen his popularity slip, largely attributed to his government’s response to the “freedom convoy” protests in Ottawa.  
• Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s approval rating plunged by 7% amid a surge in COVID-19 cases.  
• German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s rating fell to 40% as his government was criticized for not taking a harder line on Russian aggression in Ukraine.  
• Among major global leaders, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains at the bottom of the approval rankings, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to hold the highest approval rating.

Here’s a concise summary of the North Jersey Media Group article on President Trump’s job approval as of early May 2025:

Facts & statistics  
• Early‐term context: Trump’s second term began amid mass firings, high egg prices and the Ukraine-Russia standoff; approval hit its low point in late April 2025 but has risen steadily since.  
• May 1 polls:  
  – Rasmussen Reports: 52% approve, 47% disapprove  
  – Economist/YouGov: 45% favorable, 53% unfavorable  
  – Morning Consult: 46% approve, 52% disapprove  
  – Quantus Insights: 48.2% approve, 48.3% disapprove, 3.5% no opinion  
    • Quantus also asked midterm vote intention: 45.2% would vote Democrat, 44.8% Republican, 10% undecided  
• May 13 RealClearPolitics average (14 pollsters): 45.9% approve, 50.2% disapprove  

Named sources & statements  
• White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted recent wins – a China tariff deal, return of hostage Edan Alexander, and a Middle East trip “to focus on strengthening ties.”  
• CNN data analyst Harry Enten on a “do-over” 2024 vote:  
  – Only 2% of Trump voters would switch to Harris, 1% regret voting at all  
  – Harris voters showed similarly minimal change  
  – Enten: “If there is some idea out there that Trump voters are going, ‘Man, I wish I would have voted for Kamala Harris… the numbers say that… doesn’t exist.”  

Caveat: Polls vary by methodology and timing; these figures reflect snapshots as of early to mid-May 2025.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the Morning Consult Pro article “Most Voters Say Donald Trump Is Responsible For the Economy.”

Key facts and figures  
1. 53% of U.S. registered voters now say current economic conditions are mostly the result of President Trump’s policies.  
   – Up from 46% in March 2025 and 39% in February 2025 (Morning Consult tracking).  
2. Trump’s net approval rating on handling the economy has fallen by 18 percentage points over this same period.  
3. Republicans in Congress once held a double-digit advantage over Democrats in voters’ trust to manage the economy; that advantage has now evaporated.  

Named sources and context  
– All figures come from a Morning Consult national survey of U.S. voters, reported in January 2025.  
– The article interprets the loss of a congressional Republican trust advantage as mirroring Trump’s falling economic approval.  

Analyst commentary (from the article)  
– For opponents of tariffs, the inability of Trump and congressional Republicans to distance themselves from the state of the economy represents a potential leverage point, especially as Trump continues to attribute economic conditions to his predecessor.

# Historical Analysis of Morning Consult Approval Ratings for Canadian Prime Ministers and U.S. Presidents

Approval ratings serve as a critical barometer of political leadership effectiveness and public sentiment. This report synthesizes historical data from Morning Consult and supplementary sources to compare the approval trajectories of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Key findings include Trudeau’s precipitous decline from a peak of over 60% approval in 2015 to a historic low of 22% by 2025, contrasted against the relative stability of Trump’s ratings and Biden’s sharp post-2021 downturn. Notably, Trudeau’s approval briefly surpassed that of contemporaneous U.S. leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic, though his later ratings fell below those of Trump’s second-term numbers. Economic pressures, policy controversies, and leadership fatigue emerge as consistent drivers of these trends.

Here are the key points from the Economic Times article “Canada elections 2025 predictions: PM Mark Carney is winning, show polls.”

1. Carney’s economic warning  
• Speaking in Charlottetown, PEI, Carney argued that Canada must “reduce its financial reliance on the US” because “Trump’s statements expose the necessity for economic reconstruction.”  
• He called for a “resilient government” and a “strategic plan” to handle external threats and negotiate effectively with the US.

2. Liberal spending and deficits  
• The Liberal Party proposes C$130 billion in additional public spending over the next four years.  
• The 2025–26 federal deficit is now forecast at C$62.3 billion, up from a December projection of C$42.2 billion.  
• According to “Carney’s staff,” these infrastructure investments are “fundamental” to tackling multi-year problems like housing and broader economic challenges.

3. Leadership change and political backdrop  
• Mark Carney succeeded Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier in 2025, ending nearly ten years of Trudeau’s premiership.  
• The leadership change has been linked to public concern over inflation, housing shortages, and immigration issues under Trudeau.

4. Polling data (Nanos Research)  
• Survey period: April 17–20, 2025  
• Sample size: 1,289 respondents; margin of error ±2.7 percent (19 times out of 20)  
• Voting intention: Liberals 43.7 percent, Conservatives 36.3 percent, NDP 10.7 percent  
• Analysts interpret this as pointing to a Liberal majority of over 343 seats in the House of Commons.

5. Expert commentary on early voting  
• Ipsos Public Affairs CEO Darrell Bricker noted that a surge in advanced voting “might show the success of ballot-push efforts beyond voter passion levels.”  
• Some analysts remain divided on how much early-voting increases predict overall turnout or party performance.

FAQs excerpted from the article:  
• Carney seeks a strong mandate to counter “Donald Trump’s tariff threats” and rebuild Canada’s economy for “long-term resilience.”  
• The Liberal economic plan centers on C$130 billion in new spending over four years and a larger deficit to address housing and economic issues.

Here’s a concise distillation of the key points from the CNN Politics article by Kevin Liptak (May 6, 2025) on President Trump’s Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney:

• Meeting context  
  – Date & setting: Midday May 6 meeting in the Oval Office.  
  – Tone: Neither outright hostile nor warmly neighborly—“relatively mild” by recent Trump standards.

• Speaking share  
  – Trump spoke ~95% of the time on topics ranging from the Middle East to California high-speed rail.  
  – Carney interjected sparingly (about 5% of the time).

• Border comment & pushback  
  – Trump: joked the U.S.–Canada border “was drawn…with, like, a ruler…that’s the way it was meant to be.”  
  – Carney (to reporters): “I’m glad that you couldn’t tell what was going through my mind.”  

• Canada-as-51st-state exchange  
  – Trump floated making Canada the 51st U.S. state.  
  – Carney: “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale…Canada…won’t be for sale ever.”  
  – Trump responded “that’s true,” then later “never say never,” to which Carney silently mouthed “never.”

• Assertion of sovereignty  
  – Carney reminded Trump Canada’s head of state is King Charles III—a message delivered before arriving in Washington.  
  – Objective: underscore that Canadian sovereignty “wasn’t up for debate.”

• Follow-up & future meetings  
  – Agreed to reconvene at the G7 summit in Alberta next month (Trump had not previously committed to attend).  
  – Carney told reporters he’d urged Trump that talking of annexation wasn’t “useful,” but “he is the president…and he will say what he wants.”

• Side notes & aftermath  
  – Trump on Truth Social: accused Canada of “need[ing] EVERYTHING from us,” though “we don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship.”  
  – Trump declined to revive his “Governor Carney” jab used on Justin Trudeau.  
  – Meeting ended abruptly: Trump reiterated tariffs on Canadian steel and autos would stay in place.

Here is a concise summary of the BBC’s April 29, 2025, profile of Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney:

Facts and career highlights  
•    Election and background  
    – Sworn in as prime minister in March 2025 after winning a snap federal election on April 28, 2025.  
    – First person without prior elected office to lead Canada’s Liberal Party; succeeded Justin Trudeau.  
•    Early life and education  
    – Born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories; holds Canadian and Irish citizenship (intends to relinquish Irish and British citizenships).  
    – Attended Harvard on scholarship (played ice hockey); earned a DPhil in economics from Oxford in 1995 (thesis on domestic competition and national competitiveness).  
•    Central-banking career  
    – Bank of Canada: deputy governor (2003), senior associate deputy minister at Finance Canada, governor (2007–2013).  
    – Credited with steering Canada through the 2008 financial crisis by cutting interest rates and keeping them low for at least a year to support investment.  
    – Bank of England governor (2013–March 2020): modernized the institution by reducing rate-setting meetings from 12 to 8 per year, publishing minutes alongside rate decisions, and introducing “forward guidance” (pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%).  
    – Chair, Financial Stability Board (2011–2018), coordinating global regulatory responses during and after the first Trump presidency.  
•    Notable interventions  
    – Warned in 2014 that an independent Scotland might lose pound-use privileges.  
    – Before the 2016 Brexit vote, cautioned that leaving the EU could trigger a recession; oversaw contingency plans and emergency monetary easing after the leave vote.  
    – During the initial Covid-19 shock (March 2020), cut Bank of England rates by 0.5% and promised the downturn would be “temporary.”  

Key statements and opinions  
•    On confronting Donald Trump’s “ridiculous, insulting” remarks about annexing Canada, Carney likened them to “the Voldemort of comments” (direct quote).  
•    He has vowed to maintain counter-tariffs “until the Americans show us respect … and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade.”  
•    Meg Meyer, his former Oxford doctoral supervisor, praised him as “extraordinarily versatile” and adept at mastering new challenges—qualities she said would serve Canada well in turbulent times.  
•    Conservative critics allege Carney misrepresented his role in Brookfield Asset Management’s decision to shift its headquarters from Toronto to New York and have pressed him to disclose his financial holdings. (These allegations come from political opponents and remain contested; Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust.)  

Policy interests and personal notes  
•    Reputation as a crisis manager and negotiator—traits he emphasized during the Liberal leadership race, pitching himself as best equipped to stand up to Trump.  
•    Known advocate for environmental sustainability; served as a UN special envoy for climate change in 2019 and launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in 2021.

Summary of “Mission: Impossible? How Mark Carney rescued Liberals in Canada after Trudeau’s collapse and Trump’s threats” (The Times of India, Apr 30, 2025):

1. Context and Leadership Change  
• By early 2025, Justin Trudeau’s approval had plunged amid high food prices, a housing crisis and ethics scandals.  
• January 2025: Trudeau resigns; Liberals install Mark Carney (former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England) as leader and Prime Minister.  
• Carney’s technocratic reputation and emphasis on stability immediately narrowed polls that had shown Liberals trailing Conservatives by 20 points.

2. External Catalyst: Trump’s Interventions  
• U.S. President Donald Trump, in his second term, imposed tariffs on Canadian goods and suggested Canada should become the “51st state.”  
• These moves sparked cross-party outrage and refocused the campaign on national sovereignty.  
• Carney campaigned on defending Canada, promising retaliatory measures and coining slogans like “Never 51!”  
• Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, previously aligned with populist critiques of Trudeau, struggled to distance himself from Trump-style rhetoric.

3. Election Outcome (2025 Federal Election)  
• Vote count: Liberals won 168 of 343 seats; Conservatives 143; remainder split among Bloc Québécois, NDP and Greens.  
• Liberals fell three seats short of a majority but celebrated a “moral victory” given their mid-campaign deficit.  
• Voter turnout was notably high, with record advance votes.  
• Analysts attribute the result to three factors:  
  – Trump’s interventions galvanizing patriotism  
  – Strategic voting by progressives shifting from NDP/Greens to Liberals  
  – Carney’s rebranding of the Liberals as competent defenders of sovereignty

4. Regional Patterns  
• Atlantic provinces: near-total Liberal sweep.  
• Quebec: Bloc Québécois collapsed as federalists coalesced around Liberals.  
• Ontario (GTA, Ottawa suburbs): strong Liberal performance driven by strategic progressive votes.  
• Manitoba and British Columbia: mixed, but Liberals held urban centres; Conservatives won most rural seats.  
• Alberta and Saskatchewan: remained Conservative strongholds.  
• Northern Territories: all seats won by Liberals.

5. Conservative Shortcomings  
• Trump’s actions reframed the ballot question from domestic policy to national independence.  
• Poilievre’s late denunciation of Trump (“stay out of our election”) came too late to reshape perceptions.  
• Removal of Trudeau eliminated Conservatives’ strongest personal attack line.  
• Progressive strategic voting further eroded Conservative prospects.

6. Collapse of Smaller Parties (partial)  
• NDP under Jagmeet Singh suffered major losses; Singh failed to retain his own seat.  
• Both Bloc Québécois and Greens also saw setbacks (details truncated).

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **MNI Markets (Tom Lake)**
   - Summarizes Morning Consult approval ratings showing declining popularity for several global leaders (Trudeau, Kishida, Scholz)
   - Factual reporting on polling data with limited analysis
   - No information on Trump or Mark Carney

2. **Reddit Posts (r/CanadaPolitics & r/FiveThirtyEight)**
   - First post shows Trudeau at 34% approval/60% disapproval (date unclear)
   - Second post shows Trudeau at 26% approval/67% disapproval (more recent)
   - Both reference Morning Consult data but are secondary sources with limited context
   - No information on Mark Carney

3. **North Jersey Media Group Article**
   - Detailed reporting on Trump's approval ratings as of May 2025
   - Multiple polling sources cited, including Morning Consult (46% approve/52% disapprove)
   - RealClearPolitics average: 45.9% approve/50.2% disapprove
   - Contains factual information with limited interpretation beyond White House spokesperson's comments

4. **Morning Consult Pro Analysis**
   - Primary source directly from polling company relevant to our question
   - Reports economic attribution to Trump increasing (53% of voters)
   - Notes Trump's economic approval has fallen 18 points (timeframe unclear)
   - Doesn't provide general approval figures

5. **Kitsap Sun Article**
   - Consistent with other sources on Trump's approval
   - Morning Consult (May 9-11, 2025): 46% approve/52% disapprove
   - Various other polls show similar numbers (41-46% approval)
   - Washington state approval lower than national average

6. **Perplexity Report (Incomplete)**
   - References Trudeau's decline from 60%+ approval to 22% low over his tenure
   - Mentions that Trudeau's approval briefly exceeded US leaders during COVID
   - Currently states that Trudeau's ratings are below Trump's second-term numbers
   - Unable to evaluate full quality as report is truncated

**Key Missing Information:**
- No data on Mark Carney's current approval rating
- No information on when/how Carney became Prime Minister
- Limited information on approval rating trends for Canadian PMs vs. US Presidents

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Possible reference classes:

1. **Historical Canadian PM vs. US President approval ratings**
   - The incomplete Perplexity report suggests Canadian PMs can sometimes outpoll US Presidents
   - Suggests Trudeau previously had higher approval than US counterparts during COVID
   - Useful but limited by lack of comprehensive data

2. **New leaders vs. established incumbents**
   - If Carney is newly appointed/elected, he might benefit from a "honeymoon period"
   - Trump is in second term, typically associated with approval stabilization
   - Potentially relevant but hampered by lack of information on Carney's status

3. **Approval ratings during economic pressure periods**
   - Sources indicate economic attribution affecting Trump's approval
   - Unknown how economic conditions are affecting Carney's approval
   - Insufficient information to apply effectively

**Most suitable reference class:** Historical Canadian PM vs. US President approval patterns, with consideration of potential honeymoon effects if Carney is newly appointed. This allows us to consider both historical patterns and leadership tenure.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

- Prediction timeframe: May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025 (approximately 6-7 weeks)
- Trump's approval appears relatively stable (mid-40s) based on multiple polls
- Trudeau's approval declined significantly over his tenure, reaching historical lows
- 6-7 weeks is typically insufficient time for major approval rating shifts absent significant events

## (d) Justification:

1. **Current Standing:**
   - Trump's approval is consistently measured around 45-46% by Morning Consult
   - No information on Carney's current approval, creating significant uncertainty
   - Trudeau's final approval ratings were very low (26%) suggesting possible Canadian voter dissatisfaction with his party/policies

2. **Incumbency Effects:**
   - Trump is in his second term, typically associated with more stable approval ratings
   - If Carney recently replaced Trudeau, he might benefit from a honeymoon effect or voter desire for change
   - Without knowing when Carney took office, it's difficult to assess this factor properly

3. **Historical Patterns:**
   - Canadian PMs can sometimes have higher approval than US Presidents
   - However, recent trend showed Trudeau's approval falling below Trump's second-term numbers
   - Canadian Liberal party appears to have faced declining popularity

4. **Economic Factors:**
   - Sources indicate Trump's economic approval has declined
   - Economic factors often significantly influence overall approval
   - No information on how economic conditions are affecting Carney's approval

# Outside view calibration:

Given the significant information gaps regarding Mark Carney's current approval rating and when he became Prime Minister, I must rely heavily on the limited data available:

1. Trump's current approval is ~46% according to Morning Consult
2. The previous Canadian PM (Trudeau) had very low approval (26%)
3. Canadian Liberal party approval appears to have been declining

Without knowing Carney's current approval or tenure length, I need to consider:
- If Carney is new, he might benefit from a honeymoon period boosting approval
- If Carney represents a significant break from Trudeau, he might have higher approval
- Trump's approval appears relatively stable in the mid-40s range

The base rate (without specific information about Carney) suggests Trump is more likely to have higher approval ratings, but there's substantial uncertainty due to the potential for Carney to be experiencing a honeymoon period or representing a significant change from the unpopular Trudeau.

# Outside View Prediction:
32% probability that Mark Carney will have a higher approval rating than Donald Trump on July 1, 2025.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **MNI Markets report on global approval ratings**:
   - Factual reporting on recent approval trends for global leaders
   - Shows several leaders experiencing declining approval ratings
   - No specific numbers for Trudeau or Trump, limiting direct relevance
   - Credible market intelligence source

2. **Reddit posts (r/CanadaPolitics and r/FiveThirtyEight)**:
   - Report Trudeau's approval at 34% (first post) and 26% (second post)
   - Limited contextual information and posting dates
   - Simply reference Morning Consult data without analysis
   - Low-medium reliability as primary sources

3. **North Jersey Media Group article (May 13, 2025)**:
   - Comprehensive polling data from multiple sources
   - Morning Consult shows Trump at 46% approve, 52% disapprove
   - Includes expert context from White House press secretary and CNN analyst
   - Medium-high reliability with multiple cited polls

4. **Morning Consult Pro analysis**:
   - Original source specified in resolution criteria
   - Focuses on economic approval rather than overall approval
   - Shows Trump's economic approval declining
   - High reliability as the specified resolution source

5. **Kitsap Sun article (May 13, 2025)**:
   - Corroborates North Jersey data
   - Morning Consult (May 9-11): Trump at 46% approve, 52% disapprove
   - Includes additional polling context and expert opinion
   - Medium-high reliability with properly cited sources

6. **Perplexity report (incomplete)**:
   - Attempts to analyze historical approval patterns but cuts off
   - Mentions Trudeau's decline from 60%+ approval to 22% by 2025
   - Limited utility due to incompleteness

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several reference classes are relevant:

1. **New leader "honeymoon periods"**: 
   - Most relevant reference class
   - New leaders typically experience temporary popularity boosts
   - Especially relevant as Carney would be replacing historically unpopular Trudeau

2. **Former financial/technocratic leaders entering politics**:
   - Somewhat relevant given Carney's background as former Bank of Canada/England governor
   - Limited data available on this specific transition

3. **Canada-US leader approval comparison**:
   - Directly relevant to the question
   - Limited specific data in provided sources

4. **Leadership transitions following unpopular incumbents**:
   - Highly relevant given Trudeau's poor ratings
   - Suggests potential for significant rebound effect

Most suitable reference class is a combination of "new leader honeymoon effect" and "transitions following unpopular incumbents," as these directly address Carney's likely situation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction timeframe is short - from May 15, 2025, to July 1, 2025 (47 days). Key timeframe considerations:

1. We don't know exactly when Carney will become PM, but it will be before July 1, 2025
2. If recently appointed, Carney would likely still be in his honeymoon period
3. The shorter the time between Carney's appointment and July 1, the stronger the honeymoon effect
4. Trump's approval has been relatively stable at mid-40s with some fluctuation
5. 47 days is typically not long enough for dramatic approval shifts absent major events

## (d) Justification:

The key factors for this prediction:

1. **Current standing**: Trump has 46% approval per Morning Consult (May 9-11, 2025)
2. **Trudeau's poor performance**: Current Canadian PM has approximately 26% approval
3. **Leadership transition**: Mark Carney is not yet PM but will become PM before July 1
4. **Potential honeymoon effect**: New leaders typically receive a 10-15 point approval boost
5. **Rebound from unpopular predecessor**: Transitions from unpopular leaders often see larger than normal boosts
6. **Carney's background**: As a former central banker, he brings a different profile than career politicians
7. **Gap to overcome**: Carney would need to exceed Trump's 46% approval

For Carney to have higher approval than Trump on July 1, he would need to:
- Overcome the 20-point gap between Trudeau (26%) and Trump (46%)
- Benefit substantially from both the honeymoon effect and the "anyone but Trudeau" sentiment
- See minimal decline in the honeymoon boost by July 1
- Not face any early significant controversies

The circumstances of Carney's ascension (which we don't know) would also significantly impact his initial approval.

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my forecast, I need to consider:

1. **Baseline gap**: Current gap is approximately 20 percentage points (46% Trump vs. 26% Trudeau)

2. **Honeymoon effect**: New leaders typically see a 10-15 point boost in their first few months. Applied to Trudeau's baseline, this would put Carney at roughly 36-41%.

3. **Unpopular predecessor bonus**: Given Trudeau's extreme unpopularity, there could be an additional 5-10 point boost simply from the change in leadership.

4. **Volatility in Trump's numbers**: Trump's approval could shift by several points in either direction over the next 47 days.

Combining these factors, Carney could reasonably achieve an approval rating in the range of 36-51% by July 1. The upper end would exceed Trump's current 46%, while the lower end would not.

Given the significant gap to overcome (20 points) balanced against the potential for a substantial honeymoon+change bonus (15-25 points), and considering the short timeframe, I estimate approximately a 38% chance that Carney's approval will exceed Trump's on July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- MNI Markets (Tom Lake): Reports Trudeau at 34% approval. Reliable financial‐markets correspondent citing Morning Consult. Factual.  
- Reddit r/CanadaPolitics: Reiterates Trudeau 34% approve, 60% disapprove. Direct extract from Morning Consult. Low added value but factual.  
- Reddit r/FiveThirtyEight: Cites Trudeau at 26% approve, 67% disapprove (no date given). Contradicts the 34% figure; likely an older week’s average or smaller sample. Treat as lower‐confidence.  
- North Jersey Media Group: Aggregates 4 May polls for Trump: Morning Consult 46/52, Rasmussen 52/47, Economist/YouGov 45/53, Quantus 48.2/48.3. RealClearPolitics average ~45.9/50.2. High quality, multiple reputable sources.  
- Morning Consult Pro (“Most Voters Say Trump Is Responsible…”): Shows growing economic blame on Trump; net economic approval down 18 points since Feb 2025. Signals downward pull on overall approval. Methodology reliable.  
- Kitsap Sun (USA Today): Lists multiple U.S. approval figures mid‐May: ~44–46% approve vs. ~52% disapprove. Consistent with North Jersey data.  
- Perplexity report (model‐generated): Summarized historical Trudeau vs. U.S. presidents (Trump/Biden). Likely a mix of facts and model inference. Use cautiously for broad peaks/troughs.

2. Reference‐class analysis  
Possible classes:  
  a. Weekly probability that a Canadian PM’s Morning Consult approval exceeds U.S. president’s.  
  b. Initial approval boosts of new prime ministers vs. sitting U.S. presidents.  
  c. Cross‐national approval gaps among comparable Western democracies.  

Class (a) is simplest: measure fraction of weeks since 2017 where Trudeau’s MC approval > Trump’s MC approval. Public data suggest Trudeau briefly exceeded Trump in early COVID (2020 peak ~60% vs. Trump ~45%) but mostly has been below. For the period Nov 2016–Jan 2021, Trudeau above ~20% of weeks. Since Jan 2021 vs. Biden, even rarer. So baseline ~15–25%. Carney isn’t Trudeau, but initial boost of a fresh leader may add 5–10 points. Use 20% as reference‐class base.

3. Timeframe analysis  
47 days until July 1, 2025. Approval ratings evolve slowly absent shocks. Trump’s average mid‐May is ~45%; trending +/-2 points into early summer. A new Canadian PM often enters with ~50–55% approval (honeymoon), then drops by ~1–2 points/month. Over 1.5 months, Carney could fall from perhaps 55% to ~51%. Trump could drift slightly upward if the Gulf trip and economy stories pay off (+1–2 points) or downward if economy blame intensifies (-1–2 points). Net: Carney ~50–53 vs. Trump ~44–48.

4. Justification for outside view  
- Historical: Trudeau rarely beat Trump; only during crisis peaks.  
- New‐PM boost: Carney may start at a 55% Midmorning Consult rating (analogy: Trudeau 2015 started ~60%; others around 50).  
- Momentum: Carney’s technocrat brand may sustain >50% into July. Trump’s economy approval still underwater in mid-40s; may inch up modestly but unlikely to surpass low-50s by July.  
- Net effect: Carney’s first‐term honeymoon likely eclipses Trump’s midterm average. Still, approval drift and unforeseen crises could erode Carney’s lead.  

Outside view calibration:  
Reference class (a) gives ~20% baseline that a Canadian PM tops the U.S. president. Add a +10 pp uplift for new‐leader honeymoon. Subtract ~5 pp for risk of early crises and Trump’s modest summer bump. That yields ~25 pp. Given uncertainty (±5 pp), round to 25%.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 25% probability that, on July 1, 2025, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Morning Consult approval rating exceeds that of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
  a. MNI Markets (Tom Lake article)  
     – Data: Morning Consult global tracker shows Canadian PM Justin Trudeau at 34% approval, UK Johnson at bottom, Modi highest.  
     – Quality: Professional news service; draws on Morning Consult data. Low opinion content; factual.  
  b. Reddit r/CanadaPolitics post  
     – Data: Trudeau approve 34%, disapprove 60% (Morning Consult).  
     – Quality: Secondary link; no analysis, but cites a reliable survey. Treat as factual.  
  c. Reddit r/FiveThirtyEight post  
     – Data: Trudeau approve 26%, disapprove 67% (via Canadian Polling).  
     – Quality: Informal, missing context; use cautiously. Gives a lower bound for Trudeau.  
  d. NorthJersey Media Group (May 13)  
     – Data: Trump approval:  
         • Rasmussen 52% approve; Economist/YouGov 45%; Morning Consult 46%; Quantus 48.2%  
         • RCP average ~45.9% approve, 50.2% disapprove  
     – Quality: Aggregates multiple polls; credible.  
  e. Morning Consult Pro “Most Voters Say Trump Is Responsible for the Economy”  
     – Data: 53% of voters blame Trump for economy; net econ approval down 18 points.  
     – Quality: Primary source; survey details provided. Relevant for trend direction.  
  f. Kitsap Sun (via USA TODAY)  
     – Data: May polls all cluster 43–46% approve, 52% disapprove for Trump.  
     – Quality: Solid, multiple poll sources.  
  g. Perplexity report (synthesizing historical Morning Consult data)  
     – Data: Trudeau peaked >60% in 2015, fell to 22% by 2025; briefly exceeded U.S. leaders during COVID.  
     – Quality: Likely accurate but machine‐generated; verify key numbers. Useful for historical range.

2. Reference‐class analysis  
   Possible reference classes:  
   – Head‐to‐head approval comparisons of Canadian PM vs. U.S. President at contemporaneous points (e.g., Trudeau vs. Trump/Biden).  
   – Approval‐rating spreads for newly installed Canadian PMs vs. incumbent U.S. presidents.  
   – Within‐country approval changes over 1–2 months.  
   Suitability: The first class is directly analogous. Historically, Trudeau briefly outpaced Trump/Biden only under exceptional circumstances (early COVID). In normal times, the U.S. president’s approval tends to be higher or roughly parity.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Horizon: ~1.5 months (May 15 to July 1, 2025).  
   – Historical 6–8 week shifts: Trump’s approval moved ±3–5 points around events; Trudeau’s moved ±5–7 points. Unless extreme crisis or surge, unlikely >10-point swing. Carney, as a hypothetical PM, would start with minimal recognition, so initial approval likely below Trudeau’s baseline (~30%).  

4. Justification / Baseline (outside view)  
   – Current midpoint approvals: Canadian PM (substitute Trudeau) ~30% (range 26–34%); Trump ~45% (range 43–52%).  
   – Historical head-to-head: Canadian PM exceeded U.S. president only in the first COVID wave (2020) when Trump sharply fell. In normal times, U.S. president leads by ~10–15 points.  
   – As Carney is new, his approval likely starts ≤Trudeau’s current 30%, possibly lower due to unfamiliarity. Trump’s rating is relatively stable mid-40s and would require a sudden collapse (<30%) for Carney to overtake. A >15-point relative swing in 6 weeks is historically rare without a major crisis.  

Outside view calibration:  
  – Base‐rate probability of a Canadian PM approval exceeding that of a sitting Republican U.S. president in normal times is very low (historical frequency ~5% or less).  
  – Account for some chance of an unexpected Trump slump (e.g., foreign policy fiasco) or Carney honeymoon bump, but both would need to be extreme.  
  – Anchor to prior instances: In 1 major case (Spring 2020), Trudeau beat Trump—>1/20 roughly. But that was under extreme pandemic conditions. Under ordinary conditions, closer to 1/40.

   - Quality: Moderate (contextual political information but secondary source)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
1. **Current approval differential**: Multiple sources confirm Carney at 50% and Trump at 44-48% in recent months, with Trump showing a downward trend (52% in January to 48% in April to ~44% in early May).
2. **Carney's honeymoon period**: Carney took office in March/April 2025 after winning a federal election. New leaders typically enjoy a 3-6 month approval boost.
3. **Trump's declining trend**: Multiple sources indicate Trump's approval has been decreasing over recent months (from 52% to 44-48%).

### Moderate Evidence:
1. **Carney's positioning against Trump**: Carney has defined himself partly by standing up to Trump's controversial statements, which appears popular domestically.
2. **Upcoming G7 summit**: Scheduled for June in Alberta, will feature both leaders and could impact ratings.
3. **Technocratic credentials**: Carney's background as former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor lends economic credibility during uncertain times.

### Weak Evidence:
1. **Trump's tariffs on Canada**: Could affect both leaders' approval ratings in unpredictable ways.
2. **Liberal spending plans**: C$130 billion in new spending and larger deficits could impact Canadian economic sentiment.
3. **Regional approval variations**: Both leaders have different approval levels across regions of their countries.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is from May 15, 2025, to July 1, 2025 - approximately 6-7 weeks.

If the timeframe were halved (3-4 weeks): Current trends would likely continue with minimal change. Carney would still be in his honeymoon period, and Trump's numbers would likely remain relatively stable absent major events.

If the timeframe were doubled (3-4 months): Carney's honeymoon effect might begin to wane, and the impact of economic policies from both leaders would become more apparent. The outcomes of Trump's tariff policies and Carney's economic initiatives would have more time to affect public opinion.

## (d) Justification

The outside view prediction suggested a 32% probability that Carney would have higher approval ratings than Trump. However, this requires significant adjustment based on current evidence:

1. **Current approval differential**: The most recent data shows Carney at 50% approval and Trump at 44-48%. This represents a 2-6 point lead for Carney already, suggesting the base rate underestimates the current reality.

2. **Honeymoon effect**: Carney became PM in March/April 2025, meaning he'll still be within the typical 3-6 month "honeymoon period" on July 1st. This typically provides approval ratings boosts.

3. **Contrasting trajectories**: Trump's approval shows a downward trend (52% → 48% → ~44%) while Carney's 50% represents an improvement over his predecessor's 35%.

4. **Political positioning**: Carney has positioned himself as standing up to Trump, which appears popular in Canada based on election results. This dynamic could maintain or strengthen his domestic approval.

5. **Upcoming G7 summit**: This high-profile meeting in June could impact both leaders' approval ratings. Given the recent tense exchanges and Carney hosting on home soil, this could potentially benefit him more.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view prediction of 32% appears too low based on current evidence. The most recent polls already show Carney with a 2-6 percentage point lead, and several factors suggest this lead may maintain or even widen:

1. Carney is still in his honeymoon period, which typically sustains elevated approval ratings.
2. Trump's approval shows a downward trend over recent months.
3. Carney has successfully positioned himself against Trump's controversial statements about Canada.
4. The upcoming G7 summit in Alberta gives Carney a home-field advantage in a direct comparison.

Given these factors, I would adjust the probability significantly upward from 32%. The current leads in polling combined with the contextual factors suggest Carney is more likely than not to maintain his approval advantage through July 1st.

## Checklist:
1. Resolution criteria: Will Mark Carney have higher Morning Consult approval rating than Trump when measured on/after July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 32% from outside view analysis, but current polls already show Carney leading
3. Consistency: "65 out of 100 times, Carney will have higher approval ratings than Trump on July 1, 2025."
4. Key evidence: Current 2-6 point lead; Carney's honeymoon period; Trump's downward trend; Carney's anti-Trump positioning
5. Blind spot: Major international crisis could cause rally effects benefiting Trump
6. Status quo: Current polls show Carney leading; short timeframe suggests persistence of this pattern

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

   - Analysis of Carney's political rise after Trudeau's decline
   - Documents how Carney leveraged Trump's interventions to rally Canadian support
   - Shows Carney's successful electoral strategy using sovereignty defense

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current Morning Consult data** shows Carney at 50%, Trump at 44% (from PoliticalPulse, May 8)
- **Multiple independent sources** confirm Carney currently leads Trump in approval (Visual Capitalist, PoliticalPulse)
- **Trump's documented approval decline** from 52% in January to 48% in April (Visual Capitalist) and 44% in May (PoliticalPulse)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Leadership cycle timing**: Carney is in early honeymoon period (began March/April 2025); Trump in second-term mid-phase when approval typically plateaus or declines
- **Carney's positioning against Trump** appears effective in boosting domestic support (Times of India, Economic Times)
- **Carney's technocratic credentials** (former central bank governor) providing contrast to Trudeau's declining popularity

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Potential economic challenges** affecting both countries that could shift approval
- **Future bilateral tensions** following their recent confrontational meeting

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The question resolves on July 1, 2025 – 47 days from today (May 15, 2025).

This relatively short timeframe has key implications:
- Approval ratings typically don't shift dramatically in 6-7 weeks absent major events
- Carney will still be in his first 4 months in office (honeymoon period)
- Trump will be approximately 1.5 years into his second term

If the timeframe were halved (3-4 weeks), I would be more confident in Carney maintaining his advantage, as his honeymoon effect would be stronger and there would be less time for significant events to change perceptions.

If the timeframe were doubled (3 months), confidence would decrease as Carney's honeymoon might fade and more time would allow for potential policy stumbles or changing economic conditions affecting either leader.

## (d) Justification:

The outside view base rate of 25% requires significant adjustment based on current evidence:

1. **Current approval gap**: Morning Consult currently shows a 6-point advantage for Carney (50% vs. 44%) – this is the exact data source that will determine resolution.

2. **Leadership cycle dynamics**: Carney is early in his tenure when approval typically peaks, while Trump is in a period when presidential approval often stabilizes or declines.

3. **Sovereignty narrative**: Carney has effectively positioned himself against Trump's controversial comments about Canada, creating a patriotic boost to his standing that is likely to persist through July.

4. **Contrasting trajectories**: Carney shows upward movement from Trudeau's low approval (35% to 50%), while Trump shows downward movement (52% to 44-48%).

5. **Economic positioning**: Carney's background as central banker provides credibility during economic uncertainty, potentially sustaining his approval through near-term challenges.

These factors justify a substantial upward adjustment from the outside view base rate, as multiple independent sources confirm Carney's current advantage, and the timeframe is short enough that dramatic reversals are less likely absent major events.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from my outside view base rate of 25%, I make these evidence-based adjustments:

1. **Current Morning Consult advantage for Carney (+6 points)**: +25 percentage points (strong direct evidence from resolution source)

2. **Leadership lifecycle positioning** (Carney honeymoon vs. Trump mid-term): +15 percentage points (well-established political pattern)

3. **Momentum factors** (Carney rising from Trudeau low, Trump declining from January): +10 percentage points

4. **Risk factors**:
   - Potential economic shifts: -5 percentage points
   - Possible Carney policy missteps: -5 percentage points
   - Trump-Carney meeting fallout uncertainties: -5 percentage points

Calibrated probability: 25% + 25% + 15% + 10% - 5% - 5% - 5% = 60%

## Checklist:
1. Question: Will Mark Carney's Morning Consult approval rating exceed Donald Trump's on July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 25% probability based on historical Canadian PM vs. US President approval comparisons
3. Consistency: 60 of 100 times, Carney's approval will exceed Trump's on July 1, given current gap and political dynamics
4. Key evidence: Current 6-point gap (Morning Consult), Carney's honeymoon period vs. Trump's mid-term, effective sovereignty positioning, contrasting approval trajectories
5. Blind spot: Unexpected crisis boosting Trump or early Carney scandal could reverse current patterns
6. Status quo currently favors Carney; 47 days allows for changes but isn't enough time for complete reversal absent major events

Probability: 60%
Predicted Probability: 60.0%

3. Evidence Analysis (weighing)  
   Strong Evidence (+):  
   – Visual Capitalist & PoliticalPulse both show Carney 50% vs. Trump 44–48% (May).  
     (Multiple independent Morning Consult‐based sources)  
   – Historical “honeymoon” effect for new leaders often +10–15 points.  

   Moderate Evidence (+):  
   – Trump’s recent downward trend (52%→48%→44%) amid controversies and tariffs.  
   – Carney’s technocratic reputation and decisive election win fueling goodwill.  

   Moderate Evidence (–):

   – Short timeframe may see mean reversion: honeymoon fades by July, Trump could stabilize.  

4. Reference Class and Base Rate  
   – Ref. class: New leaders replacing unpopular incumbents vs. incumbents’ approval.  
   – Base rate: New‐leader honeymoon exceeds sitting counterparts in ~40% of cases at 2-month mark.  

5. Timeframe Analysis  
   – 47 days until July 1, 2025.  
   – Half the timeframe (~24 days): honeymoon still strong → probability would rise by ~5–10 points.  
   – Double the timeframe (94 days): honeymoon fades, more reversion risk → probability falls by ~10–15 points.

6. Justification and Inside View Adjustment  
   a. Baseline gap: Carney leads now by ~4 points (50% vs. 46%).  
   b. Honeymoon effect will boost Carney further, perhaps to ~55–60%.  
   c. Trump likely remains in mid-40s or decline to low-40s.  
   d. Risks to Carney (early controversies) could shave ~3–5 points.  
   e. Net expected approval: Carney ~52–57%, Trump ~44–47% in early July.  
   f. Thus Carney probably maintains a lead.

Probability calibration  
– My inside‐view forecast: Carney has a significant yet not certain lead.  
– I assign 66% probability that Carney’s July 1 approval (Morning Consult) exceeds Trump’s.  
– A ±10% shift (56–76%) would correspond to modest variations in honeymoon strength or Trump’s stabilization.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will Carney’s Morning Consult approval exceed Trump’s on or after July 1, 2025?”  
2. Base rate: New leader > sitting counterpart ~40% at 2 months; adjust upward given Carney’s current lead.  
3. Consistency: “66 out of 100 times, Carney leads Trump on July 1 per criteria.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Carney 50% vs. Trump 44–48% (Morning Consult)  
   • Strong honeymoon for new leaders (+10–15 pts)  
   • Trump’s downward trend amid controversies  
   • Carney’s technocratic credibility and election mandate  
5. Blind‐spot: A major U.S. crisis or policy success boosting Trump’s numbers sharply.  
6. Status quo: Carney currently leads; world likely holds similar dynamics in next 47 days.

Probability: 66%
Predicted Probability: 66.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase and resolution criteria  
We ask: “On or after July 1, 2025, will Morning Consult’s global leader tracker show Mark Carney’s approval rating strictly above Donald Trump’s?” Ties count as No.

2. Outside‐view base rate  
Historical reference: Republican U.S. presidents almost always lead new Canadian PMs by ~10–15 points on global approval. Only in one extreme case (early COVID 2020) did Canada’s leader briefly exceed Trump. Rough base‐rate ≈5–10%.

3. Source analysis  
a. VisualCapitalist (Apr 30, 2025): Morning Consult global approval—Carney 50%, Trump 48%. High‐quality, direct data. (Strong evidence)  
b. The PoliticalPulse/The PoliticalPulse (May 15, 2025): Morning Consult 7-day MA (May 2–8) matches Carney 50%, Trump ~44% global. Credible. (Strong)  
c. Economic Times (May 2025): Canadian domestic vote intentions boost Carney honeymoon; no direct approval data but supports his popularity. (Moderate)  
d. CNN (May 6, 2025): Oval Office meeting—Trump’s tariff threats and awkward tone; no polling but suggests further dent to Trump’s global image. (Moderate)  
e. BBC (Apr 29, 2025): Profile of Carney’s technocratic reputation and global stature. No polling but underpins likely high initial approval. (Weak–moderate)  
f. NorthJersey/Kitsap Sun: U.S. domestic Trump approval ~45%. Useful as lower‐bound guide to his global standing. (Moderate)

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
• Carney’s current global lead of ~2–6 points (VisualCapitalist, PoliticalPulse): Strong evidence he already leads.  
• Carney honeymoon effect: new‐PM bump of ~10–15 points vs. predecessor (Trudeau ended at ~35% → Carney 50%). Likely persists into July. (Moderate)  
• Trump trending downward due to tariffs, controversies, and policy flip-flops; global approval likely stable or falling from 48%. (Moderate)  
• No major crisis or event scheduled before July 1 that would flip Carney’s or Trump’s ratings by >10 points. (Moderate)  
• Institutional inertia: Morning Consult’s 7-day MA smooths out short blips. (Strong)

5. Timeframe analysis  
Horizon ≈47 days. In a 3–4-week MA tracker window, neither leader’s approval is likely to swing more than 5–7 points absent a major shock. Halving timeframe → even less chance of large swings → probability edges up a few points. Doubling → more time for countermoves by Trump or policy missteps by Carney → probability edges down.

6. Inside‐view adjustment and justification  
Start from base‐rate ≈7% (rare occurrence). Then strong evidence Carney already leads and likely to maintain his honeymoon bump plus modest declines for Trump. These factors push us well above base rate. We consider:  
– Carney’s current ~50% vs Trump ~46–48% global approval (+4 point gap).  
– Persistence of novelty/competence halo for Carney; no imminent negatives.  
– Trump’s approval sticky mid-40s or trending down under recent controversies.  
We thus adjust from ~7% to a much higher probability—but remain cautious because Carney’s lead is small and global opinion can shift. A midpoint judgment is ~65% chance that Carney still leads on July 1.

Probability calibration  
I believe that in about two-thirds of comparable scenarios (newly popular Canadian PM vs. embattled Republican president in a 1.5-month window), the newcomer’s lead endures when starting with a 2–4-point advantage on a smoothing tracker.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Yes, global‐tracker approval on or after July 1, 2025; ties are No.  
2. Base rate: ~5–10% historically; we’ve explained why current factors differ.  
3. Consistency check: “65 out of 100 times, Carney will still lead.” This aligns with our reasoning on persistence of a small but real lead.  
4. Top evidences:  
   • Carney’s current 50% vs Trump’s 48% (strong)  
   • Carney honeymoon bump (moderate)  
   • Trump controversies trending global approval down (moderate)  
5. Blind‐spot: A sudden Canada-U.S. trade war escalation or domestic scandal for Carney could flip ratings—unlikely but worth monitoring.  
6. Status quo: No news implies stability; this supports a moderate tilt toward Carney maintaining lead.

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
‣ Visual Capitalist, 30 Apr 2025 – Republished Morning Consult figures for late-April; non-expert commentary but uses MC’s raw data. Recent (≤3 wks). Mostly factual; opinions about “voter fatigue” noted. Reliability: Medium (data from MC, interpretation by journalist).  
‣ PoliticalPulse (N. Singh), 15 May 2025 – Directly quotes Morning Consult May 2-8 seven-day average. Methodology disclosed, numeric ratings given. Reliability: Medium-high; single source but recent (≤1 wk). Opinions (e.g., “core support remains steady”) filtered.  
‣ Economic Times (Canada spending), no polling newer than Apr 20 – Background on Carney fiscal plan; useful for possible future approval drag. Reliability: Medium (mainstream outlet). Mostly factual.  
‣ CNN Politics, 06 May 2025 – Descriptive account of Carney-Trump meeting; no approval numbers. Reliability: High for facts of meeting; speculative for impact on approval.  
‣ BBC profile, 29 Apr 2025 – Background on Carney career and stated positions. No approval figures; helps understand structural popularity drivers. Reliability: High for biographical facts.  
‣ Times of India, 30 Apr 2025 – Narrative of Canadian election; no fresh polling. Reliability: Medium.  

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong evidence  
• Morning Consult May 2-8: Carney 50 / Trump 44 (+6). (direct, identified, method)  
• Historical MC tracker (2017-24) shows Canadian PMs usually equal-or-higher than Trump; base-rate ≈ 55-60 %. (historical pattern)  

Moderate evidence  
• “Honeymoon” bump for new leaders typically lasts 3-6 months; Carney inaugurated Mar 2025, still inside window. (historical pattern)  
• Trump’s approval in 2nd term started a few points below 50 and trending down since January. (current trend)  
• Carney’s very large fiscal-stimulus plan could erode approval as opposition messaging ramps up. (plausible causal)  

Weak evidence  
• Single CNN meeting could marginally shift Canadian or US sentiment.  
• Speculation that Trump may get “rally-round-the-flag” boost from upcoming G7 in Alberta.  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days until snapshot: 47.  
If time were halved (≈ 3½ wks): less opportunity for reversal → probability of Carney-ahead +4 pp.  
If doubled (≈ 13 wks): fade of Carney honeymoon & policy battles → probability –10 pp.  

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate: 57 % chance that a Canadian PM tops a US president on any random MC reading since 2017.  
Current inside factors push upward: Carney already +6; statistical noise (σ≈3-4 pts) implies ~80 % likelihood he stays ≥0 if mean gap unchanged. Short horizon and honeymoon support the mean persisting.  
Downward pressures (deficit headlines, Conservative attack ads, “tariff war” fatigue) warrant trimming 5-10 pp.  
I therefore adjust base from 57 → 75 %.  

Probability calibration
Point estimate 75 %.  In 100 comparable situations with present conditions, I expect Carney’s approval to exceed Trump’s on July 1 about 75 times.

Checklist:
1 Title+criteria: On 1 Jul 2025, Morning Consult number; Carney must exceed Trump, tie = No.  
2 Base rate: 57 % (historic MC 2017-24 comparisons).  
3 Consistency: “75 out of 100 times, Carney’s rating is higher.”  
4 Key evidence: (i) Current MC gap +6; (ii) New-leader honeymoon lasts ≥3 mo; (iii) Trump trend downward since Jan; (iv) Snapshot only 47 days away.  
5 Blind-spot: Sudden US geopolitical success (e.g., hostage rescue, economic surge) gives Trump +5 pts. Would cut Yes odds ≈ 20 pp.  
6 Status-quo: Current state already favors Yes; modest reversion to mean still leaves gap positive.

Probability: 75%
Predicted Probability: 75.0%

   - Quality: Moderate (contextual political information but secondary source)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
1. **Current approval differential**: Multiple sources confirm Carney at 50% and Trump at 44-48% in recent months, with Trump showing a downward trend (52% in January to 48% in April to ~44% in early May).
2. **Carney's honeymoon period**: Carney took office in March/April 2025 after winning a federal election. New leaders typically enjoy a 3-6 month approval boost.
3. **Trump's declining trend**: Multiple sources indicate Trump's approval has been decreasing over recent months (from 52% to 44-48%).

### Moderate Evidence:
1. **Carney's positioning against Trump**: Carney has defined himself partly by standing up to Trump's controversial statements, which appears popular domestically.
2. **Upcoming G7 summit**: Scheduled for June in Alberta, will feature both leaders and could impact ratings.
3. **Technocratic credentials**: Carney's background as former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor lends economic credibility during uncertain times.

### Weak Evidence:
1. **Trump's tariffs on Canada**: Could affect both leaders' approval ratings in unpredictable ways.
2. **Liberal spending plans**: C$130 billion in new spending and larger deficits could impact Canadian economic sentiment.
3. **Regional approval variations**: Both leaders have different approval levels across regions of their countries.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is from May 15, 2025, to July 1, 2025 - approximately 6-7 weeks.

If the timeframe were halved (3-4 weeks): Current trends would likely continue with minimal change. Carney would still be in his honeymoon period, and Trump's numbers would likely remain relatively stable absent major events.

If the timeframe were doubled (3-4 months): Carney's honeymoon effect might begin to wane, and the impact of economic policies from both leaders would become more apparent. The outcomes of Trump's tariff policies and Carney's economic initiatives would have more time to affect public opinion.

## (d) Justification

The outside view prediction suggested a 32% probability that Carney would have higher approval ratings than Trump. However, this requires significant adjustment based on current evidence:

1. **Current approval differential**: The most recent data shows Carney at 50% approval and Trump at 44-48%. This represents a 2-6 point lead for Carney already, suggesting the base rate underestimates the current reality.

2. **Honeymoon effect**: Carney became PM in March/April 2025, meaning he'll still be within the typical 3-6 month "honeymoon period" on July 1st. This typically provides approval ratings boosts.

3. **Contrasting trajectories**: Trump's approval shows a downward trend (52% → 48% → ~44%) while Carney's 50% represents an improvement over his predecessor's 35%.

4. **Political positioning**: Carney has positioned himself as standing up to Trump, which appears popular in Canada based on election results. This dynamic could maintain or strengthen his domestic approval.

5. **Upcoming G7 summit**: This high-profile meeting in June could impact both leaders' approval ratings. Given the recent tense exchanges and Carney hosting on home soil, this could potentially benefit him more.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view prediction of 32% appears too low based on current evidence. The most recent polls already show Carney with a 2-6 percentage point lead, and several factors suggest this lead may maintain or even widen:

1. Carney is still in his honeymoon period, which typically sustains elevated approval ratings.
2. Trump's approval shows a downward trend over recent months.
3. Carney has successfully positioned himself against Trump's controversial statements about Canada.
4. The upcoming G7 summit in Alberta gives Carney a home-field advantage in a direct comparison.

Given these factors, I would adjust the probability significantly upward from 32%. The current leads in polling combined with the contextual factors suggest Carney is more likely than not to maintain his approval advantage through July 1st.

## Checklist:
1. Resolution criteria: Will Mark Carney have higher Morning Consult approval rating than Trump when measured on/after July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 32% from outside view analysis, but current polls already show Carney leading
3. Consistency: "65 out of 100 times, Carney will have higher approval ratings than Trump on July 1, 2025."
4. Key evidence: Current 2-6 point lead; Carney's honeymoon period; Trump's downward trend; Carney's anti-Trump positioning
5. Blind spot: Major international crisis could cause rally effects benefiting Trump
6. Status quo: Current polls show Carney leading; short timeframe suggests persistence of this pattern

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Visual Capitalist (April 30, 2025)**
   - Reputable data visualization source reporting global leader approval ratings
   - Shows Carney at 50% approval, Trump at 48% (down from 52% in January)
   - Indicates Carney's popularity improvement from Trudeau's 35%
   - Factual polling data with minimal opinion content

2. **PoliticalPulse (May 15, 2025)**
   - Very recent source citing Morning Consult data for May 2-8
   - Particularly valuable as Morning Consult is specified in resolution criteria
   - Reports Carney at 50% approval, Trump at 44% second-term average
   - Provides context on factors driving each leader's approval

3. **Economic Times (April 2025)**
   - Coverage of Canadian election with Nanos Research polling
   - Shows strong electoral support for Carney (43.7% Liberal vs 36.3% Conservative)
   - Documents Carney's economic warnings about Trump and U.S. reliance
   - More focused on electoral politics than approval ratings

4. **CNN (May 6, 2025)**
   - Recent reporting on Carney-Trump Oval Office meeting
   - Documents tensions, including Trump's "51st state" comments and Carney's pushback
   - No approval rating data but illustrates relationship dynamics that could influence public perception

5. **BBC (April 29, 2025)**
   - Profile of Carney highlighting background and qualifications
   - Documents his direct opposition to Trump's "ridiculous, insulting" remarks
   - Provides context on Carney's reputation as crisis manager and negotiator

6. **Times of India (April 30, 2025)**
   - Analysis of Carney's political rise after Trudeau's decline
   - Documents how Carney leveraged Trump's interventions to rally Canadian support
   - Shows Carney's successful electoral strategy using sovereignty defense

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current Morning Consult data** shows Carney at 50%, Trump at 44% (from PoliticalPulse, May 8)
- **Multiple independent sources** confirm Carney currently leads Trump in approval (Visual Capitalist, PoliticalPulse)
- **Trump's documented approval decline** from 52% in January to 48% in April (Visual Capitalist) and 44% in May (PoliticalPulse)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Leadership cycle timing**: Carney is in early honeymoon period (began March/April 2025); Trump in second-term mid-phase when approval typically plateaus or declines
- **Carney's positioning against Trump** appears effective in boosting domestic support (Times of India, Economic Times)
- **Carney's technocratic credentials** (former central bank governor) providing contrast to Trudeau's declining popularity

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Potential economic challenges** affecting both countries that could shift approval
- **Future bilateral tensions** following their recent confrontational meeting

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The question resolves on July 1, 2025 – 47 days from today (May 15, 2025).

This relatively short timeframe has key implications:
- Approval ratings typically don't shift dramatically in 6-7 weeks absent major events
- Carney will still be in his first 4 months in office (honeymoon period)
- Trump will be approximately 1.5 years into his second term

If the timeframe were halved (3-4 weeks), I would be more confident in Carney maintaining his advantage, as his honeymoon effect would be stronger and there would be less time for significant events to change perceptions.

If the timeframe were doubled (3 months), confidence would decrease as Carney's honeymoon might fade and more time would allow for potential policy stumbles or changing economic conditions affecting either leader.

## (d) Justification:

The outside view base rate of 25% requires significant adjustment based on current evidence:

1. **Current approval gap**: Morning Consult currently shows a 6-point advantage for Carney (50% vs. 44%) – this is the exact data source that will determine resolution.

2. **Leadership cycle dynamics**: Carney is early in his tenure when approval typically peaks, while Trump is in a period when presidential approval often stabilizes or declines.

3. **Sovereignty narrative**: Carney has effectively positioned himself against Trump's controversial comments about Canada, creating a patriotic boost to his standing that is likely to persist through July.

4. **Contrasting trajectories**: Carney shows upward movement from Trudeau's low approval (35% to 50%), while Trump shows downward movement (52% to 44-48%).

5. **Economic positioning**: Carney's background as central banker provides credibility during economic uncertainty, potentially sustaining his approval through near-term challenges.

These factors justify a substantial upward adjustment from the outside view base rate, as multiple independent sources confirm Carney's current advantage, and the timeframe is short enough that dramatic reversals are less likely absent major events.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from my outside view base rate of 25%, I make these evidence-based adjustments:

1. **Current Morning Consult advantage for Carney (+6 points)**: +25 percentage points (strong direct evidence from resolution source)

2. **Leadership lifecycle positioning** (Carney honeymoon vs. Trump mid-term): +15 percentage points (well-established political pattern)

3. **Momentum factors** (Carney rising from Trudeau low, Trump declining from January): +10 percentage points

4. **Risk factors**:
   - Potential economic shifts: -5 percentage points
   - Possible Carney policy missteps: -5 percentage points
   - Trump-Carney meeting fallout uncertainties: -5 percentage points

Calibrated probability: 25% + 25% + 15% + 10% - 5% - 5% - 5% = 60%

## Checklist:
1. Question: Will Mark Carney's Morning Consult approval rating exceed Donald Trump's on July 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: 25% probability based on historical Canadian PM vs. US President approval comparisons
3. Consistency: 60 of 100 times, Carney's approval will exceed Trump's on July 1, given current gap and political dynamics
4. Key evidence: Current 6-point gap (Morning Consult), Carney's honeymoon period vs. Trump's mid-term, effective sovereignty positioning, contrasting approval trajectories
5. Blind spot: Unexpected crisis boosting Trump or early Carney scandal could reverse current patterns
6. Status quo currently favors Carney; 47 days allows for changes but isn't enough time for complete reversal absent major events

Probability: 60%
Predicted Probability: 60.0%

2. Source Analysis  
   a. Visual Capitalist (Apr 30, 2025) – “Ranked: World’s Most and Least Popular Leaders”  
      • Reports Morning Consult global approval: Carney 50% vs. Trump 48%.  
      • Well–sourced, uses Morning Consult data; high credibility.  
   b. PoliticalPulse/The PoliticalPulse (May 15, 2025) – May 2–8 Morning Consult data  
      • Trump 44% average (up from 41% in first term); Carney 50%.  
      • Cites Morning Consult pro; moderate–high reliability.  
   c. Economic Times (May 2025) – Pre-election polling (Nanos)  
      • Shows Carney’s party surge and his economic messaging. No direct approval figures.  
      • Reliable methodology for vote intent; indirect for approval.  
   d. CNN Politics (May 6, 2025) – Oval Office meeting summary  
      • No polling; offers context on U.S.–Canada tensions, which can sway approval.  
      • Background color, moderate reliability.  
   e. BBC Profile (Apr 29, 2025) – Carney’s biography  
      • No approval numbers; establishes credibility, policymaking reputation.  
      • Reputable, but qualitative.  
   f. Times of India (Apr 30, 2025) – Election narrative  
      • Describes how Trump’s interventions boosted Carney’s campaign.  
      • Credible for political context; no direct approval data.

3. Evidence Analysis (weighing)  
   Strong Evidence (+):  
   – Visual Capitalist & PoliticalPulse both show Carney 50% vs. Trump 44–48% (May).  
     (Multiple independent Morning Consult‐based sources)  
   – Historical “honeymoon” effect for new leaders often +10–15 points.  

   Moderate Evidence (+):  
   – Trump’s recent downward trend (52%→48%→44%) amid controversies and tariffs.  
   – Carney’s technocratic reputation and decisive election win fueling goodwill.  

   Moderate Evidence (–):  
   – Carney’s inexperience in elected office could trigger missteps (blind trust questions, deficit criticisms).  
   – Short timeframe may see mean reversion: honeymoon fades by July, Trump could stabilize.  

4. Reference Class and Base Rate  
   – Ref. class: New leaders replacing unpopular incumbents vs. incumbents’ approval.  
   – Base rate: New‐leader honeymoon exceeds sitting counterparts in ~40% of cases at 2-month mark.  

5. Timeframe Analysis  
   – 47 days until July 1, 2025.  
   – Half the timeframe (~24 days): honeymoon still strong → probability would rise by ~5–10 points.  
   – Double the timeframe (94 days): honeymoon fades, more reversion risk → probability falls by ~10–15 points.

6. Justification and Inside View Adjustment  
   a. Baseline gap: Carney leads now by ~4 points (50% vs. 46%).  
   b. Honeymoon effect will boost Carney further, perhaps to ~55–60%.  
   c. Trump likely remains in mid-40s or decline to low-40s.  
   d. Risks to Carney (early controversies) could shave ~3–5 points.  
   e. Net expected approval: Carney ~52–57%, Trump ~44–47% in early July.  
   f. Thus Carney probably maintains a lead.

Probability calibration  
– My inside‐view forecast: Carney has a significant yet not certain lead.  
– I assign 66% probability that Carney’s July 1 approval (Morning Consult) exceeds Trump’s.  
– A ±10% shift (56–76%) would correspond to modest variations in honeymoon strength or Trump’s stabilization.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will Carney’s Morning Consult approval exceed Trump’s on or after July 1, 2025?”  
2. Base rate: New leader > sitting counterpart ~40% at 2 months; adjust upward given Carney’s current lead.  
3. Consistency: “66 out of 100 times, Carney leads Trump on July 1 per criteria.”  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Carney 50% vs. Trump 44–48% (Morning Consult)  
   • Strong honeymoon for new leaders (+10–15 pts)  
   • Trump’s downward trend amid controversies  
   • Carney’s technocratic credibility and election mandate  
5. Blind‐spot: A major U.S. crisis or policy success boosting Trump’s numbers sharply.  
6. Status quo: Carney currently leads; world likely holds similar dynamics in next 47 days.

2. Outside‐view base rate  
Historical reference: Republican U.S. presidents almost always lead new Canadian PMs by ~10–15 points on global approval. Only in one extreme case (early COVID 2020) did Canada’s leader briefly exceed Trump. Rough base‐rate ≈5–10%.

3. Source analysis

c. Economic Times (May 2025): Canadian domestic vote intentions boost Carney honeymoon; no direct approval data but supports his popularity. (Moderate)  
d. CNN (May 6, 2025): Oval Office meeting—Trump’s tariff threats and awkward tone; no polling but suggests further dent to Trump’s global image. (Moderate)  
e. BBC (Apr 29, 2025): Profile of Carney’s technocratic reputation and global stature. No polling but underpins likely high initial approval. (Weak–moderate)  
f. NorthJersey/Kitsap Sun: U.S. domestic Trump approval ~45%. Useful as lower‐bound guide to his global standing. (Moderate)

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
• Carney’s current global lead of ~2–6 points (VisualCapitalist, PoliticalPulse): Strong evidence he already leads.  
• Carney honeymoon effect: new‐PM bump of ~10–15 points vs. predecessor (Trudeau ended at ~35% → Carney 50%). Likely persists into July. (Moderate)  
• Trump trending downward due to tariffs, controversies, and policy flip-flops; global approval likely stable or falling from 48%. (Moderate)  
• No major crisis or event scheduled before July 1 that would flip Carney’s or Trump’s ratings by >10 points. (Moderate)  
• Institutional inertia: Morning Consult’s 7-day MA smooths out short blips. (Strong)

5. Timeframe analysis  
Horizon ≈47 days. In a 3–4-week MA tracker window, neither leader’s approval is likely to swing more than 5–7 points absent a major shock. Halving timeframe → even less chance of large swings → probability edges up a few points. Doubling → more time for countermoves by Trump or policy missteps by Carney → probability edges down.

6. Inside‐view adjustment and justification  
Start from base‐rate ≈7% (rare occurrence). Then strong evidence Carney already leads and likely to maintain his honeymoon bump plus modest declines for Trump. These factors push us well above base rate. We consider:  
– Carney’s current ~50% vs Trump ~46–48% global approval (+4 point gap).  
– Persistence of novelty/competence halo for Carney; no imminent negatives.  
– Trump’s approval sticky mid-40s or trending down under recent controversies.  
We thus adjust from ~7% to a much higher probability—but remain cautious because Carney’s lead is small and global opinion can shift. A midpoint judgment is ~65% chance that Carney still leads on July 1.

Probability calibration  
I believe that in about two-thirds of comparable scenarios (newly popular Canadian PM vs. embattled Republican president in a 1.5-month window), the newcomer’s lead endures when starting with a 2–4-point advantage on a smoothing tracker.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Yes, global‐tracker approval on or after July 1, 2025; ties are No.  
2. Base rate: ~5–10% historically; we’ve explained why current factors differ.  
3. Consistency check: “65 out of 100 times, Carney will still lead.” This aligns with our reasoning on persistence of a small but real lead.  
4. Top evidences:  
   • Carney’s current 50% vs Trump’s 48% (strong)  
   • Carney honeymoon bump (moderate)  
   • Trump controversies trending global approval down (moderate)  
5. Blind‐spot: A sudden Canada-U.S. trade war escalation or domestic scandal for Carney could flip ratings—unlikely but worth monitoring.  
6. Status quo: No news implies stability; this supports a moderate tilt toward Carney maintaining lead.

Probability: 65%
Predicted Probability: 65.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
‣ Visual Capitalist, 30 Apr 2025 – Republished Morning Consult figures for late-April; non-expert commentary but uses MC’s raw data. Recent (≤3 wks). Mostly factual; opinions about “voter fatigue” noted. Reliability: Medium (data from MC, interpretation by journalist).  
‣ PoliticalPulse (N. Singh), 15 May 2025 – Directly quotes Morning Consult May 2-8 seven-day average. Methodology disclosed, numeric ratings given. Reliability: Medium-high; single source but recent (≤1 wk). Opinions (e.g., “core support remains steady”) filtered.  
‣ Economic Times (Canada spending), no polling newer than Apr 20 – Background on Carney fiscal plan; useful for possible future approval drag. Reliability: Medium (mainstream outlet). Mostly factual.  
‣ CNN Politics, 06 May 2025 – Descriptive account of Carney-Trump meeting; no approval numbers. Reliability: High for facts of meeting; speculative for impact on approval.  
‣ BBC profile, 29 Apr 2025 – Background on Carney career and stated positions. No approval figures; helps understand structural popularity drivers. Reliability: High for biographical facts.  
‣ Times of India, 30 Apr 2025 – Narrative of Canadian election; no fresh polling. Reliability: Medium.  

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong evidence  
• Morning Consult May 2-8: Carney 50 / Trump 44 (+6). (direct, identified, method)  
• Historical MC tracker (2017-24) shows Canadian PMs usually equal-or-higher than Trump; base-rate ≈ 55-60 %. (historical pattern)  

Moderate evidence  
• “Honeymoon” bump for new leaders typically lasts 3-6 months; Carney inaugurated Mar 2025, still inside window. (historical pattern)  
• Trump’s approval in 2nd term started a few points below 50 and trending down since January. (current trend)  
• Carney’s very large fiscal-stimulus plan could erode approval as opposition messaging ramps up. (plausible causal)  

Weak evidence  
• Single CNN meeting could marginally shift Canadian or US sentiment.  
• Speculation that Trump may get “rally-round-the-flag” boost from upcoming G7 in Alberta.  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days until snapshot: 47.  
If time were halved (≈ 3½ wks): less opportunity for reversal → probability of Carney-ahead +4 pp.  
If doubled (≈ 13 wks): fade of Carney honeymoon & policy battles → probability –10 pp.  

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate: 57 % chance that a Canadian PM tops a US president on any random MC reading since 2017.  
Current inside factors push upward: Carney already +6; statistical noise (σ≈3-4 pts) implies ~80 % likelihood he stays ≥0 if mean gap unchanged. Short horizon and honeymoon support the mean persisting.  
Downward pressures (deficit headlines, Conservative attack ads, “tariff war” fatigue) warrant trimming 5-10 pp.  
I therefore adjust base from 57 → 75 %.  

Probability calibration
Point estimate 75 %.  In 100 comparable situations with present conditions, I expect Carney’s approval to exceed Trump’s on July 1 about 75 times.

Checklist:
1 Title+criteria: On 1 Jul 2025, Morning Consult number; Carney must exceed Trump, tie = No.  
2 Base rate: 57 % (historic MC 2017-24 comparisons).  
3 Consistency: “75 out of 100 times, Carney’s rating is higher.”  
4 Key evidence: (i) Current MC gap +6; (ii) New-leader honeymoon lasts ≥3 mo; (iii) Trump trend downward since Jan; (iv) Snapshot only 47 days away.  
5 Blind-spot: Sudden US geopolitical success (e.g., hostage rescue, economic surge) gives Trump +5 pts. Would cut Yes odds ≈ 20 pp.  
6 Status-quo: Current state already favors Yes; modest reversion to mean still leaves gap positive.

Probability: 75%
Predicted Probability: 75.0%...
