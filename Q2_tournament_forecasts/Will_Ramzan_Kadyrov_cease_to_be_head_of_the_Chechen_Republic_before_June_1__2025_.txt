Analysis:
This question hinges on understanding the institutional and personal dynamics that have kept Ramzan Kadyrov in power since 2007 and whether there is any precedent or mechanism for his voluntary resignation or forced removal. To form an out-view, I need historical data on (a) how heads of the Chechen Republic are appointed and dismissed, (b) any past instances of Kadyrov or his predecessors resigning or being replaced, (c) the role of the Kremlin in installing and potentially removing Chechen leaders, and (d) whether any political or security crises have ever threatened his tenure. These points will help me establish a base‐rate probability for an incumbent Chechen leader’s removal and for any atypical scenarios.

Analysis:
Ramzan Kadyrov’s May 6 declaration that he “wants to step down” as head of Chechnya is unprecedented but needs Moscow’s approval to be credible. Key factors to research include:
- The Kremlin’s public and behind-the-scenes reaction: Are they supportive, skeptical, or planning to keep him in place?
- Appointments or rumors about a designated successor or caretaker administration.
- Indicators of Kadyrov’s political standing: official meetings, appearances, security reshuffles, or any move by federal agencies (e.g., FSB, Presidential Administration) to limit his power.
- Kadyrov’s health or personal circumstances that could force an exit.
- Local Chechen political developments: legislative actions, party congresses, or public opinion shifts.
These will inform whether his announced intent is a genuine step toward leaving office before June 1, 2025.

Disclaimer: summary is based solely on the Jamestown article provided.

1. Recent Resignation Request  
  • On May 5, 2025, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov formally asked President Putin to relieve him of his post—his fourth such request (previous: Jan 21 2020; Mar 9 2023; Jun 12 2024).  
  • Kadyrov said only Putin can grant his resignation; Putin had not publicly commented as of May 6 (Gazeta.ru) and reportedly turned him down in a May 7 meeting before Victory Day (Smotrim).

2. Motives and Context  
  • Observers suspect Kadyrov’s request is a bid for renewed Kremlin backing rather than a genuine desire to step aside (MK.ru).  
  • His health is reportedly poor—hospitalizations for pancreatic necrosis, which carries a 79.1% one-year mortality in Russia (Russian Open Medical Journal, Oct 5 2020; The Moscow Times Apr 22 2024; Novaya Gazeta Evropa May 5).

3. Succession Scenarios  
  • Russian analysts debate potential successors:  
    – Apti Alautdinov (39), deputy head of the Main Administration for Military-Political Work in the Russian Armed Forces.  
    – Kadyrov’s children or close loyalists, many of whom he’s been elevating in Grozny (Lenta.ru; Novie Izvestia; Prodolzhenie Sleduet).  
  • Any transition would require a new power base—likely prolonged and unstable, risking violent clashes among:  
    – Disaffected Kadyrov loyalists.  
    – Domestic Chechen opposition (secularist) vs. Islamist groups Kadyrov has backed.  
    – Exiled opposition with alleged Ukrainian government ties (EDM July 28 2024; Kavkaz Realii Oct 19 2024).

4. Regional and Federal Implications  
  • A leadership vacuum in Chechnya could reignite territorial disputes with Ingushetia and Dagestan (EDM Sept 27 2018; Dec 1 2021; Window on Eurasia Oct 20; Dec 20 2024).  
  • Other North Caucasus republics might exploit perceived weakness, potentially prompting Moscow intervention and wider instability.  
  • Russians monitoring Putin’s eventual succession may view Chechnya’s transition as a bellwether for federal power shifts.

5. Wild-Card: Ethnic-Russian Appointment  
  • Human rights activist Musa Lomayaev (Poligon Media, Feb 12) argues an ethnic Russian appointee could “save the Chechen people” and deflect Kadyrov’s crimes onto him.  
  • Such a move would alarm non-Russian republics, fearing similar federal overreach.

6. Outlook  
  • No decision on Kadyrov’s latest resignation request has been announced.  
  • His repeated retirement overtures, declining health, and Kremlin reluctance suggest eventual replacement remains possible but would likely trigger a protracted, conflict-prone power struggle in Chechnya and beyond.

Below is a summary of the June 25, 2021 RFE/RL article “Amid Outrage Abroad, Chechen Strongman Kadyrov Lays The Groundwork For A Fourth Term.”  

• In February 2016, weeks before Chechnya’s executive‐branch election, incumbent head Ramzan Kadyrov said on state television, “My time has passed… We have got very good specialists.”  
  – A last‐minute campaign of videos (weeping women and children) and statements (e.g. from the Chechen rights ombudsman) urged him to stay, claiming his resignation would violate Chechen rights.  
  – A self-styled “Civic Forum of the Chechen Republic” (previously unknown) declared, “Society sees no alternative to [Kadyrov].”  
  – Official results gave Kadyrov a third term with 98% of the vote; government critics allege fraud and voter coercion.  

• As his third term neared its end in 2021, Kadyrov appeared set to run for a fourth term in the September 17–19 national legislative elections despite a well-documented record of human-rights abuses:  
  – Human Rights Watch has cited “egregious cases of torture, public humiliation, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings” under his rule.  
  – Individuals tied to Kadyrov have been convicted of or implicated in the killings of journalist Anna Politkovskaya, activist Natalya Estimirova, opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, and others.  

• On June 23, 2021, Grozny hosted a “Global Congress of the Peoples of Chechnya,” announced only days earlier:  
  – RFE/RL reports 5,000 delegates from 23 countries attended, though established Chechen-diaspora groups say they received no advance notice and did not send representatives.  
    • Aslan Murtazaliyev (head, Association of Chechens of Europe): “They are phantoms, and no one here knows them.”  
  – State Duma Deputy Adam Delimkhanov proclaimed, “Ramzan [Kadyrov] is the only candidate for the post of head of the Chechen Republic.”  
  – Ali Bazhayev (self-styled vice president, Alliance of Chechens in France) and former Supreme Soviet chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov also publicly urged Chechens to back Kadyrov.  
  – A procession led by Chechnya’s chief mufti, Salakh Mezhiyev, delivered a unanimous resolution calling on Kadyrov “in the name of all the clans, all the villages, and all the respected figures of Islam” to run again.  

• Analysts quoted by RFE/RL said the congress was hastily organized to coincide with Kadyrov’s video conference with President Vladimir Putin that afternoon.  
  – Putin praised Kadyrov’s economic stewardship and urged him “to continue your work.”  
  – Human Rights Watch called Putin’s remark that Chechnya is “one of the safest places” in Russia “particularly cynical.”  

• Two days before the congress, Chechen state-TV head Chingiz Akhmadov threatened on Instagram: “If someone needs to be killed… we will kill… any enemy of Ramzan Kadyrov is an enemy of the Chechen people.”  

• Background on Kadyrov’s tenure:  
  – Born into the family of Akhmed Kadyrov (assassinated 2004), Ramzan served as prime minister before being appointed Chechen president by Putin in 2007 and granted a second term by Medvedev in 2011.  
  – During that second term, the title changed from “president” to “head” of the Chechen Republic.

<Summary source="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/08/kadyrov-dismisses-retirement-rumors-after-receiving-support-from-putin-a89018">
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov met with President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on May 8, 2025, and announced on his Telegram channel that he “received full understanding and support” from Moscow amid widespread rumors about his future. Earlier this week Kadyrov said he had asked Putin to relieve him of his post, but he quickly backtracked—insisting he remains a “team player” and will continue serving.

Key points:

• Kadyrov’s own statements  
  – “I could turn to [Putin] with any question and always receive support. Just like today.”  
  – After the meeting: “The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated,” quoting Mark Twain and attributing the line to Putin, who allegedly said there is “still a lot of work to do.”

• Speculation and context  
  – Some analysts (unnamed) view Kadyrov’s hints at stepping down as a tactic to extract financial or security guarantees from Moscow rather than a genuine retirement plan.  
  – There have been unconfirmed reports of Kadyrov’s worsening health and growing tensions with Putin over his “unauthorized” outreach to Middle Eastern officials about post-leadership security arrangements.

• Background  
  – Putin first appointed Kadyrov in 2007 after the assassination of his father, Akhmat Kadyrov, who had switched allegiance to Moscow during the first Chechen war.

Here are the key points from The Moscow Times article “Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader” (May 6, 2025):

1. Reported Remarks by Kadyrov  
  • Ramzan Kadyrov (48) told regional outlet Chechnya Today he has “once again” asked to be relieved of his post as head of the Chechen Republic.  
  • He acknowledged media rumors that he may soon resign but didn’t clarify if he was serious.  
  • Shortly thereafter, on his Telegram channel, Kadyrov wrote that only President Vladimir Putin—the “Supreme Commander-in-Chief”—could remove him, calling himself “a foot soldier” who follows orders.

2. Historical and Biographical Facts  
  • Appointed by Putin in 2007 after his father Akhmat Kadyrov was assassinated.  
  • Fought against Russian forces in the First Chechen War, switched allegiance in the Second Chechen War, and rose through Moscow’s ranks.

3. Analysis and Expert Opinion (named, reliable source)  
  • Harold Chambers, Caucasus researcher, told The Moscow Times:  
    – Kadyrov likely uses resignation talk as a negotiating tactic to extract guarantees or greater budget support from Moscow.  
    – He also gains media attention whenever he hints at retirement.  
    – Recent discussion of his health—and reports of his “lifeline” contacts with Middle Eastern officials—may be straining Kremlin ties.

4. Investigative Reporting (less reliable/unnamed Middle Eastern sources)  
  • In March, the outlet IStories reported Kadyrov has quietly sought assurances from Middle Eastern officials to protect his family and assets if his rule ends—allegedly worrying the Kremlin.

5. Internal Maneuvering and Speculation  
  • Kadyrov recently removed his daughter Aishat as Chechnya’s deputy prime minister and transferred business assets to other family members, fueling further speculation he’s preparing to leave office.

Note: It remains unclear whether Kadyrov’s latest comments represent a genuine intent to step down or a strategic ploy to shore up support and resources from Moscow.

# Appointment and Removal Process for the Head of the Chechen Republic: A Comprehensive Analysis of Ramzan Kadyrov’s Tenure and Kremlin Influence  

The Head of the Chechen Republic, as the highest executive authority in the region, has operated under a unique political framework shaped by federal laws, constitutional amendments, and direct Kremlin intervention since 2003. This report examines the formal procedures for appointment and removal, with a focus on Ramzan Kadyrov’s tenure (2007–present), and analyzes the Kremlin’s role in shaping these outcomes.  

---

## Constitutional Framework and Evolution of the Appointment Process  

### Legal Foundations Under the 2003 Constitution  
The Constitution of the Chechen Republic, adopted in 2003 after a referendum, established the presidency as a dual head of state and government[1][4]. Key provisions included:  
- **Election by popular vote**: The president was initially elected through direct universal suffrage for a four-year term, renewable once[4][17].  
- **Eligibility criteria**: Candidates must be at least 30 years old, Russian citizens, and not hold simultaneous legislative positions[1][4].  
- **Temporary succession**: If elections failed, power temporarily transferred to the parliamentary chairman until new elections within six months[4].  

This framework aligned with federal laws but retained nominal autonomy. However, the 2007 constitutional referendum extended the term to five years and removed term limits, enabling indefinite re-election[1][4].  

### Shift to Kremlin-Appointed Leadership  
Following federal reforms in 2004, Russia transitioned to a system where regional leaders were nominated by the president and ratified by regional legislatures[9][11][13]. In Chechnya, this process became a formality, as the Kremlin’s nominees faced no substantive opposition. For example:  
- The 2003 presidential election, which installed Akhmad Kadyrov, was marred by allegations of coercion, media control, and the withdrawal of opposition candidates[17][18].  
- After Akhmad’s assassination in 2004, his successor, Alu Alkhanov, was effectively a placeholder until Ramzan Kadyrov reached the minimum age of 30[1][16].  

---

## Transition to Ramzan Kadyrov’s Leadership (2007)  

### Kremlin-Led Removal of Alu Alkhanov  
Alu Alkhanov’s tenure as president (2004–2007) coincided with Ramzan Kadyrov’s rise as prime minister. Tensions between the two culminated in February 2007, when Vladimir Putin dismissed Alkhanov and appointed Ramzan as acting head[2][16]. The Chechen parliament ratified this decision within days, despite procedural requirements for multiple candidates[3][14]. Analysts noted that Alkhanov’s “voluntary” resignation and subsequent federal appointment were orchestrated to avoid public dissent[16].  

### Formal Confirmation and Consolidation of Power  
Ramzan Kadyrov’s confirmation on 5 April 2007 marked the culmination of a Kremlin-backed strategy to centralize authority in Chechnya[2][14]. Key steps included:  
1. **Paramilitary dominance**: Kadyrov’s private militia, the *Kadyrovtsy*, suppressed dissent and ensured political compliance[6][14].  
2. **Nepotistic appointments**: Family members and loyalists assumed critical roles in security, economy, and administration[2][14].  
3. **Constitutional amendments**: The 2007 referendum extended term limits, enabling Kadyrov’s indefinite re-election[1][4].  

---

## Tenure and Resignation Attempts: Kremlin’s Balancing Act  

### Electoral Performances and Political Control  
Kadyrov’s elections have been characterized by Soviet-style margins:  
- **2016 and 2021 victories**: He secured 97.9% and 99.7% of votes, respectively, amid reports of voter intimidation and ballot fraud[1][8].  
- **Opposition suppression**: Critics, such as Oyub Titiev of Memorial Human Rights Center, faced imprisonment or exile, ensuring no viable challengers[8].  

### Strategic Resignation Requests  
Kadyrov has repeatedly offered to resign, a tactic interpreted as loyalty signaling to the Kremlin:  
- **2023 and 2024 requests**: He cited health concerns and a desire for “new leadership,” but the Kremlin rejected these overtures[7][8].  
- **May 2025 resignation plea**: Kadyrov framed his request as a voluntary step to “ensure stability,” but Putin declined, emphasizing his continued trust[5][8]. Analysts speculate these gestures aim to extract concessions, such as federal guarantees for his family’s political future[12].  

### Health and Succession Planning  
Persistent rumors about Kadyrov’s declining health (e.g., kidney disease) have intensified discussions about succession[12]. Potential scenarios include:  
- **Family succession**: Son Adam Kadyrov (b. 2007) or nephew Khalid Kadyrov[12].  
- **Kremlin-appointed loyalist**: A figure like Deputy Prime Minister Magomed Daudov, ensuring continuity of Moscow’s policies[8].  

---

## Kremlin’s Mechanisms of Influence  

### Legal and Informal Levers  
1. **Constitutional overrides**: The 2007 term-limit removal and federal authority to dissolve regional legislatures ensure compliance[1][11].  
2. **Financial control**: Chechnya’s budget relies on federal subsidies (≈80% of revenue), granting Moscow leverage over policy[9][11].  
3. **Security apparatus**: Federal forces tolerate Kadyrov’s paramilitaries in exchange for counterterrorism cooperation, creating mutual dependence[6][14].  

### Case Study: The 2021 Election  
The 2021 presidential election exemplified Kremlin orchestration:  
- **Pre-approved candidates**: Opponents like Isa Khadzhimuradov (Just Russia) and Khalid Nakayev (Communist Party) were non-threatening proxies[1].  
- **Turnout manipulation**: Officially reported 94.61% turnout, despite independent observations of empty polling stations[1][8].  

---

## Conclusion: A Symbiotic Autocracy  
Ramzan Kadyrov’s tenure reflects a hybrid model of governance where formal republican structures mask centralized Kremlin control. His appointment, retention, and symbolic resignation attempts underscore Moscow’s priority: stability in a historically volatile region. While the 2003 constitutional framework remains nominally intact, its subversion through federal interventions illustrates the fragility of Chechen autonomy. Future transitions will likely hinge on the Kremlin’s assessment of Kadyrov’s utility versus the risks of succession uncertainty.

<Summary source="https://oc-media.org/kadyrov-asks-to-be-relieved-of-his-duties/">
Here is a summary of the OC Media article “Kadyrov asks to be relieved of his duties” (May 6, 2025):

Key Facts and Chronology  
• On May 5, 2025, Ramzan Kadyrov publicly stated (via local news agency Chechnya Today) that he has formally asked to be relieved of his post as Head of the Chechen Republic and “hopes [his] request will be supported,” without specifying by whom.  
• Kadyrov has held the position since April 2007. In April 2021 he became Russia’s longest-serving governor; in September 2021 he was reelected to a new five-year term with 99.7 % of the vote (an election observers criticized as a “forced vote”).  
• Since February 2025, according to unnamed sources within the Chechen government cited by Novaya Gazeta, Kadyrov has largely withdrawn from day-to-day governance. His duties have reportedly been handled by Magomed Daudov, head of the Chechen government.  
• In February 2025 Kadyrov underwent weeks of medical treatment at his wife’s private clinic in Grozny; the administration is said to have released staged footage to conceal his absence, and observers noted he appeared unwell at a university rector’s funeral.  

Repeated Public Statements on Stepping Down  
• 2022: Kadyrov said he had “overstayed [his] welcome” and wanted an “indefinite and long holiday,” but later suggested postponing any resignation talks and noted he must consult Chechen citizens and President Putin.  
• July 2023: He announced his intention to run again, stating “if the people elect me, I will continue to work” and that no successor was being sought.  

Emerging Succession Preparations  
• A public campaign has promoted Kadyrov’s 17-year-old son Adam as a potential successor.  
• Portraits of Adam have appeared in schools and administrative buildings; Daudov and pro-government Telegram channels regularly spotlight him in uniform and armed settings.  
• September 2023: Adam was filmed beating a detainee; despite public outcry he was awarded “Hero of Chechnya” in 2024 and appointed his father’s security aide.  
• March 2025: Adam was named supervisor of the Chechen Ministry of Internal Affairs (a newly created post) and, on April 22, secretary of the Chechen Security Council.  

Analyses and Competing Narratives  
• Novaya Gazeta Europe concludes that both the Kremlin and Kadyrov’s inner circle may no longer expect Ramzan Kadyrov to remain long term, and that a transition of formal power is underway.  
• Independent outlet iStories and several Telegram channels report a rift between Kadyrov and Putin—allegedly over Kadyrov’s unsanctioned talks with Gulf states (mainly Qatar) concerning his assets and family security. They cite:  
  – The sudden disappearance of Kadyrov ally Adam Delimkhanov from public view  
  – Resignation of Kadyrov’s daughter Aishat as deputy prime minister  
  – Alleged Kremlin refusal to back Adam Kadyrov as de facto successor  
• Novaya Gazeta Europe disputes the rift narrative, arguing instead that Kadyrov’s real project is to entrench family control over Chechnya’s security services and economy. According to their investigation, he has spent two years securing from Moscow personal guarantees for his children; if successful, any formally appointed head would wield little real power.

Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the extracted Novaya Gazeta Europe article and omits any outside knowledge.

Key facts and developments  
• Kremlin concern: Behind the scenes, Moscow is preparing for the sudden need to replace Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, whose severe and chronic health problems have intensified over the past year.  
• Heir apparent spotlighted: At the December 2024 United Russia congress in Moscow, Apti Alaudinov—commander of the Chechen “Akhmat” volunteer unit—spoke on the main stage in place of Kadyrov.  
  – Alaudinov, a Hero of Russia veteran from Ukraine, delivered a calm, note-free speech in unaccented Russian, referencing “god” five times and “Allah” once, projecting a “civilised” image.  
  – Career leap: February 2025 graduate of the Russian General Staff Academy; April 2025 appointment to the Defence Ministry despite no prior formal army posts.  
  – Early April 2025: Oversaw the formal transfer of Wagner Group remnants into Akhmat special forces at Kadyrov’s announcement.  
  – By Putin’s personal order, Alaudinov was made deputy head of the Main Directorate for Military and Political Work at the Defence Ministry—a signal the Kremlin may be grooming him as Kadyrov’s successor.  

Kadyrov’s health trajectory  
• January 2019: Diagnosed with pancreatic necrosis (complication of acute pancreatitis); publicly acknowledged being “temporarily unable to work.”  
• October 2019: Absent from a National Anti-Terrorist Committee meeting attended by all other regional heads.  
  – Rumours of poisoning circulated via the SKFO Telegraph (anonymous Telegram channel); promptly denied by Kadyrov aide Akhmed Dudaev.  
• 2022–early 2023: Rapid weight gain due to kidney failure and fluid accumulation (ascites and pulmonary edema) became publicly evident—breathlessness, swollen abdomen, slow gait, overdressing for the climate.  
  – Dmitry Medvedev’s winter 2024 Grozny visit highlighted Kadyrov’s visibly enlarged midsection.  
• September 2023 health crisis:  
  – NIYSO (another anonymous Chechen Telegram channel) reported Kadyrov in a coma in Moscow Central Clinical Hospital ICU.  
  – Novaya Europe’s sources say he suffered acute respiratory failure after overdosing on Dormicum (a sedative used for chronic pain and insomnia), was placed on a ventilator and medically induced coma. His life was not in immediate danger, but he remained hospitalized longer than usual.  
  – To counter the coma rumours, on 20 September a video surfaced of Kadyrov visiting his uncle Magomed in hospital—but Kadyrov appeared barely able to move, silent, while aides spoke for him.  
  – At his public re-emergence (mosque opening) later that month, Magomed looked healthy in contrast to an obviously unwell Kadyrov.  

Inner-circle assessments and PR response  
• MRI results in September reportedly alarmed Kadyrov’s inner circle. An associate close to Adam Delimkhanov told Novaya Europe that post-coma, Kadyrov “wouldn’t be the same” and might be “neither alive nor dead.”  
• Kremlin-orchestrated PR campaign followed:  
  – High-level photo-ops and meetings with President Putin involving first Kadyrov’s son Akhmat, then Kadyrov himself, aimed to project strength and normalcy.  
  – Revival of the Nikita Zhuravel “Quran-burning” case: moved to Chechnya by Investigative Committee head Alexander Bastrykin, Zhuravel was beaten by Kadyrov’s son Adam in August 2024. Publishing the beating footage and awarding Adam Kadyrov titles served as a deliberate distraction from questions about Ramzan’s health.  
  – Upon Kadyrov’s late-September return to Grozny, Chechen state media staged a marathon of public openings, ribbon-cuttings, and award ceremonies to reinforce an image of vitality.  

Implications  
• Despite the PR efforts, Kadyrov’s serious and relapsing health issues remain a significant political liability for the Kremlin.  
• The rapid elevation of Apti Alaudinov to high Defence Ministry rank is widely interpreted (including by Novaya Europe) as evidence the Kremlin is already lining up a contingency successor to ensure continuity of power in Chechnya.

<Summary source="https://www.newsweek.com/kadyrov-asks-putin-relieved-his-duties-2068556">
Here is a concise extraction of the key points from the Newsweek article “Kadyrov asks Putin to be ‘relieved’ of his duties” (May 6, 2025; Shane Croucher):

Facts & Developments  
• Ramzan Kadyrov (48) told state media he has formally “asked to be relieved of my post” as Head of the Chechen Republic amid swirling rumors about his health.  
• Appointed by Vladimir Putin in 2007 after his father’s assassination, Kadyrov has led Chechnya for nearly 18 years.  
• According to Novaya Gazeta Europe, he is preparing his 17-year-old son Adam as his successor.  

Named Sources & Quotes  
• Government-run Chechnya Today quotes Kadyrov: “On the contrary, I myself ask to be relieved of my post. The other will have his own initiatives, his own vision. I hope that my request will be supported.”  
• In a later Telegram post, Kadyrov walked back any personal authority to step down:  
  – “I do not decide whether I will remain…only one person—our Supreme Commander-in-Chief, President…Putin.”  
  – “I am an infantryman! I am a team person. If there is an order, I carry it out.”  
• Reuters (citing Rossiya 1, 2017) reported Kadyrov then saying resignation was “my dream,” arguing his work in restoring order is now complete.  

Background & Context  
• Kadyrov’s rule is marked by tight security, ongoing clashes with rebels/extremists, and allegations by human-rights groups of torture and extrajudicial killings.  
• His private militia, the “Kadyrovtsy,” has deployed fighters to support Russia in Ukraine and backed Assad in Syria.  
• He has positioned himself as a bridge to the Muslim world—advocating Islamic banking in Russia and leading diplomatic outreach in the Middle East.  

No independent confirmation of Kadyrov’s health rumors or any Kremlin response to his request was reported in this update.

Disclaimer: The source (Baku.ws) is not a major international outlet; see notes on reliability below.

Key Facts
- On an unspecified date, Ramzan Kadyrov told the regional news agency “Chechnya Today” that he has formally asked to be relieved of his duties as Head of the Chechen Republic.
- He did not name the recipient of his request (e.g., the Kremlin or the Russian president).
- Kadyrov said someone else will have “their own initiatives, their own vision,” and expressed hope his request will be supported.
- He briefly addressed the idea of a successor but gave no details.
- He reiterated a previous denial of health‐related rumors, noting that “the internet regularly attributes various illnesses” to him.
- (Unrelatedly, the article mentions the ICAO Council has officially held Russia responsible for the MH17 disaster over Ukraine—this appears out of context.)

Opinions and Attributions
- Kadyrov’s own statements (via “Chechnya Today”):  
  • “I myself am asking to be relieved of my position.”  
  • He hopes his request will be granted.  
  • Denial of health‐problem rumors as fabrications of the online “information space.”
- Unnamed “rumors circulating in the information space” claim he might resign (origin not specified; lower reliability).

Source Reliability
- Quotes attributed to “Chechnya Today” (state‐linked regional news agency) are reasonably credible for Kadyrov’s publicly stated intentions.
- Baku.ws: a regional news aggregator of variable reliability; factual claims should ideally be cross-checked with independent outlets.
- Unspecified “internet” rumors and “information space” claims are low reliability.

   - Explains constitutional framework and Putin's role in appointment/removal
   - Compilation of multiple sources with good historical context

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several potential reference classes:

1. **Kadyrov's previous resignation requests**: Most directly relevant—he has requested resignation at least three times before (2020, 2023, 2024) with 0/3 resulting in actual departure.

2. **Russian regional leaders removed after resignation requests**: Less specific but potentially informative—the Kremlin often orchestrates "voluntary" resignations of regional leaders.

3. **Russian leaders with serious health issues**: Relevant given Kadyrov's reported pancreatic necrosis, but health impacts are hard to predict in short timeframes.

4. **Leaders who publicly indicate resignation but remain**: Political leaders often use resignation threats as negotiation tactics.

The most suitable reference class is Kadyrov's own previous resignation requests, as this provides direct insight into the pattern and outcomes specific to this situation. Secondary consideration should be given to his health situation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is very short: May 12, 2025, to June 1, 2025 (20 days).

Historical patterns relevant to this timeframe:
- None of Kadyrov's previous resignation requests led to his departure
- The most recent development (May 7-8) was his meeting with Putin, after which he indicated he would continue in his role
- No leadership transition in Chechnya has occurred on such a short timeline since Kadyrov took power in 2007
- Political transitions in Russia, especially for strategically important regions like Chechnya, typically take months to orchestrate

## (d) Justification

Integrating the above analyses:

1. **Pattern of unfulfilled resignation requests**: Kadyrov has made at least three previous resignation requests (2020, 2023, 2024) without stepping down. This established pattern strongly suggests the current instance will follow suit.

2. **Recent Putin meeting**: Multiple sources confirm Kadyrov met with Putin on May 7-8, after which Kadyrov backtracked and indicated he would continue serving. This very recent development substantially reduces the likelihood of departure in the next 20 days.

3. **Expert assessment**: Harold Chambers and other analysts view these resignation requests as tactical maneuvers to extract concessions from Moscow, not genuine intentions to step down.

4. **Health considerations**: Multiple sources mention Kadyrov's serious health issues (pancreatic necrosis), introducing a non-zero chance of health-related incapacitation or death within the timeframe.

5. **Timeframe constraints**: With only 20 days remaining, there is limited time for a leadership transition, especially given the apparent resolution after the Putin meeting.

6. **Constitutional framework**: As detailed in the Perplexity report, Kadyrov's removal would require Putin's explicit approval, which was apparently withheld in their recent meeting.

7. **Strategic importance**: Chechnya's stability under Kadyrov is strategically valuable to Putin, making any transition a carefully managed process unlikely to occur hastily.

The strongest evidence points to Kadyrov remaining in power through June 1. His pattern of previous unfulfilled resignation requests, expert analysis of his tactical motives, and especially the very recent meeting with Putin after which he backtracked, all suggest this is another instance of resignation theater rather than a genuine transition.

The main uncertainty factor is his health, which could potentially force a transition regardless of political factors. However, even with serious health issues, the short timeframe makes a complete leadership transition before June 1 unlikely.

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I'll start with the reference class of Kadyrov's previous resignation requests, which have a 0% rate of leading to actual resignation (0 out of 3 previous instances). This suggests a very low probability.

However, I must account for his reported serious health condition. Sources mention pancreatic necrosis with a 79.1% one-year mortality rate in Russia. While concerning, this mortality rate applies over a full year, not a 20-day period. The probability of mortality or incapacitation within just 20 days would be significantly lower.

The most compelling evidence is the May 7-8 meeting with Putin, after which Kadyrov explicitly backtracked on resignation talk. This very recent development strongly suggests status quo will continue at least through the short forecast period.

Given these factors, I assess:
- Base rate from previous resignation requests: ~0% probability of resignation
- Adjustment for health concerns: Small increase (1-3%)
- Adjustment for very recent Putin meeting: Strong decrease in probability
- Consideration of 20-day timeframe: Further decrease in probability

Weighing these factors, I estimate approximately a 3% chance that Kadyrov will cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025.

   - Quality: Limited information; relies on Nexta Live reporting
   - Expert opinions: None provided

5. **AOL article (May 5, 2025)**
   - Factual: Confirms Kadyrov's resignation request; notes his 99.73% victory in 2021; appointed 17-year-old son to security role
   - Quality: News aggregator with factual reporting consistent with other sources

6. **Perplexity report on appointment/removal process**
   - Factual: Comprehensive overview of Chechen leadership framework; Kadyrov's previous resignation requests (2023, 2024, May 2025)
   - Quality: Well-cited secondary source compilation
   - Expert opinions: References multiple analysts on Kremlin control mechanisms

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Potential reference classes:
1. **Kadyrov's previous resignation requests** (Jan 2020, Mar 2023, Jun 2024, May 2025) - None resulted in actual resignation
2. **Russian regional leaders with health problems** - Limited data but occasional replacements
3. **Authoritarian leaders signaling retirement** - Often remain in power (e.g., Putin)
4. **Leaders with pancreatic necrosis** - High mortality but variable timeframes

Most suitable reference class: Kadyrov's own previous resignation requests provides the most directly applicable historical pattern (0 for 3 led to actual departure).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is extremely short - just 19 days from today (May 12) until June 1, 2025.

Historical patterns relevant to this timeframe:
- Kadyrov has ruled continuously since 2007 (18 years)
- His most recent meeting with Putin (May 8, 2025) resulted in apparent reaffirmation of support
- No scheduled elections or transitions are occurring within this period
- The three previous resignation requests were separated by ~14-16 months, suggesting a cyclical pattern rather than escalating instability

## (d) Justification

The short timeframe significantly constrains the probability of Kadyrov's departure. For him to leave office before June 1, one of three scenarios must occur:

1. **Health crisis**: The most plausible pathway given reports of pancreatic necrosis. However, Kadyrov has apparently survived with this condition since at least 2019, suggesting either misdiagnosis, successful treatment, or exceptional resilience.

2. **Putin's decision**: The most recent information (May 8) indicates Putin's continued support. Given Russia's wartime footing and history of maintaining stability in Chechnya, a sudden reversal within 19 days appears highly unlikely without extraordinary circumstances.

3. **Voluntary departure**: Kadyrov's pattern of requesting resignation followed by continued service suggests these are political maneuvers rather than genuine intent to leave.

Additional factors supporting continuity:
- Kadyrov's son is only 17 and seemingly being groomed for eventual succession
- The complex security situation described (deployed Kadyrovites in Ukraine, potential instability in transition) makes an abrupt leadership change risky
- The predictable cycle of resignation requests followed by renewed support appears to be a loyalty-signaling mechanism

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I'll consider the specific timeframe and known mortality rates.

If Kadyrov truly has pancreatic necrosis with a 79.1% one-year mortality in Russia (as reported), we can roughly calculate a 3-week mortality risk. Converting the annual mortality: 1-(1-0.791)^(3/52) ≈ 7.8% probability of death within 3 weeks.

However, this calculation assumes:
1. The diagnosis is accurate and current
2. He was newly diagnosed (whereas sources suggest he's had this condition for years)
3. Death is the only way he would leave office

The reference class of his previous resignation requests (0 successes from 3 attempts) suggests near-zero probability of voluntary departure. Political removal appears equally unlikely given Putin's May 8 expression of support.

The calculated health risk must be further discounted because:
- He has survived years with this condition, suggesting better-than-average prognosis
- Medical capacity for high-level officials exceeds typical Russian healthcare
- Not all health deteriorations would immediately trigger removal from office

1. Source analysis  
   a. Jamestown Foundation (May 5, 2025)  
      – Type: Policy‐focused think tank. Generally reliable on North Caucasus but occasional editorial bias.  
      – Facts: Kadyrov submitted fourth resignation request on May 5; Putin had not publicly agreed; reported Kremlin refusal on May 7.  
      – Opinions: Motives (“bid for Kremlin backing”), health prognosis (79.1% one-year mortality) attributed to published studies—reasonable factual basis.  
   b. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL, June 25 2021)  
      – Type: U.S.-funded broadcaster, credible but proscribed by Russia. Historical background on 2021 re-election.  
      – Facts: Kadyrov’s 98–99% “election” wins; orchestrated rallies; human-rights abuses.  
      – Opinions: Quotes of third-party analysts; clearly attributed.  
   c. The Moscow Times (May 8 2025)  
      – Type: Independent Russian-language outlet; reliable reporting, some anecdotal elements.  
      – Facts: Kadyrov met Putin on May 8 and publicly announced “full understanding and support.”  
      – Opinions: Analysts’ interpretations of Kadyrov’s tactics; attributed to unnamed “some analysts.”  
   d. Newshub.ge (May 6 2025, via Nexta Live)  
      – Type: Regional aggregator; less transparent sourcing.  
      – Facts: Kadyrov told journalists on May 6 that he “wants to step down” and hopes Putin will grant it.  
      – Opinions: Kadyrov’s own framing; no independent verification.  
   e. AOL News (May 5 2025)  
      – Type: Aggregated press‐wire style; moderate reliability.  
      – Facts: Kadyrov’s May 5 remarks to Chechnya Today; mention of his son’s promotion.  
      – Opinions: Health rumors, Western NGO reports—attributed where possible.  
   f. The Moscow Times (May 6 2025)  
      – Type: As above.  
      – Facts: Kadyrov’s public resignation plea on May 6; subsequent Telegram post deferring to Putin.  
      – Opinions: Analysis by Harold Chambers (Caucasus researcher); well attributed.  
   g. Perplexity report on appointment/removal process  
      – Type: Automated synthesis drawing on Wikipedia and think-tank reports; broad historical overview.  
      – Facts: Constitutional changes since 2003; Kremlin’s control levers; Kadyrov’s 2007 rise.  
      – Opinions: Characterization of “hybrid autocracy,” drawn from secondary sources—useful but treat analysis cautiously.

2. Reference‐class analysis  
   Possible classes:  
   – Kadyrov’s own prior resignation requests (Jan 2020, Mar 2023, Jun 2024). Outcome: 0/3 removed.  
   – Kremlin‐appointed regional heads under Putin who resigned or were removed within ~30 days of publicly asking to step down. Sample size tiny; anecdotal evidence suggests virtually none.  
   – Long‐standing authoritarian regional strongmen globally making public resignation bids within one month of actual departure. Again, low frequency.  
   Suitability: The most direct and largest-n N reference class is Kadyrov’s 3 prior resignation requests—all rebuffed. This yields a base rate of 0% for departure following a public request.

3. Time-frame analysis  
   – Time remaining until resolution: ~20 days (May 12 to June 1, 2025).  
   – Historical patterns: Even genuinely forced resignations in Russia’s regions unfold over months after a Kremlin decision; immediate removals are rare unless tied to a dramatic scandal or coup. Kadyrov’s situation involves complex patronage and security considerations, making a rapid dismissal within 20 days especially unlikely.

4. Additional factors  
   – Putin’s public support as of May 8: strong signal against imminent removal.  
   – Kadyrov’s health: poor prognosis could precipitate sudden incapacity—but public messaging and paramilitary role suggest he will be kept in office unless incapacitated.  
   – Kremlin calculus: removing Kadyrov risks destabilizing Chechnya and exposing federal weakness. Unless forced by an unforeseen health crisis, Moscow is incentivized to maintain the status quo through June 1.

5. Justification for outside-view prediction  
   – Base rate from Kadyrov’s own history: 0%.  
   – Adjust for small probability of a sudden health crisis or last-minute Kremlin decision: even generous overlay only moves probability into low single digits.  
   – Short resolution window (20 days) further compresses chances.  
   – Public messaging (May 8 meeting) reinforces status quo through at least June.  

Outside view calibration:  
Given a base rate of 0% from prior analogous events and allowance for unforeseen accelerants (health emergency, Kremlin strategic shock), a reasonable outside-view probability is in the 1–7% range. Small absolute changes are meaningful; I center near the midpoint.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 5% chance that Ramzan Kadyrov will cease to be Head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. Jamestown Foundation (May 5, 2025)  
     – Factuals: Kadyrov formally asked Putin to relieve him of his post (fourth such request); Putin reportedly turned him down on May 7; Kadyrov’s health reportedly poor.  
     – Opinions: Observers suspect the request is a ploy to extract Kremlin support; unverified health-mortality statistics.  
     – Credibility: Jamestown is a respected policy‐research outlet; the basic facts of the resignation request and Putin’s refusal are corroborated by multiple outlets.  
   b. RFE/RL (June 2021)  
     – Factuals: Kadyrov’s history of near‐unanimous “elections,” Kremlin backing, and human‐rights abuses.  
     – Opinions: Congress attendance portrayed as phony; quoted analysts on electoral fraud.  
     – Relevance: Historical background on Kadyrov’s entrenched position, but minimal bearing on near‐term resignation dynamics.  
   c. The Moscow Times (May 6 & May 8, 2025)  
     – Factuals: Kadyrov publicly reiterated his request to step down; on May 8 he met Putin and announced full Kremlin support.  
     – Opinions: Speculation that he uses retirement talk to extract guarantees; unnamed analysts’ views on his “unauthorized” outreach.  
     – Credibility: Independent outlet (albeit labelled “undesirable” by Russia); direct quotes from Kadyrov’s Telegram, meeting reports.  
   d. Newshub.ge (May 6, 2025) & AOL (May 5, 2025)  
     – Factuals: Kadyrov’s statements about long‐standing desire to be relieved, but stressing only Putin can decide.  
     – Opinions: None from named experts; some second‐hand health rumors.  
     – Credibility: Offshoots of state‐oriented reporting; core quotes match other sources.  
   e. Perplexity report (process summary)  
     – Factuals: Constitutional and procedural history of Chechnya’s headship; prior resignations and Kremlin interventions.  
     – Opinions: Synthesized from diverse sources; useful for context but secondary to real‐time reports.  
     – Credibility: Mixed—aggregates public‐domain info, likely reliable on formal procedures but not on current politics.

2. Reference‐class analysis  
   – Possible reference classes:  
     a. Tenure stability of Russian federal subjects’ governors/heads (2000–2025).  
     b. Incumbent regional leaders who have publicly asked to resign and were granted removal within six weeks.  
     c. Powerful appointees with personal militias (e.g., Kadyrov‐style “strongmen”).  
   – Suitability: (a) provides robust annual turnover baseline; (b) is directly analogous but N≈0 (no precedents); (c) yields too small an N.  
   – Chosen reference class: turnover rates of Russian regional heads. According to open‐source compilations, roughly 2–3 governor‐level changes occur per year across 80+ regions (≈2.5% annual rate). Chechnya has been an extreme outlier of stability since 2007.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Forecast window: 20 days (May 12–June 1, 2025).  
   – Historical pattern: Kadyrov has made four resignation requests over five years; none led to removal at all, let alone within weeks.  
   – Annual turnover → 2.5%/year ≈ 0.14% per 20‐day window. Even if Kadyrov’s request increases odds by an order of magnitude, we remain well under 2%.

4. Justification for outside view  
   – Base‐rate: Extremely low short‐term removal rate for any Russian regional head, especially one with Kadyrov’s Kremlin entrenchment.  
   – Inside cues: His May 8 meeting with Putin reaffirmed support, undermining any immediate prospects for removal.  
   – Health factor: While poor health raises long‐term uncertainty, no clear evidence suggests imminent incapacitation.  
   – Status quo: Putin values stability in Chechnya; a sudden change could trigger regional instability.  
   – Expert/market expectation: No major think‐tank or market has priced a near‐term Chechen leadership transition as likely.

Outside view calibration:  
We anchor on the 0.14% base‐rate (2.5% annual) for any governor‐level change in a 20‐day span, then modestly uplift given Kadyrov’s resignation request but offset by Putin’s explicit support. A plausible calibrated probability: 1%.

Outside View Prediction:  
1% chance that Ramzan Kadyrov ceases to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025.

   - Independent source operating in exile; labeled "undesirable" by Russia but generally reliable

2. **Yahoo News/Business Insider (May 7, 2025)**
   - Reports Kadyrov formally asked Putin for dismissal
   - Notes his private militia's role in Ukraine
   - References previous resignation hints (2016, 2022)
   - FACTUAL: Reports of pancreatic necrosis since 2019 (denied by Kadyrov)
   - Mainstream aggregator with consistent reporting

3. **OC Media (May 6, 2025)**
   - Detailed report on Kadyrov's May 5 statement
   - FACTUAL: Since February 2025, Kadyrov has withdrawn from day-to-day governance
   - Describes campaign promoting his 17-year-old son Adam
   - EXPERT OPINION: Novaya Gazeta sources suggest transition planning underway
   - Regional outlet with detailed, consistent reporting

4. **Novaya Gazeta Europe (April 23, 2024)**
   - Extensive reporting on Kadyrov's health issues since 2019
   - FACTUAL: Details medical conditions (pancreatic necrosis, kidney problems)
   - FACTUAL: Describes September 2023 health crisis with induced coma
   - Discusses Apti Alaudinov as potential Kremlin successor
   - Respected independent Russian outlet in exile, though article is from 2024

5. **Newsweek (May 6, 2025)**
   - Reports Kadyrov's resignation request and subsequent walking back
   - FACTUAL: Quotes from official Telegram posts
   - FACTUAL: Mentions son Adam as potential successor
   - Mainstream Western news source with factual reporting

6. **Baku.ws (undated)**
   - Brief report on resignation request
   - FACTUAL: Includes Kadyrov's denial of health rumors
   - Less established source but information aligns with others

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Multiple reliable sources confirm Kadyrov publicly asked to step down on May 5, 2025
- Multiple sources confirm a May 7 Putin meeting after which Kadyrov indicated continuing in role
- Documented pattern of previous unfulfilled resignation requests (2016, 2022)
- Multiple sources reference serious health issues dating to 2019 (pancreatic necrosis)

**Moderate evidence:**
- Reports of withdrawal from day-to-day governance since February 2025
- Information about successor preparation (Alaudinov by Kremlin, Adam Kadyrov by Ramzan)
- Putin's constitutional authority over Kadyrov's appointment/removal

**Weak evidence:**
- Speculation about Kadyrov-Putin tensions
- Unconfirmed severity of current health condition
- Various theories about resignation motives

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is very short: May 12 to June 1, 2025 (20 days).

This timeframe significantly impacts the forecast:
- Russian leadership transitions, especially in strategically important regions, typically take months
- The very recent Putin meeting (May 7) and subsequent statements strongly suggest no immediate change
- Even with deteriorating health, the formal replacement process would likely extend beyond June 1
- If the timeframe doubled to 40 days, probability would increase modestly
- If halved to 10 days, probability would decrease significantly

## (d) Justification

Integrating the evidence:

1. **Pattern of unfulfilled resignation requests**: This is at least Kadyrov's third or fourth public resignation overture (2016, 2022, possibly others). None resulted in his departure, establishing a strong pattern that suggests the current instance will follow suit.

2. **Very recent Putin meeting**: Just five days ago, Kadyrov met Putin and subsequently reversed course, indicating he received "full understanding and support" and would continue serving. This dramatically reduces the likelihood of departure within the next 20 days.

3. **Health considerations**: Multiple sources consistently mention pancreatic necrosis and other serious conditions. This represents the main risk factor that could lead to sudden departure through death or incapacitation.

4. **Kremlin authority**: Putin appointed Kadyrov in 2007 and would need to approve any resignation. The May 7 meeting and subsequent statements strongly suggest Putin does not currently support his departure.

5. **Succession planning**: While there are signs of preparation (promoting son Adam, possible Kremlin backing for Alaudinov), these suggest a longer-term transition rather than an imminent one.

The evidence overwhelmingly indicates Kadyrov will remain in power through June 1. His pattern of unfulfilled resignation requests, the very recent Putin meeting, and the short timeframe all point to continuity. The only significant risk factor is his health condition, which could lead to sudden incapacitation or death.

# Probability calibration

To calibrate my prediction, I'll start with the reference class of Kadyrov's previous resignation requests, which have a 0% rate of leading to actual resignation (0 out of 3+ previous instances). This suggests a very low probability.

However, I must account for his reported serious health condition. Multiple sources consistently mention pancreatic necrosis, which can be life-threatening. That said, given he's been managing this condition since at least 2019 and was able to meet with Putin on May 7, the probability of death or complete incapacitation within this specific 20-day window remains low.

The most compelling evidence is the May 7 meeting with Putin, after which Kadyrov explicitly indicated he would continue in his role. This very recent development strongly suggests the status quo will continue through the short forecast period.

Given these factors, I assess:
- Base rate from previous resignation requests: ~0-1% probability of departure
- Adjustment for health concerns: Small increase (+2-4%)
- Adjustment for very recent Putin meeting: Strong decrease (-1-2%)
- Consideration of 20-day timeframe: Further decrease (insufficient time for transition)

Weighing these factors, I estimate approximately a 3% chance that Kadyrov will cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025.

# Checklist:
1. Will Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be Head of Chechen Republic by any means before June 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: Previous Kadyrov resignation requests have 0% success rate
3. 3 out of 100 times, Kadyrov ceases to be head of Chechnya before June 1, primarily through sudden health crisis
4. Key evidence: May 7 Putin meeting with backtracking; pattern of unfulfilled resignation requests; serious but managed health issues since 2019; 20-day window insufficient for transition
5. Blind spot: Kadyrov's health could be significantly worse than publicly known
6. Status quo is Kadyrov remaining in power; short timeframe and recent developments warrant nudge toward this outcome

Probability: 3%
Predicted Probability: 3.0%

   - Type: Major US-based international news magazine
   - Quality: Reliable mainstream reporting
   - Key facts: Kadyrov (48) asked to be relieved; appointed by Putin in 2007; led Chechnya for 18 years

   - Quality: Variable reliability; requires cross-checking
   - Key facts: Kadyrov told "Chechnya Today" he asked to be relieved; denied health rumors
   - Expert opinions: None from identifiable experts

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
1. Kadyrov's public statement seeking relief from his post (confirmed by multiple independent sources)
2. Putin-Kadyrov meeting on May 7, followed by Kadyrov's claim of receiving "full understanding and support" (Moscow Times)
3. Kadyrov's historical pattern of making similar resignation requests without stepping down (2016, 2022, 2023)
4. Putin's established system of appointing and removing regional leaders, which gives him near-absolute control over Kadyrov's position

**Moderate evidence:**
1. Kadyrov's documented health problems (Novaya Gazeta Europe's investigation from 2024)
2. Preparations for succession, including promotion of Adam Kadyrov and/or grooming of Apti Alaudinov
3. Kadyrov's withdrawal from day-to-day governance since February 2025 (per Novaya Gazeta sources)

**Weak evidence:**
1. Speculation about Kadyrov's motives (tactical vs. genuine)
2. Reports of a Kadyrov-Putin rift over unsanctioned Gulf state talks
3. Unverified rumors about Kadyrov's current health status

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is short - from today (May 12, 2025) to June 1, 2025 (approximately 20 days).

If the timeframe were halved (10 days):
- Probability would decrease significantly, as even if a decision to remove Kadyrov had been made, administrative processes and political maneuvering would be difficult to complete so quickly.

If the timeframe were doubled (40 days):
- Probability would increase moderately, allowing more time for health deterioration or political arrangements to be finalized.
- Would also increase chances of unforeseen events precipitating change.

## (d) Justification

The most compelling factors affecting the prediction:

1. **Putin's apparent recent endorsement (May 7)**: The meeting and Kadyrov's claim of receiving "full understanding and support" strongly suggests no imminent removal is planned.

2. **Historical pattern of similar requests**: Kadyrov has made similar resignation requests in the past without stepping down, establishing a pattern where such requests are likely performative rather than genuine.

3. **Short timeframe**: With only 20 days until resolution, there is limited time for a carefully managed transition in this sensitive region. Given security implications, leadership changes in Chechnya would likely be planned well in advance.

4. **Health concerns**: Documented health problems could potentially force a sudden change if Kadyrov's condition deteriorates dramatically, representing the main factor that could lead to an unexpected change.

5. **Succession preparations**: The grooming of potential successors suggests preparation for eventual transition, but on a longer-term timeline rather than imminent change.

These factors suggest a low probability of Kadyrov ceasing to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025. The outside view base rate of 5% is reasonable given Kadyrov's history of making resignation requests without stepping down, combined with Putin's apparent recent endorsement.

# Probability calibration

Given the strong evidence of Putin's very recent meeting with Kadyrov (May 7) and subsequent claims of support, I would adjust the outside view probability slightly downward. The extremely short timeframe (20 days) makes a planned transition highly unlikely given the complexity of Chechen politics and security arrangements.

Kadyrov's documented health issues create a small but real possibility of sudden incapacitation that could force a change, but there's no evidence of immediate deterioration that would necessitate this within the 20-day window.

The consistent pattern of previous resignation requests without actual departures strongly suggests this is another case of political maneuvering rather than genuine intent to leave office.

I assess there is a 4% probability that Kadyrov will cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025.

# Checklist:
1. Will Ramzan Kadyrov stop being Head of Chechnya for any reason before June 1, 2025 (~20 days from now)?
2. Outside view: 5% chance based on historical resignation requests and regional leadership patterns
3. 4 out of 100 times, Kadyrov would cease being Chechen head within ~20 days of a situation like current one
4. Key evidence: May 7 Putin meeting with "full support"; pattern of unfulfilled resignation requests; short 20-day timeframe; documented health issues
5. Blind spot: Undetected serious health deterioration requiring immediate step-down
6. Status quo strongly favors Kadyrov remaining in power through June 1

Probability: 4%
Predicted Probability: 4.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Jamestown Foundation (May 5, 2025)  
   – Facts: Kadyrov formally asked Putin to relieve him of his post; Putin declined on May 7; notes severe pancreatic necrosis with ~79% one‐year mortality in Russia.  
   – Quality: Reputable Eurasia-focused think tank, well‐sourced though mortality statistic is broad.  
   – Opinions: Analysts speculate on succession (Apti Alaudinov, Kadyrov’s children). Credible but not definitive.  

2. RFE/RL (June 25, 2021)  
   – Facts: In 2016 Kadyrov feigned retirement before re-election; won with 98% of vote.  
   – Quality: Reliable US-funded broadcaster with strong track record on Russian affairs; labeled “undesirable” by Russia but factual reporting.  
   – Opinions: Chechen diaspora leaders on legitimacy of Kadyrov’s support. Useful context but dated.  

3. The Moscow Times (May 6 & 8, 2025)  
   – Facts: On May 5 Kadyrov asked to step down, then on May 7 met Putin who “gave full support.” Kadyrov publicly backed away from resignation talk.  
   – Quality: Independent but “undesirable” in Russia; consistently reliable on Kremlin dynamics.  
   – Opinions: Unnamed analysts view resignation threats as tactical leverage. Plausible.  

4. Newshub.ge (May 6, 2025)  
   – Facts: Confirms Kadyrov’s resignation request.  
   – Quality: Secondary aggregator relying on Nexta Live; no expert commentary. Low to moderate reliability on facts.  

5. AOL/NBC (May 5, 2025)  
   – Facts: Kadyrov asked Putin to relieve him; notes 99.73% vote in 2021; son Adam’s security appointment.  
   – Quality: Aggregator but cross-checks well with other outlets. Factual.  
   – Opinions: Cites Human Rights Watch on election quality.  

6. Perplexity report (various dates)  
   – Facts: Compiles Kadyrov’s retirement bids (2022, 2023, May 2025), explains Chechen institutional structure.  
   – Quality: Secondary compilation; generally reliable but should be confirmed.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
1. Putin’s public support (Moscow Times, Jamestown) – Strong evidence for continuity; multiple independent, reliable sources.  
2. Historical pattern of feigned retirements (RFE/RL; multiple dates) – Strong: Kadyrov has twice before threatened to resign and stayed.  
3. Serious chronic health issues (Jamestown; Novaya Gazeta Europe background) – Moderate: health is dire but long-standing, survival beyond initial diagnosis.  
4. Grooming of successors (OC Media, Novaya Gazeta Europe) – Moderate: signals transition plan but no immediate power handover.  
5. Time window is extremely short (20 days) – Strong: abrupt removal requires exceptional event.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
– Today is May 12, 2025; resolution date June 1, 2025 → 20 days.  
– If window were half (~10 days), probability would shrink further (~2–3%) because even health crises can take weeks.  
– If window doubled (~40 days), modest increase (~6–8%), largely reflecting health risk.  

(d) Justification  
Outside view base rate: Kadyrov has threatened resignation 3 times (2016, 2022, 2025) with no departure → implied 0% success historically.  
Adjustments:  
– Health: Annual mortality ~79% → ~7.8% risk over 3 weeks. But he’s lived with this for years and enjoys top-tier medical care → discount to ~4%.  
– Political: Putin’s reaffirmed support on May 8 makes forced removal or allowed departure extremely unlikely → <1%.  
– Voluntary: Past threats as bargaining tactics → negligible (<1%).  

Combine health (~4%) + other pathways (~1%) → ~5% total. Given uncertainties and possible overestimation of mortality, I lean toward the lower end of that range.

Probability calibration  
I adjust my prior (4%) slightly upward to account for the credible, high mortality estimate, then discount for his survival thus far. Final inside‐view probability: 5%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be Head of Chechnya by June 1, 2025?  
2. Base rate: 0% past resignations succeeded; typical authoritarian leaders don’t depart abruptly.  
3. Consistency: “5 out of 100 times, Kadyrov leaves by June 1.” Reflects small health‐driven risk plus negligible political risk.  
4. Top evidence:  
   a. Putin’s public support (strong)  
   b. Chronic health with high mortality rate (moderate)  
   c. Historical resignation feints (strong)  
5. Blind spot: Sudden violent event (assassination, coup) could spike probability unexpectedly.  
6. Status quo: Likely remains in power; situation stable absent crisis.

Probability: 5%
Predicted Probability: 5.0%

Output:
Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Jamestown Foundation (May 5, 2025) – Reliable policy think-tank. Reports Kadyrov’s formal resignation request and Putin’s refusal. Factuals from Chechnya Today; experts speculate tactical motives.  
2. The Moscow Times (May 8, 2025) – Independent, albeit “undesirable” in Russia. Confirms Kadyrov–Putin meeting and Kremlin backing. Quotes from Kadyrov’s Telegram.  
3. OC Media (May 6, 2025) – Regional outlet of moderate reliability. Documents Kadyrov’s withdrawal from duties, health treatments, and son-succession campaign. Cites Novaya Gazeta, iStories.  
4. Novaya Gazeta Europe (April 23, 2024) – Investigative outlet. Details Kadyrov’s chronic health issues and grooming of Apti Alaudinov. Historical with strong sourcing.  
5. Newsweek (May 6, 2025) – Mainstream. Repeats Kadyrov’s request and walk-back. No new forecasting cues.  
6. Baku.ws (undated) – Low reliability. Confirms Kadyrov’s request only. No unique insights.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Kremlin support (Moscow Times): Putin met Kadyrov May 7 and publicly “understands and supports” him, undercutting a removal.  
• Historical tenure stability (Novaya Europe; reference class): No previous short-term removal; Chechnya an extreme outlier of stability since 2007.  
Moderate evidence  
• Repeated resignation requests (Jamestown, OC Media): Four prior requests with no effect—shows pattern but signals possible long-term shift.  
• Succession grooming (OC Media, Novaya Europe): Adam Kadyrov and Alaudinov elevated—indicates contingency planning but not immediate handover.  
Weak evidence  
• Health rumors (Novaya Europe, OC Media): Chronic issues and hospital stays raise long-term uncertainty but no sign of imminent incapacity.  
• Unverified tensions with Putin (The Moscow Times, OC Media): Reports of unsanctioned Gulf talks—could erode trust but no concrete Kremlin action yet.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 20 days (May 12–June 1, 2025).  
– Halved (10 days): Even lower odds (<1%)—too little time for Kremlin to finalize removal.  
– Doubled (40 days): Slightly higher odds (~2%) but still constrained by Putin’s reaffirmed support and procedural inertia.

(d) Justification & inside‐view adjustment  
Base‐rate (outside view): ~0.14% chance of any regional‐head turnover in a 20-day window (2.5% annual rate).  
Inside cues: Kadyrov’s public resignation request would boost odds, but Putin’s May 7 endorsement and Chechnya’s stability strongly counteract this. No firm evidence of an imminent health collapse or Kremlin directive to replace him.  
Calibration: Uplift base‐rate by ~7× for the unusual request, but offset by Putin’s support → ~1%.

Probability calibration  
Given the extremely low reference‐class turnover, Kadyrov’s entrenched position, and recent Putin backing, a ~1% probability best reflects the true odds. A ±1% shift would significantly change implied odds (e.g., 2% is 50:1 against), so we keep probability low.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Kadyrov cease as Chechen head before June 1, 2025? Yes/no by credible reports, within 20 days.  
2. Outside view base rate: ~0.14% for any regional head turnover in 20 days.  
3. Consistency: “1 out of 100 times, Kadyrov steps down before June 1, 2025.” Aligns with his Kremlin protection and tenure.  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Putin’s public support (strong).  
   • Historical stability of Chechen leadership (strong).  
   • Multiple failed prior resignation bids (moderate).  
   • Succession grooming but no formal handover (moderate).  
   • Chronic health but no collapse (weak).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden health crisis or Kremlin purge (e.g., secret indictment) could force immediate removal—unlikely but would upset the forecast.  
6. Status quo: The status quo is extremely stable; absent a major shock, Kadyrov stays.  

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Moscow Times (8 May 2025). Independent, Western-based Russian outlet; usually reliable on factual Kremlin personnel news. Mostly quotes Kadyrov’s own Telegram posts and Kremlin footage (facts) + unnamed analysts’ interpretation (opinions).  
2. Yahoo News / Business Insider (7 May 2025). Relays Kyiv Independent translation of state agency “Chechnya Today”; factual quotes reliable; additional colour is journalistic opinion.  
3. OC-Media (6 May 2025). Caucasus-focused, generally credible; uses multiple primary sources (Chechnya Today, Novaya Gazeta, internal leaks). Distinguishes facts from speculation.  
4. Novaya Gazeta Europe (23 Apr 2024). Investigative reputation, anti-Kremlin; long lead time but deep sourcing on health. Good for background, less for current situational changes.  
5. Newsweek (6 May 2025). Western mainstream; re-reports the resignation request; no new primary evidence.  
6. Baku.ws (undated 2025). Regional aggregator; weakest reliability; offers no new facts beyond restating Chechnya Today quotes.

(b) Evidence analysis (re resolution: Kadyrov no longer Head before 1 Jun 2025)

Strong evidence  
• Only Putin can dismiss/accept resignation; no Kremlin decree issued (structural, high-credibility, status-quo-maintaining).  
• 18-year record of repeated “I’ll step down” statements with zero follow-through (historical pattern, high predictive power).  

Moderate evidence  
• Kadyrov’s public request to be relieved (single direct source, 6 May 2025) shows non-zero intention.  
• Persistent, multi-source reports of serious chronic illness raise non-trivial death/incapacity risk.  
• Kremlin’s visible grooming of alternatives (Alaudinov, Adam) suggests contingency planning.  

Weak evidence  
• Rumoured Putin–Kadyrov rift (anonymous Telegram, unverified).  
• Speculation that request is a bargaining tactic (analyst opinion, plausible but conjectural).

Net evidence direction: small upward pressure on the chance of a change, but strong inertia factors dominate.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining: 20 days. If horizon were doubled (40 days) I would raise odds ~1.3× (to ~15%). If halved (10 days) I’d cut odds ~0.7× (to ~8%). Short window sharply limits probability because both formal dismissal and death are low-frequency events.

(d) Justification / outside-inside adjustment  
Outside view base rate: In 85 Russian regions ~10–12 governors change per year → 0.13–0.14 per governor-year. Applied to 20 days ≈ 0.7% baseline.  
Adjustments:  
+5 pp for elevated medical risk (well-documented pancreatic necrosis, kidney failure, coma episode) — roughly 7× normal mortality.  
+3 pp for explicit resignation request (rare, makes formal removal thinkable in next few weeks).  
+2 pp for visible succession preparations (Alaudinov elevation, Adam Kadyrov promotions).  
–2 pp for very strong historical pattern of walk-backs and Putin dependence.  
–1 pp for short administrative window (public holidays around 9 May just passed, limited federal bandwidth).  

Inside view probability ≈ 0.7 + 5 + 3 + 2 − 2 − 1 ≈ 8.7 % → round to 9 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 9 out of 100 times in comparable situations Kadyrov would cease to be head in the next 20 days. Uncertainty band ±4 pp; a 10 pp swing would require credible news of a hospitalisation (up) or explicit Kremlin denial of resignation rumours (down).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Kadyrov stop being Chechen head before 1 Jun 2025 (20 days left)?  
2. Base rate ≈ 0.7 % for any governor in 20 days.  
3. “9 out of 100 times, he leaves office.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Formal request to step down. b) No Kremlin decree yet. c) Long record of similar bluffing. d) Serious, well-sourced health issues. e) Kremlin succession grooming signals.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden fatal medical event or silent Kremlin swap during holiday weekend could spike probability.  
6. Status-quo bias checked; inertia remains dominant hence probability kept below 10 %.

Probability: 9%
Predicted Probability: 9.0%

- Putin's constitutional authority over Kadyrov's appointment/removal

**Weak evidence:**
- Speculation about Kadyrov-Putin tensions
- Unconfirmed severity of current health condition
- Various theories about resignation motives

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is very short: May 12 to June 1, 2025 (20 days).

This timeframe significantly impacts the forecast:
- Russian leadership transitions, especially in strategically important regions, typically take months
- The very recent Putin meeting (May 7) and subsequent statements strongly suggest no immediate change
- Even with deteriorating health, the formal replacement process would likely extend beyond June 1
- If the timeframe doubled to 40 days, probability would increase modestly
- If halved to 10 days, probability would decrease significantly

## (d) Justification

Integrating the evidence:

1. **Pattern of unfulfilled resignation requests**: This is at least Kadyrov's third or fourth public resignation overture (2016, 2022, possibly others). None resulted in his departure, establishing a strong pattern that suggests the current instance will follow suit.

2. **Very recent Putin meeting**: Just five days ago, Kadyrov met Putin and subsequently reversed course, indicating he received "full understanding and support" and would continue serving. This dramatically reduces the likelihood of departure within the next 20 days.

3. **Health considerations**: Multiple sources consistently mention pancreatic necrosis and other serious conditions. This represents the main risk factor that could lead to sudden departure through death or incapacitation.

4. **Kremlin authority**: Putin appointed Kadyrov in 2007 and would need to approve any resignation. The May 7 meeting and subsequent statements strongly suggest Putin does not currently support his departure.

5. **Succession planning**: While there are signs of preparation (promoting son Adam, possible Kremlin backing for Alaudinov), these suggest a longer-term transition rather than an imminent one.

The evidence overwhelmingly indicates Kadyrov will remain in power through June 1. His pattern of unfulfilled resignation requests, the very recent Putin meeting, and the short timeframe all point to continuity. The only significant risk factor is his health condition, which could lead to sudden incapacitation or death.

# Probability calibration

To calibrate my prediction, I'll start with the reference class of Kadyrov's previous resignation requests, which have a 0% rate of leading to actual resignation (0 out of 3+ previous instances). This suggests a very low probability.

However, I must account for his reported serious health condition. Multiple sources consistently mention pancreatic necrosis, which can be life-threatening. That said, given he's been managing this condition since at least 2019 and was able to meet with Putin on May 7, the probability of death or complete incapacitation within this specific 20-day window remains low.

The most compelling evidence is the May 7 meeting with Putin, after which Kadyrov explicitly indicated he would continue in his role. This very recent development strongly suggests the status quo will continue through the short forecast period.

Given these factors, I assess:
- Base rate from previous resignation requests: ~0-1% probability of departure
- Adjustment for health concerns: Small increase (+2-4%)
- Adjustment for very recent Putin meeting: Strong decrease (-1-2%)
- Consideration of 20-day timeframe: Further decrease (insufficient time for transition)

Weighing these factors, I estimate approximately a 3% chance that Kadyrov will cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025.

# Checklist:
1. Will Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be Head of Chechen Republic by any means before June 1, 2025?
2. Base rate: Previous Kadyrov resignation requests have 0% success rate
3. 3 out of 100 times, Kadyrov ceases to be head of Chechnya before June 1, primarily through sudden health crisis
4. Key evidence: May 7 Putin meeting with backtracking; pattern of unfulfilled resignation requests; serious but managed health issues since 2019; 20-day window insufficient for transition
5. Blind spot: Kadyrov's health could be significantly worse than publicly known
6. Status quo is Kadyrov remaining in power; short timeframe and recent developments warrant nudge toward this outcome

Probability: 3%
Predicted Probability: 3.0%

5. **Newsweek (May 6, 2025)**
   - Type: Major US-based international news magazine
   - Quality: Reliable mainstream reporting
   - Key facts: Kadyrov (48) asked to be relieved; appointed by Putin in 2007; led Chechnya for 18 years

6. **Baku.ws (date unclear, May 2025)**
   - Type: Regional news aggregator from Azerbaijan
   - Quality: Variable reliability; requires cross-checking
   - Key facts: Kadyrov told "Chechnya Today" he asked to be relieved; denied health rumors
   - Expert opinions: None from identifiable experts

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
1. Kadyrov's public statement seeking relief from his post (confirmed by multiple independent sources)
2. Putin-Kadyrov meeting on May 7, followed by Kadyrov's claim of receiving "full understanding and support" (Moscow Times)
3. Kadyrov's historical pattern of making similar resignation requests without stepping down (2016, 2022, 2023)
4. Putin's established system of appointing and removing regional leaders, which gives him near-absolute control over Kadyrov's position

**Moderate evidence:**
1. Kadyrov's documented health problems (Novaya Gazeta Europe's investigation from 2024)
2. Preparations for succession, including promotion of Adam Kadyrov and/or grooming of Apti Alaudinov
3. Kadyrov's withdrawal from day-to-day governance since February 2025 (per Novaya Gazeta sources)

**Weak evidence:**
1. Speculation about Kadyrov's motives (tactical vs. genuine)
2. Reports of a Kadyrov-Putin rift over unsanctioned Gulf state talks
3. Unverified rumors about Kadyrov's current health status

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction timeframe is short - from today (May 12, 2025) to June 1, 2025 (approximately 20 days).

If the timeframe were halved (10 days):
- Probability would decrease significantly, as even if a decision to remove Kadyrov had been made, administrative processes and political maneuvering would be difficult to complete so quickly.

If the timeframe were doubled (40 days):
- Probability would increase moderately, allowing more time for health deterioration or political arrangements to be finalized.
- Would also increase chances of unforeseen events precipitating change.

## (d) Justification

The most compelling factors affecting the prediction:

1. **Putin's apparent recent endorsement (May 7)**: The meeting and Kadyrov's claim of receiving "full understanding and support" strongly suggests no imminent removal is planned.

2. **Historical pattern of similar requests**: Kadyrov has made similar resignation requests in the past without stepping down, establishing a pattern where such requests are likely performative rather than genuine.

3. **Short timeframe**: With only 20 days until resolution, there is limited time for a carefully managed transition in this sensitive region. Given security implications, leadership changes in Chechnya would likely be planned well in advance.

4. **Health concerns**: Documented health problems could potentially force a sudden change if Kadyrov's condition deteriorates dramatically, representing the main factor that could lead to an unexpected change.

5. **Succession preparations**: The grooming of potential successors suggests preparation for eventual transition, but on a longer-term timeline rather than imminent change.

These factors suggest a low probability of Kadyrov ceasing to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025. The outside view base rate of 5% is reasonable given Kadyrov's history of making resignation requests without stepping down, combined with Putin's apparent recent endorsement.

# Probability calibration

Given the strong evidence of Putin's very recent meeting with Kadyrov (May 7) and subsequent claims of support, I would adjust the outside view probability slightly downward. The extremely short timeframe (20 days) makes a planned transition highly unlikely given the complexity of Chechen politics and security arrangements.

Kadyrov's documented health issues create a small but real possibility of sudden incapacitation that could force a change, but there's no evidence of immediate deterioration that would necessitate this within the 20-day window.

The consistent pattern of previous resignation requests without actual departures strongly suggests this is another case of political maneuvering rather than genuine intent to leave office.

I assess there is a 4% probability that Kadyrov will cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025.

# Checklist:
1. Will Ramzan Kadyrov stop being Head of Chechnya for any reason before June 1, 2025 (~20 days from now)?
2. Outside view: 5% chance based on historical resignation requests and regional leadership patterns
3. 4 out of 100 times, Kadyrov would cease being Chechen head within ~20 days of a situation like current one
4. Key evidence: May 7 Putin meeting with "full support"; pattern of unfulfilled resignation requests; short 20-day timeframe; documented health issues
5. Blind spot: Undetected serious health deterioration requiring immediate step-down
6. Status quo strongly favors Kadyrov remaining in power through June 1

Probability: 4%
Predicted Probability: 4.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Jamestown Foundation (May 5, 2025)  
   – Facts: Kadyrov formally asked Putin to relieve him of his post; Putin declined on May 7; notes severe pancreatic necrosis with ~79% one‐year mortality in Russia.  
   – Quality: Reputable Eurasia-focused think tank, well‐sourced though mortality statistic is broad.  
   – Opinions: Analysts speculate on succession (Apti Alaudinov, Kadyrov’s children). Credible but not definitive.  

2. RFE/RL (June 25, 2021)  
   – Facts: In 2016 Kadyrov feigned retirement before re-election; won with 98% of vote.  
   – Quality: Reliable US-funded broadcaster with strong track record on Russian affairs; labeled “undesirable” by Russia but factual reporting.  
   – Opinions: Chechen diaspora leaders on legitimacy of Kadyrov’s support. Useful context but dated.  

3. The Moscow Times (May 6 & 8, 2025)  
   – Facts: On May 5 Kadyrov asked to step down, then on May 7 met Putin who “gave full support.” Kadyrov publicly backed away from resignation talk.  
   – Quality: Independent but “undesirable” in Russia; consistently reliable on Kremlin dynamics.  
   – Opinions: Unnamed analysts view resignation threats as tactical leverage. Plausible.  

4. Newshub.ge (May 6, 2025)  
   – Facts: Confirms Kadyrov’s resignation request.  
   – Quality: Secondary aggregator relying on Nexta Live; no expert commentary. Low to moderate reliability on facts.  

5. AOL/NBC (May 5, 2025)  
   – Facts: Kadyrov asked Putin to relieve him; notes 99.73% vote in 2021; son Adam’s security appointment.  
   – Quality: Aggregator but cross-checks well with other outlets. Factual.  
   – Opinions: Cites Human Rights Watch on election quality.  

6. Perplexity report (various dates)  
   – Facts: Compiles Kadyrov’s retirement bids (2022, 2023, May 2025), explains Chechen institutional structure.  
   – Quality: Secondary compilation; generally reliable but should be confirmed.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
1. Putin’s public support (Moscow Times, Jamestown) – Strong evidence for continuity; multiple independent, reliable sources.  
2. Historical pattern of feigned retirements (RFE/RL; multiple dates) – Strong: Kadyrov has twice before threatened to resign and stayed.  
3. Serious chronic health issues (Jamestown; Novaya Gazeta Europe background) – Moderate: health is dire but long-standing, survival beyond initial diagnosis.  
4. Grooming of successors (OC Media, Novaya Gazeta Europe) – Moderate: signals transition plan but no immediate power handover.  
5. Time window is extremely short (20 days) – Strong: abrupt removal requires exceptional event.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
– Today is May 12, 2025; resolution date June 1, 2025 → 20 days.  
– If window were half (~10 days), probability would shrink further (~2–3%) because even health crises can take weeks.  
– If window doubled (~40 days), modest increase (~6–8%), largely reflecting health risk.  

(d) Justification  
Outside view base rate: Kadyrov has threatened resignation 3 times (2016, 2022, 2025) with no departure → implied 0% success historically.  
Adjustments:  
– Health: Annual mortality ~79% → ~7.8% risk over 3 weeks. But he’s lived with this for years and enjoys top-tier medical care → discount to ~4%.  
– Political: Putin’s reaffirmed support on May 8 makes forced removal or allowed departure extremely unlikely → <1%.  
– Voluntary: Past threats as bargaining tactics → negligible (<1%).  

Combine health (~4%) + other pathways (~1%) → ~5% total. Given uncertainties and possible overestimation of mortality, I lean toward the lower end of that range.

Probability calibration  
I adjust my prior (4%) slightly upward to account for the credible, high mortality estimate, then discount for his survival thus far. Final inside‐view probability: 5%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be Head of Chechnya by June 1, 2025?  
2. Base rate: 0% past resignations succeeded; typical authoritarian leaders don’t depart abruptly.  
3. Consistency: “5 out of 100 times, Kadyrov leaves by June 1.” Reflects small health‐driven risk plus negligible political risk.  
4. Top evidence:  
   a. Putin’s public support (strong)  
   b. Chronic health with high mortality rate (moderate)  
   c. Historical resignation feints (strong)  
5. Blind spot: Sudden violent event (assassination, coup) could spike probability unexpectedly.  
6. Status quo: Likely remains in power; situation stable absent crisis.

Probability: 5%
Predicted Probability: 5.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Jamestown Foundation (May 5, 2025) – Reliable policy think-tank. Reports Kadyrov’s formal resignation request and Putin’s refusal. Factuals from Chechnya Today; experts speculate tactical motives.  
2. The Moscow Times (May 8, 2025) – Independent, albeit “undesirable” in Russia. Confirms Kadyrov–Putin meeting and Kremlin backing. Quotes from Kadyrov’s Telegram.  
3. OC Media (May 6, 2025) – Regional outlet of moderate reliability. Documents Kadyrov’s withdrawal from duties, health treatments, and son-succession campaign. Cites Novaya Gazeta, iStories.  
4. Novaya Gazeta Europe (April 23, 2024) – Investigative outlet. Details Kadyrov’s chronic health issues and grooming of Apti Alaudinov. Historical with strong sourcing.  
5. Newsweek (May 6, 2025) – Mainstream. Repeats Kadyrov’s request and walk-back. No new forecasting cues.  
6. Baku.ws (undated) – Low reliability. Confirms Kadyrov’s request only. No unique insights.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Kremlin support (Moscow Times): Putin met Kadyrov May 7 and publicly “understands and supports” him, undercutting a removal.  
• Historical tenure stability (Novaya Europe; reference class): No previous short-term removal; Chechnya an extreme outlier of stability since 2007.  
Moderate evidence  
• Repeated resignation requests (Jamestown, OC Media): Four prior requests with no effect—shows pattern but signals possible long-term shift.  
• Succession grooming (OC Media, Novaya Europe): Adam Kadyrov and Alaudinov elevated—indicates contingency planning but not immediate handover.  
Weak evidence  
• Health rumors (Novaya Europe, OC Media): Chronic issues and hospital stays raise long-term uncertainty but no sign of imminent incapacity.  
• Unverified tensions with Putin (The Moscow Times, OC Media): Reports of unsanctioned Gulf talks—could erode trust but no concrete Kremlin action yet.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 20 days (May 12–June 1, 2025).  
– Halved (10 days): Even lower odds (<1%)—too little time for Kremlin to finalize removal.  
– Doubled (40 days): Slightly higher odds (~2%) but still constrained by Putin’s reaffirmed support and procedural inertia.

(d) Justification & inside‐view adjustment  
Base‐rate (outside view): ~0.14% chance of any regional‐head turnover in a 20-day window (2.5% annual rate).  
Inside cues: Kadyrov’s public resignation request would boost odds, but Putin’s May 7 endorsement and Chechnya’s stability strongly counteract this. No firm evidence of an imminent health collapse or Kremlin directive to replace him.  
Calibration: Uplift base‐rate by ~7× for the unusual request, but offset by Putin’s support → ~1%.

Probability calibration  
Given the extremely low reference‐class turnover, Kadyrov’s entrenched position, and recent Putin backing, a ~1% probability best reflects the true odds. A ±1% shift would significantly change implied odds (e.g., 2% is 50:1 against), so we keep probability low.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Kadyrov cease as Chechen head before June 1, 2025? Yes/no by credible reports, within 20 days.  
2. Outside view base rate: ~0.14% for any regional head turnover in 20 days.  
3. Consistency: “1 out of 100 times, Kadyrov steps down before June 1, 2025.” Aligns with his Kremlin protection and tenure.  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Putin’s public support (strong).  
   • Historical stability of Chechen leadership (strong).  
   • Multiple failed prior resignation bids (moderate).  
   • Succession grooming but no formal handover (moderate).  
   • Chronic health but no collapse (weak).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden health crisis or Kremlin purge (e.g., secret indictment) could force immediate removal—unlikely but would upset the forecast.  
6. Status quo: The status quo is extremely stable; absent a major shock, Kadyrov stays.

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Moscow Times (8 May 2025). Independent, Western-based Russian outlet; usually reliable on factual Kremlin personnel news. Mostly quotes Kadyrov’s own Telegram posts and Kremlin footage (facts) + unnamed analysts’ interpretation (opinions).  
2. Yahoo News / Business Insider (7 May 2025). Relays Kyiv Independent translation of state agency “Chechnya Today”; factual quotes reliable; additional colour is journalistic opinion.  
3. OC-Media (6 May 2025). Caucasus-focused, generally credible; uses multiple primary sources (Chechnya Today, Novaya Gazeta, internal leaks). Distinguishes facts from speculation.  
4. Novaya Gazeta Europe (23 Apr 2024). Investigative reputation, anti-Kremlin; long lead time but deep sourcing on health. Good for background, less for current situational changes.  
5. Newsweek (6 May 2025). Western mainstream; re-reports the resignation request; no new primary evidence.  
6. Baku.ws (undated 2025). Regional aggregator; weakest reliability; offers no new facts beyond restating Chechnya Today quotes.

(b) Evidence analysis (re resolution: Kadyrov no longer Head before 1 Jun 2025)

Strong evidence  
• Only Putin can dismiss/accept resignation; no Kremlin decree issued (structural, high-credibility, status-quo-maintaining).  
• 18-year record of repeated “I’ll step down” statements with zero follow-through (historical pattern, high predictive power).  

Moderate evidence  
• Kadyrov’s public request to be relieved (single direct source, 6 May 2025) shows non-zero intention.  
• Persistent, multi-source reports of serious chronic illness raise non-trivial death/incapacity risk.  
• Kremlin’s visible grooming of alternatives (Alaudinov, Adam) suggests contingency planning.  

Weak evidence  
• Rumoured Putin–Kadyrov rift (anonymous Telegram, unverified).  
• Speculation that request is a bargaining tactic (analyst opinion, plausible but conjectural).

Net evidence direction: small upward pressure on the chance of a change, but strong inertia factors dominate.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining: 20 days. If horizon were doubled (40 days) I would raise odds ~1.3× (to ~15%). If halved (10 days) I’d cut odds ~0.7× (to ~8%). Short window sharply limits probability because both formal dismissal and death are low-frequency events.

(d) Justification / outside-inside adjustment  
Outside view base rate: In 85 Russian regions ~10–12 governors change per year → 0.13–0.14 per governor-year. Applied to 20 days ≈ 0.7% baseline.  
Adjustments:  
+5 pp for elevated medical risk (well-documented pancreatic necrosis, kidney failure, coma episode) — roughly 7× normal mortality.  
+3 pp for explicit resignation request (rare, makes formal removal thinkable in next few weeks).  
+2 pp for visible succession preparations (Alaudinov elevation, Adam Kadyrov promotions).  
–2 pp for very strong historical pattern of walk-backs and Putin dependence.  
–1 pp for short administrative window (public holidays around 9 May just passed, limited federal bandwidth).  

Inside view probability ≈ 0.7 + 5 + 3 + 2 − 2 − 1 ≈ 8.7 % → round to 9 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 9 out of 100 times in comparable situations Kadyrov would cease to be head in the next 20 days. Uncertainty band ±4 pp; a 10 pp swing would require credible news of a hospitalisation (up) or explicit Kremlin denial of resignation rumours (down).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Kadyrov stop being Chechen head before 1 Jun 2025 (20 days left)?  
2. Base rate ≈ 0.7 % for any governor in 20 days.  
3. “9 out of 100 times, he leaves office.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Formal request to step down. b) No Kremlin decree yet. c) Long record of similar bluffing. d) Serious, well-sourced health issues. e) Kremlin succession grooming signals.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden fatal medical event or silent Kremlin swap during holiday weekend could spike probability.  
6. Status-quo bias checked; inertia remains dominant hence probability kept below 10 %.

Probability: 9%
Predicted Probability: 9.0%...
