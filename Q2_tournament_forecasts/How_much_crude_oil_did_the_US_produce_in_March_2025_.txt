Historical output: Analysis:
The key to forecasting March 2025 US crude oil production is anchoring on historic monthly EIA field‐production data (the “out-view”) and then adjusting for recent policy moves (the “in-view”). Historically, US monthly crude production rose from ~11 million barrels/day in early 2020 to ~13.2 million b/d by late 2024 (equating to roughly 360–410 million barrels/month, or 360,000–410,000 thousand barrels). Seasonal factors (spring maintenance, winter storms) introduce modest down-months in February/March, but the Trump emergency declaration in January 2025 and pledge of aggressive lease approvals point to modest upside—potentially adding 0.1–0.3 million b/d by Q2 2025. 

To ground the forecast, we need:
• A baseline from EIA’s historical monthly series through March 2025.  
• Year-over-year comparisons (e.g., March 2024 vs. March 2025).  
• Any immediate post-January 2025 upticks.

Article: “Trump has declared a ‘national energy emergency.’ What does that mean?”  
Source: NPR, Jan. 22, 2025, Camila Domonoske  

Summary:  
• On Jan. 20, 2025, President Trump invoked the National Emergencies Act to declare the first-ever “national energy emergency,” framing it as a tool to “do whatever you have to do” to boost domestic fossil-fuel production.  

• Key directives in the emergency order include:  
  – Agencies to explore use of federal eminent domain and the Defense Production Act to speed energy projects.  
  – Consideration of emergency waivers under the Clean Water Act or Endangered Species Act to facilitate drilling and infrastructure.  
  – Potential year-round sale of higher-ethanol fuels via emergency waivers.  

• Emergency powers potentially allow the president to suspend environmental regulations or restrict crude-oil exports, though this order does not explicitly invoke those authorities.  

• Historical context:  
  – No prior “national energy emergency” has been declared, though regional energy emergencies occurred in the 1970s under President Carter in response to fuel shortages.  
  – Energy historian Daniel Yergin notes those 1970s actions included limited regulatory suspensions, but always with public-health caveats.  

• Trump’s broader energy agenda:  
  – Emphasis solely on fossil fuels and critical minerals; solar and wind are excluded by the order’s definition.  
  – Plans to roll back regulations, expand leasing on federal lands, and encourage more drilling, building pipelines, transmission lines and power plants (including coal).  
  – A separate “Unleashing American Energy” order seeks to block new appliance-efficiency mandates and dismantle what Trump calls the “electric vehicle mandate.”  

• Context and expert views:  
  – The U.S. is currently the world’s largest oil producer and a net exporter; analysts cited by NPR project a near-term global oversupply of oil and gas.  
  – A Trump administration official (anonymous) told reporters the emergency “will unlock…authorities” to produce more coal and other resources, create jobs and bolster security.  
  – The Brennan Center observes that while statutes allow broad emergency powers over environmental rules and exports, this specific order stops short of invoking them.  
  – The auto industry favors regulatory stability and warns against abrupt rollbacks of EV incentives; the oil industry strongly supports Trump’s deregulatory approach.  
  – Trump has vowed to cut energy prices by 50%, a target analysts deem highly unlikely; by contrast, the 2020 pandemic led to only a 19% drop in U.S. energy costs.

Below is a summary of the Center for American Progress article “Opening More Lands and Waters for Oil Drilling Won’t Lower Energy Prices” (Feb. 10, 2025).  

Disclaimer: The extraction appears complete to the best of my assessment.  

1. Facts & Statistics  
• The United States is producing more crude oil than at any point in history.  
• The oil industry holds more than 35 million acres of federal oil & gas leases—an area roughly the size of Florida—but produces on less than half of those acres.  
  – Onshore: ~10 million acres (46%) are leased but not producing.  
  – Offshore: ~9 million acres (79%) are leased but not producing.  
• Only about 25% of U.S. oil and gas production occurs on federal lands and waters; the other 75% is on state and private lands.  
• Domestic natural-gas prices could rise by more than 30% if the U.S. exports more LNG, tying U.S. prices to global markets.  
• From 2021–2023, U.S. retail gasoline reached a peak near $5 per gallon.  
• The last congressionally-mandated Arctic National Wildlife Refuge lease sale received zero bids.  
• Companies at a 2024 Trump fundraising dinner (to whom he promised regulatory rollbacks) made over $75 billion in 2023.  

2. Opinions from Reliable, Named Sources  
• New York Times (week into Trump’s term): “For drilling and fracking to pick up substantially, oil and natural gas prices would have to rise, [industry] executives say.”  
• Reuters: Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” mantra overestimates “the industry’s willingness to prioritize growth over generating shareholder returns.”  
• Federal Trade Commission (2024 allegation): Hess and Pioneer allegedly attempted to collude with OPEC, costing U.S. consumers an estimated $500–$1,000 per household per year.  

3. Key Arguments & Assertions  
• Mandating new federal lease sales will not lower gasoline or energy prices; it merely shifts public lands toward oil & gas at the expense of recreation, conservation, and renewables.  
• Oil companies won’t produce more unless it improves their bottom line; additional leases are valuable mainly as balance-sheet assets.  
• Expediting export infrastructure (e.g., LNG terminals) can raise domestic fuel costs and hurt U.S. consumers.  
• Many newly opened areas (e.g., Arctic, East Coast, Florida waters) lack industry interest or face local/governmental opposition.  
• Loosening environmental safeguards and review processes benefits corporate polluters financially without guaranteeing increased domestic supply or lower consumer prices.  

4. Potentially Useful Opinions from Less-Clearly-Identified Sources  
• The article quotes “industry insiders” broadly to support the view that oil majors won’t boost output absent higher prices; these sources are not individually named.

<Summary source="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/seven-questions-and-expert-answers-about-trumps-first-actions-to-transform-us-energy/">
Article: “Seven questions (and expert answers) about Trump’s first actions to transform US energy”  
Source: Atlantic Council, Jan. 22, 2025  

Context  
• On day one of his second term, President Trump issued an executive order declaring a “national energy emergency,” aiming to fast-track fossil energy permitting, boost production, fill strategic reserves, and expand exports.  
• He lifted the Department of Energy’s pause on LNG export license approvals.  
• These moves reverse many clean-energy and climate policies of the previous administration.  

Key points and expert perspectives  

1. Implementation and timing (Reed Blakemore, Atlantic Council)  
  – The emergency declaration sets a broad policy direction but requires agency studies and scoping before action.  
  – Immediate effects likely to be expanded exploration activity; a production boom will depend on capital-return priorities in the shale patch.  
  – Interaction with forthcoming tariffs (on Canada, Mexico, China, EU) and sanctions (Iran, Russia, Venezuela) will shape actual outcomes.  

2. Intention vs. action (David Goldwyn, Goldwyn Global Strategies)  
  – The order signals intent to promote oil and gas and to roll back renewables/climate rules, but regulatory changes take time and face legal challenges.  
  – Investment decisions will hinge on market demand, returns on new wells, state-level policies, and the impact of foreign sanctions on supply chains and prices.  

3. Limits of federal authority (Andrea Clabough, Goldwyn Global Strategies)  
  – Without new legislation, the federal government’s power to expedite permitting is constrained.  
  – State and local governments retain significant control over energy siting and environmental rules.  
  – Change is gradual as key agency posts are filled and lawsuits proceed.  

4. Geopolitical dimensions  
  – Energy dominance is a tool in U.S.–China competition.  
  – Three strategic levers:  
    • Oil and gas exports (including nearly doubling LNG capacity by 2028) to strengthen allies and U.S. leverage.  
    • Electricity supply for AI data centers (grid reform and transmission policy may be needed).  
    • Advanced battery technologies with both commercial and military applications.  

Overall takeaway  
Trump’s early actions underscore a pivot to maximizing fossil-fuel development and exports as cornerstones of economic growth and geopolitical strategy. However, the path from executive intent to material increases in production and exports depends on lengthy rule-making processes, legal challenges, private-sector investment decisions, and the interplay of domestic and foreign policy factors.

# Monthly U.S. Field Crude Oil Production Through March 2025: Trends and Seasonality Analysis

## Recent Production Trends  
U.S. crude oil field production reached unprecedented levels in 2024 and early 2025, driven by technological advancements and strategic investments in key basins. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), **monthly production exceeded 13 million barrels per day (mb/d) 17 times between 2023 and January 2025**, with a record-high monthly average of **13.451 mb/d in December 2024**[42]. This growth reflects the continued dominance of the Permian Basin, which accounted for nearly half of national output, averaging **6.3 mb/d in 2024**[33].  

The EIA's March 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) revised its 2025 annual production forecast upward to **13.61 mb/d**, citing improved efficiency in Lower 48 states[2]. However, weekly data revealed a short-term dip to **13.37 mb/d in early May 2025**, a **-0.73% decline from April 2025**[5]. This fluctuation underscores the volatility inherent in real-time production reporting.  

---

## Monthly Production Data Through March 2025  
| Month     | Production (mb/d) | Key Observations |  
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|  
| Oct 2024  | 13.436            | **Peak monthly production** in 2024[1] |  
| Nov 2024  | 13.352            | Slight decline due to seasonal maintenance[42] |  
| Dec 2024  | 13.451            | Year-end surge in Permian output[42] |  
| Jan 2025  | 13.15             | **13.7% decline from December 2024** due to winter storms[27] |  
| Feb 2025  | 13.16             | Slow recovery post-weather disruptions[27] |  
| Mar 2025  | 13.50             | Q1 2025 average of 13.40 mb/d[1][10] |  

*Data Sources: EIA STEO reports [1][2][10], Weekly Petroleum Status [5][24], and production surveys [27][42].*  

---

## Seasonal Patterns  
The EIA's historical data reveals consistent **winter production declines** attributed to:  
1. **Weather disruptions**: Subfreezing temperatures in major producing states (e.g., Texas production fell by **105,000 b/d in January 2025**[27]).  
2. **Operational adjustments**: Year-end inventory drawdowns and tax considerations[36].  

This seasonality is evident in the **10.6% month-over-month drop from December 2024 to January 2025**, aligning with patterns observed since 2020[27]. Spring typically brings recovery, as seen in the March 2025 rebound to **13.50 mb/d**[10].  

---

## Regional Contributions (2025 Forecasts)  
- **Permian Basin**: Projected to produce **48% of U.S. output** (6.5 mb/d)[33].  
- **Federal Gulf of America**: Steady at **1.80 mb/d**, despite rebranding from Gulf of Mexico[10].  
- **Alaska**: Marginal growth to **0.44 mb/d**, constrained by infrastructure[2].  

---

## Market Context  
- **Price Sensitivity**: The EIA ties production forecasts to West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices, revising its 2025 outlook downward by **$6/barrel in Q4 2024**[26].  
- **Global Impacts**: U.S. growth offsets OPEC+ cuts, with 2025 global production forecast at **78.39 mb/d**[1].  

---

## Data Limitations  
The EIA's monthly figures combine:  
1. **Survey-based reports** from major states[11].  
2. **Modeled estimates** for smaller producers[9].  
3. **Adjustments** for pipeline logistics and storage[15].  

Discrepancies between weekly and monthly data (e.g., May 2025's **13.37 mb/d weekly vs. 13.46 mb/d monthly**[5][24]) highlight the challenges of real-time tracking.  

---

## Conclusion  
U.S. crude oil production remains on an upward trajectory, with the EIA anticipating **13.76 mb/d annual average by 2026**[2]. However, winter seasonality and geopolitical factors introduce short-term volatility. The Permian Basin's outperformance and technological innovations in hydraulic fracturing continue to underpin long-term growth, solidifying the United States' position as the global production leader.

Current output: Analysis:
We need recent data and reporting that reflect how fast US producers can increase output under Trump’s national energy emergency and “drill baby drill” push, especially in key basins (Permian, DJ, Bakken). Key indicators and sources include:
- EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook and monthly production updates through February 2025 to establish the recent baseline.
- Baker Hughes rig count and drilling permit approvals on federal lands to gauge activity ramp‐up.
- Operator investor presentations or earnings calls discussing well completions, productivity gains, midstream constraints (e.g., pipeline capacity).
- News on new pipeline projects, export capacity (Gulf Coast infrastructure), and OPEC+ price environment influencing US shale.
- Federal leasing and permitting changes following the national energy emergency directive.

Summary of “U.S. drillers set to switch focus from oil to gas in 2025” (John Kemp, JKempEnergy.com, March 12, 2025)

Facts & statistics  
• U.S. gas futures (inflation-adjusted front-month) have more than doubled over the past 12 months, rising from a record low to the 38th percentile of monthly readings since 2000; oil futures have fallen 17%, to the 33rd percentile (from the 51st a year ago).  
• Hedge funds’ net long position in U.S. gas futures and options stands at 3,472 bcf (96th percentile since 2010); their net long in U.S. crude futures and options is just 75 million barrels (4th percentile since 2011).  
• U.S. gas inventories are below the ten-year seasonal average (slowed production, record power-gen demand, rising exports, coldest winter in six years); oil stocks are also below average but face price pressure from weak global demand growth and planned OPEC⁺ output increases.  
• On an energy-equivalent basis, gas prices in March 2025 are about 37% of oil prices (88th percentile since 2000), up from 12% in March 2024.  
• In 2023, “oil wells” supplied 10% of U.S. gas production as associated/dissolved gas; “gas wells” yielded nearly 6.5 million b/d of natural gas liquids and natural gasoline, of which up to 0.7 million b/d are blended into crude.  

Named opinions  
• U.S. Energy Secretary (television interview): “Gas output is going to grow dramatically while oil is not going to grow meaningfully in the short run.”  
• Most hedge fund managers (inferred from positioning): expect further shifts of drilling toward gas-rich formations and away from oil through 2025–26.  

Analysis highlights  
• The futures market is signaling a pivot from oil toward gas drilling for the remainder of 2025 into early 2026.  
• Co-production of oil, gas and NGL means drilling shifts are not perfectly separable, but the dominant effect is expected in stronger gas prices and weaker oil prices.

Summary of IEA Oil Market Report – March 2025 (IEA, 13 March 2025)

• Crude prices  
  – ICE Brent futures fell by $11/barrel over the past eight weeks, trading near three-year lows (~$70/bbl) amid economic growth concerns and OPEC+’s planned April rollback of voluntary cuts.

• Macroeconomic backdrop  
  – Escalating US trade tensions and retaliatory measures have tilted macro risks to the downside, weakening the outlook for oil demand growth.

• Oil demand  
  – 4Q 2024 and 1Q 2025 growth projections were marginally downgraded to ~1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d); both advanced and developing markets have reported demand below earlier estimates.  
  – Full-year 2025 global oil-demand growth is still forecast to average just over 1 mb/d (vs. 830 kb/d in 2024), helped by lower prices.  
  – Asia will account for almost 60% of demand gains, led by China, where petrochemical feedstocks alone are expected to drive all growth as refined-fuel demand plateaus.

• Oil supply  
  – February production jumped by 240 kb/d, driven by Tengizchevroil’s ramp-up of the long-delayed Tengiz expansion, pushing Kazakh output to all-time highs.  
  – Iran and Venezuela also boosted flows ahead of tighter sanctions; Venezuelan supply is expected to fall from April when Chevron’s licence expires.  
  – OPEC+’s nominal +138 kb/d increase in April may be less than half that, since only Saudi Arabia (and to a much lesser extent Algeria) has room to raise output; other voluntary-cut members collectively overproduced by 1.2 mb/d in February (IEA estimate).  
  – The United States is at record production levels and is forecast to be the largest source of supply growth in 2025, followed by Canada, Brazil and Guyana.  
  – Proposed US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican oil, effective 1 April, could disrupt flows and pricing; those two countries accounted for ~70% of US crude imports in 2024.  
  – Recent sanctions on Russia and Iran have not yet materially disrupted their loadings, though some buyers have begun to scale back.

• Market balance and risks  
  – IEA’s current supply-demand balance suggests a surplus of ~600 kb/d in 2025.  
  – If OPEC+ continues unwinding cuts beyond April without reining in members that are over-producing, the surplus could increase by another ~400 kb/d.  
  – The ultimate impact of tariffs and ongoing trade negotiations on oil flows and prices remains highly uncertain.

<Summary source="https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/economics-markets/article/55274110/eia-forecasts-tight-global-oil-markets-until-mid-2025">
Here are the key points from the March 12, 2025 O&G Journal write‐up of the EIA’s March Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO):

1. Global oil market balance  
   • Inventories are expected to tighten in Q2 2025, driven by lower output from Iran and Venezuela.  
   • As a result, the Brent spot price is forecast to rise from roughly $70/barrel now to about $75/barrel by Q3 2025.  

2. Longer-term supply and price outlook  
   • After mid-2025, global stocks should rebuild as OPEC+ unwinds cuts and non-OPEC output (notably in the Americas) grows.  
   • That rebound is projected to put downward pressure on prices, with average Brent at $68/barrel in 2026.  

3. Recent price and policy developments  
   • February’s average Brent price was $75/barrel – $4 below January and $8 below February 2024 – weighed down by trade-tariff concerns (U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China were announced Feb. 1, though most Canada/Mexico tariffs are now delayed until April).  
   • New U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude (announced Feb. 24) and revoked Venezuelan export licenses are expected to curb supplies further beginning in March.  

4. OPEC+ production adjustment  
   • On March 3, OPEC+ confirmed it will “gradually and flexibly” phase in the full 2.2 million b/d of previously agreed voluntary cuts starting April 1, 2025, but may pause or reverse increases if market conditions require.  

5. Natural gas and power sector impacts

<Summary source="https://energyandcleanair.org/march-2025-monthly-analysis-of-russian-fossil-fuel-exports-and-sanctions/">
Article: “March 2025 — Monthly analysis of Russian fossil fuel exports and sanctions,” Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Petras Katinas & Vaibhav Raghunandan), April 15 2025.

Key findings  
• Russia’s total fossil-fuel export revenues in March rose 1% month-on-month to €637 million per day; volumes were up 6%.  
• Seaborne crude oil revenues jumped 14% to €212 million/day (volumes +24%); pipeline crude revenues fell 2% to €81 million/day.  
• LNG revenues dropped 23% to €40 million/day (volumes −22%); pipeline gas revenues fell 19% to €64 million/day (volumes −11%).  
• Seaborne oil-product revenues rose 6% to €178 million/day; coal revenues rose 10% to €60 million/day.  

Sanctions and price-cap impact  
• G7-owned or -insured vessels carried 20% more Russian crude month-on-month; shipments on these vessels were 36% higher and double January’s volumes.  
• Full enforcement of a $60-per-barrel cap would have cut Russia’s revenues by 8% in March (~€0.94 billion); since December 2022 it would have cut revenues by 11% (≈€38.1 billion).  
• A $30-per-barrel cap would have reduced March revenues by 39% (~€4.74 billion) and, over the sanctions period, by 40% (≈€134 billion).  

Top buyers (share of exports, December 2022–March 2025)  
• Coal: China 44%, India 19%, Turkey 11%, South Korea 10%, Taiwan 5%.  
• Crude oil: China 47%, India 38%, EU 6%, Turkey 6%.  
• Oil products: Turkey 26%, China 13%, Brazil 12%.  
• LNG: EU 50%, China 21%, Japan 19%.  
• Pipeline gas: EU 38%, China 29%, Turkey 27%.  

March 2025 country-level highlights  
• China was by far the largest purchaser, accounting for 43% (€6.8 billion/day) of Russia’s export earnings; crude made up 70% (€3.8 billion) of that. China’s seaborne crude imports from Russia rose 42%—their highest since October 2024—and total seaborne imports were up 19% (Russia’s share 12%). Revenues from Chinese imports rose 16%, implying lower Russian crude prices.  
• India imported €4.4 billion/day of Russian fuels (80% crude, €3.5 billion); crude volumes rose 41% to their highest since July 2024, total imports +19%, crude share 36%; revenue +32%.  
• Turkey was third (€2.3 billion/day, 15% of Russia’s export earnings).  
• EU as a whole accounted for 9% (€1.4 billion/day)—half LNG (€706 million).  
• Brazil imported €828 million/day in oil products.  

EU member–state breakdown  
• Hungary: €412 million (pipeline gas €228 million; crude €184 million).  
• France: €314 million (mainly LNG at Dunkerque, much re-exported to Germany).  
• Slovakia: €165 million (crude via Druzhba €101 million; pipeline gas €63 million). Exemption on re-exporting oil products from Russian crude extended to June 2025.  
• Spain: €161 million in LNG.  
• Belgium: €153 million in LNG.  
• Czechia: €132 million in crude—but no deliveries in April after payment-system exemption expired; Orlen and the government will not seek alternative payment methods and plan to end reliance on Russian oil.  

Regional transit note  
• From January 2025, all Russian pipeline gas enters Europe via TurkStream; Ukrainian transit ended December 2024.

**Nigeria's crude oil production rises to hit 99% of OPEC quota**
Nigeria's crude oil production has risen to 99% of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quota, hitting 1.48 million barrels per day (mbpd) in April 2025, according to the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC). This is a significant increase from the 93% recorded in March 2025. The NUPRC noted that the daily average production in April was 1.68 mbopd, comprising 1.48 mbopd of crude oil and 197,607 bopd of condensate. The commission attributed the increase to improved production levels, but did not specify the cause of the decline in March. The report comes as OPEC+ output hikes push oil prices 6% lower.

**ETF 00715L Surges as Geopolitical Conflicts Escalate**
The price of the 00715L ETF, which tracks the S&P GSCI Brent Oil Index, rose 0.34 yuan or 3.58% to 9.84 yuan on May 12, with a trading volume of 71,579 shares, making it the largest traded ETF in the market. This comes as multiple factors, including the resurgence of geopolitical conflicts, the US's trade talks with multiple countries, and the US's oil production reaching a critical point, are expected to impact the energy market's supply and demand balance. According to Reuters, the US and China will hold substantive trade talks over the weekend, with both sides expressing a positive attitude towards the negotiations. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that the two sides have reached an agreement to reduce the US trade deficit, while Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said that the two sides have reached an 'important consensus' and agreed to establish a new economic dialogue forum. US President Trump also hinted that the US may lower tariffs on Chinese goods. However, the US President's 2026 budget proposal, which was released recently, aims to cut funding for carbon capture and renewable energy projects by over $150 billion, indicating a shift towards fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Meanwhile, Diamondback Energy, a US shale oil producer, has lowered its 2025 production forecast due to global economic uncertainty and the OPEC+ supply increase, which has put the US oil production at a critical point. According to Street View Asset Management, despite OPEC's planned production increase, the organization's oil production in April still decreased slightly, mainly due to the US's efforts to restrict Venezuela's oil supply, as well as the decrease in oil supply from Iraq and Libya. Additionally, the recent Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon's southern region and the Indian military's statement that Pakistan's armed forces have launched multiple drone attacks along the Indian western border indicate a growing trend of geopolitical conflicts, which may impact the energy market's supply and demand balance in the future.

**US-China Tariff Reduction Boosts Oil Prices, but Sustainability Uncertain**
The recent announcement by the US and Chinese governments to reduce tariffs has boosted market confidence, leading to a 2.74% increase in Brent crude oil futures and a 2.72% increase in WTI crude oil futures. However, the sustainability of the oil price rebound is uncertain. According to Toshitaka Tazawa, an analyst at Fuji Securities, the market's optimism about the US-China constructive talks may be limited by the OPEC's production increase plan. Additionally, US President Trump's efforts to reduce oil prices to fulfill his energy cost reduction promise may also put pressure on the oil market. Some analysts predict that oil prices will remain low until 2026. Goldman Sachs has predicted that Brent crude oil will average $60 per barrel and WTI crude oil will average $56 per barrel in the remaining time of 2025, and will further decline to $56 per barrel and $52 per barrel respectively in 2026. Trump's upcoming visit to the Middle East may also have an impact on the global oil price. According to Karen Young, a senior research fellow at the Global Energy Policy Center at Columbia University, the Gulf countries may be forced to sell domestic assets to make up for their budget and current account deficits if they cannot increase their export income. This means that low oil prices may not be a sustainable policy for the Gulf countries. Tim Callen, a visiting scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, added that if oil prices continue to decline, the Gulf countries may not be able to fulfill their investment commitments to the US.

**Analysts See Oil Price Recovery Losing Strength Due to Global Surplus**
Analysts believe that the recovery of oil prices is losing strength due to the increasing global surplus. Several OPEC+ countries are increasing production, contributing to a growing excess of oil supply. The price of Brent oil fell below $60 at the beginning of last week after OPEC+ announced a substantial increase in production for June. David Wech, chief economist at Vortexa, said, 'Although OPEC+ and US government policy announcements have been the catalysts for price drops in April and early May, there are clearly worrying signs in the market's fundamental data.' The indicators of demand for conventional liquid oil have been concerning, according to Wech. Data from Vortexa showed that each month has recorded a decrease in annual arrivals of crude oil and marine fuels. The data showed that the arrivals of liquids, excluding GLP+, had an average of 1.8 million barrels per day less in the last months compared to January-April 2024. Barbara Lambrecht, commodities analyst at Commerzbank AG, said, 'However, it is now likely to predict a larger excess of supply, as the global oil demand perspective probably has not improved.' The eight OPEC+ members, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, had been adhering to voluntary production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day since the beginning of 2024. They began to reverse these cuts from April, with large increases of 411,000 barrels per day expected for May and June. The decision to accelerate the return of barrels may be due to this observation. Notably, until June, the combined production targets for the eight nations are expected to increase by 959,000 barrels per day compared to March, according to Vortexa. After the announcement, oil prices fell significantly last week, mainly due to the challenging market fundamentals widely recognized. Notably, the crude oil in the supply chain, stored in tanks and tankers, accumulated significantly, increasing by more than 150 million barrels since mid-February, showed data from Vortexa. 'Significant excess supplies will likely push stocks above that crucial threshold in the next two months,' said Wech. Kazakhstan continues to produce in excess. Kazakhstan's oil production remains significantly above agreed levels, and the country apparently intends to maintain this production in May. The Ministry of Energy of Kazakhstan projects that its daily oil and condensate production will remain stable at 277,000 tons in May, equaling April's production. In March, production reached 260,000 tons per day. The reported production for April and May corresponds to good 2 million barrels per day, according to Commerzbank. The German bank stated that condensate production is approximately 260,000 barrels per day, suggesting a crude oil production of around 1.75 million barrels per day in Kazakhstan. 'The agreed ceiling for May would therefore be exceeded by around 300,000 barrels per day if compensatory cuts are not taken into account,' said Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank, in the report. This increases the risk that Saudi Arabia will also push for a strong increase in oil production in July. The risks of a price drop for oil are therefore increasing even more.

**Geopolitical Tensions Rise, US Oil Production Reaches Critical Point**
Despite OPEC's planned increase in oil production, the organization's oil production in April decreased slightly due to the US's attempt to restrict Venezuela's oil supply, resulting in a decrease in Venezuela's oil supply, as well as a decrease in Iraq's and Libya's oil supply. Additionally, Israel's air strikes on Lebanon's southern region last week, and Pakistan's armed forces' use of drones and other ammunition along the entire western border with India, indicate a growing trend of geopolitical conflicts that may impact the energy market's supply and demand balance. According to media reports, US President Trump's new 2026 budget proposal will cut over $150 billion in support for carbon capture and renewable energy plans, showing that Trump will shift towards fossil fuels and nuclear energy, and away from climate-focused policies. Furthermore, Diamondback Energy, a US shale oil producer, has lowered its 2025 production forecast, citing the double impact of global economic uncertainty and OPEC+ supply increases, which has pushed US oil production to a critical point.

**IMF Revises Global Growth Forecast Downward**
According to a report by 'Camco Invest', the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its growth forecast for the global economy, expecting a 2.8% growth rate in 2025 and 3% in 2026. The IMF has also revised its forecast for Kuwait's economy, expecting a 1.9% growth rate in 2024 and a 3.1% growth rate in 2025. The report attributes the revisions to the impact of recent trade policies, including the direct and indirect effects of these policies through trade links, as well as increased uncertainty and a decline in sentiment. The IMF has also revised its forecast for the Middle East and North Africa region, expecting a 2.6% growth rate in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026. The report notes that the revisions reflect a more gradual resumption of oil production, the continued indirect effects of conflicts, and slower-than-expected progress in structural reforms. According to data from the futures market, the average oil price is expected to be $66.94 per barrel in 2025 and $62.38 per barrel in 2026. The report also expects the advanced economies to experience a decline in growth, with revised forecasts of 1.4% and 1.5% for 2025 and 2026, respectively. The report notes that the revisions reflect significant downward revisions for Canada, Japan, the UK, and the US, while Spain has seen an upward revision.

**The Forgotten Impact of Asian Growth on Global Markets**
Asia is showing its ability to lead the global economic recovery, with two key news stories from the region going largely unnoticed despite their potential to change the economic trajectory. The decline in oil prices following the last OPEC+ meeting and China's new monetary stimulus could become decisive catalysts for market recovery after a turbulent start to the year. The OPEC+ cartel's decision to increase production quotas by 411,000 barrels per day for June has led to a significant drop in crude oil prices, with Brent currently trading at around $63 per barrel, far from the 2022 levels of over $100. This adjustment comes at a time of global economic deceleration, with 2025 global growth forecasts revised downward and an increase in supply exceeding initial expectations. While some analysts fear that this will exacerbate volatility, history suggests that energy markets tend to stabilize after periods of abrupt adjustment. In Asia, where oil represents a significant proportion of production and energy consumption costs, this decline is a considerable economic relief. It is estimated that, with Brent stabilized at around $60-65 per barrel, the cost of oil imports as a percentage of the region's GDP could be reduced to 2.3% in 2025, down from 3.1% in 2024. Additionally, the associated deflationary effects could facilitate a more favorable environment for expansionary policies, allowing regional central banks to lower interest rates without risking price stability. China, aware of this context, has taken a step forward with an ambitious package of monetary stimulus. Among the measures announced are a 50-point reduction in the banking reserve coefficient - freeing up $1 trillion in liquidity - and a reduction in short-term interest rates to 1.4%. These actions aim to boost credit in key sectors such as technological innovation, consumption, and elderly care. Furthermore, funds have been increased for agriculture, small businesses, and technological development, with a total injection exceeding $1.1 trillion. This approach has a dual objective: to support the domestic economy at a critical moment and to strengthen confidence in international markets. The stimulus comes just as China is negotiating with the US over possible adjustments to trade tariffs, in an attempt to ease the tensions that have weighed on bilateral trade. Although the Chinese economy continues to grow, it is doing so at a more moderate pace and below previous years. Beijing appears determined to maintain this growth and avoid letting the weight of geopolitical tensions and trade barriers hinder its recovery capacity. Meanwhile, financial markets remain focused on US political disputes and quarterly results, overlooking the potential impact of these developments on Asia. Ignoring these dynamics could be a colossal mistake. The combination of cheaper oil, China's expansionary monetary policy, and possible relief in US-China trade tensions offers a much more optimistic scenario than many seem to be seeing. It is essential to note that these factors not only affect Asia but also have a global impact. The decline in oil prices could alleviate inflationary pressures in Western economies, facilitating a relaxation of restrictive monetary policies that have dominated in recent years. Similarly, a stronger recovery in Asia could revitalize global trade, particularly in sectors such as technology, where China remains an undisputed leader. However, there are also risks. A greater oil supply in a weak economic growth environment could generate an excess of supply that limits market stabilization prospects. Additionally, while China's stimulus measures are a step in the right direction, its approach remains reactive, and will depend heavily on how negotiations with the US and other international actors evolve. Time will tell if these stimuli and adjustments can consolidate a broader recovery, but what is clear is that Asia is not waiting for the world to decide its fate. If history teaches us anything, it is that great changes often come from where least expected. This time, the change engine could be to the east, in a continent that continues to adapt, innovate, and grow in a challenging environment. Investors would do well to pay attention to these signals before it's too late. Asia is showing its ability to lead the global economic recovery, and recent monetary stimulus and market adjustments are a testament to this. In a world increasingly interconnected, underestimating the impact of these dynamics would be a difficult mistake to justify in the future. The key lies in recognizing opportunities now, before change becomes evident to all.

**Oil Prices Continue to Rise, with Potential for Further Upside**
Oil prices continued to rise on Friday, with Brent crude oil prices reaching $64 per barrel and WTI crude oil prices breaking through the $60 per barrel threshold. The domestic main contract SC2506 also rose in sync with the international market, closing at 472.4 yuan per barrel, a 2.3% increase. According to Spire Research and Consulting's chief oil and chemical researcher, Spire Xiao Ying, the recent domestic oil price rebound is due to the global tariff policy turning favorable, with the US and UK reaching a trade agreement, and the recent global geopolitical tensions, with the US further imposing sanctions on Iran, increasing concerns over oil supply.  According to Country Garden Securities' chief analyst and energy and chemical co-head, Huang Liunan, the recent oil price rebound is expected to continue, with a high probability of a second bottom or near the end of the cycle. However, some experts believe that the impact of US tariff policies on the oil market has not yet ended. 'From the current perspective, the factors driving oil prices to further rise are relatively limited. Although some countries may reach agreements with the US on tariff policies, the impact of tariff policies on the economy and oil consumption will still be felt. In recent months, many institutions have significantly lowered their expectations for global economic growth, and some even believe that the US economy may enter a recession. Under these circumstances, oil demand will be affected. At the same time, OPEC+ has entered an expansion cycle since April, with accelerated expansion starting in May, and the expansion quantity in May and June exceeding expectations, with internal disagreements within the reduction alliance on production policies, and a high probability of continued increase in oil supply. Currently, most institutions expect the oil market to be oversupplied in the second half of the year, which will have a negative impact on oil prices.' said Spire Xiao Ying. Huang Liunan also believes that from a big trend perspective, the oil market in the second quarter of this year may experience repeated trading of 'main countries and economies imposing tariffs on each other, leading to deflation', and the big asset classes may again resonate downward, adding to the OPEC+ expansion, driving oil prices downward. 'However, the current oil-to-gold ratio is soaring, with a cumulative decline of 10% according to the relationship between 2024 oil demand and global economic fluctuations. There is a risk of over-sold in the short term. In the absence of expectations of US-China tariff negotiations, the probability of oil prices experiencing a corrective rebound increases. In addition, the market's widespread speculation about OPEC+ actual production volume still has uncertainty, and the negative impact is limited.' Huang Liunan said, adding that in the long term, oil prices still have potential upside, including the sharp decline in Iranian oil supply under US sanctions, low absolute values of major region inventories, OPEC+ reduction, and slowing down of US shale oil supply growth, all of which will provide support for oil prices to rebound.

The IMF has also revised its forecast for the Middle East and North Africa region, expecting a 2.6% growth rate in 2025 and 3.4% in 2026. The report notes that the revisions reflect a more gradual resumption of oil production, the continued indirect effects of conflicts, and slower-than-expected progress in structural reforms. According to data from the futures market, the average oil price is expected to be $66.94 per barrel in 2025 and $62.38 per barrel in 2026. The report also expects the advanced economies to experience a decline in growth, with revised forecasts of 1.4% and 1.5% for 2025 and 2026, respectively. The report notes that the revisions reflect significant downward revisions for Canada, Japan, the UK, and the US, while Spain has seen an upward revision.

**The Forgotten Impact of Asian Growth on Global Markets**
Asia is showing its ability to lead the global economic recovery, with two key news stories from the region going largely unnoticed despite their potential to change the economic trajectory. The decline in oil prices following the last OPEC+ meeting and China's new monetary stimulus could become decisive catalysts for market recovery after a turbulent start to the year. The OPEC+ cartel's decision to increase production quotas by 411,000 barrels per day for June has led to a significant drop in crude oil prices, with Brent currently trading at around $63 per barrel, far from the 2022 levels of over $100. This adjustment comes at a time of global economic deceleration, with 2025 global growth forecasts revised downward and an increase in supply exceeding initial expectations. While some analysts fear that this will exacerbate volatility, history suggests that energy markets tend to stabilize after periods of abrupt adjustment. In Asia, where oil represents a significant proportion of production and energy consumption costs, this decline is a considerable economic relief. It is estimated that, with Brent stabilized at around $60-65 per barrel, the cost of oil imports as a percentage of the region's GDP could be reduced to 2.3% in 2025, down from 3.1% in 2024. Additionally, the associated deflationary effects could facilitate a more favorable environment for expansionary policies, allowing regional central banks to lower interest rates without risking price stability. China, aware of this context, has taken a step forward with an ambitious package of monetary stimulus. Among the measures announced are a 50-point reduction in the banking reserve coefficient - freeing up $1 trillion in liquidity - and a reduction in short-term interest rates to 1.4%. These actions aim to boost credit in key sectors such as technological innovation, consumption, and elderly care. Furthermore, funds have been increased for agriculture, small businesses, and technological development, with a total injection exceeding $1.1 trillion. This approach has a dual objective: to support the domestic economy at a critical moment and to strengthen confidence in international markets. The stimulus comes just as China is negotiating with the US over possible adjustments to trade tariffs, in an attempt to ease the tensions that have weighed on bilateral trade. Although the Chinese economy continues to grow, it is doing so at a more moderate pace and below previous years. Beijing appears determined to maintain this growth and avoid letting the weight of geopolitical tensions and trade barriers hinder its recovery capacity. Meanwhile, financial markets remain focused on US political disputes and quarterly results, overlooking the potential impact of these developments on Asia. Ignoring these dynamics could be a colossal mistake. The combination of cheaper oil, China's expansionary monetary policy, and possible relief in US-China trade tensions offers a much more optimistic scenario than many seem to be seeing. It is essential to note that these factors not only affect Asia but also have a global impact. The decline in oil prices could alleviate inflationary pressures in Western economies, facilitating a relaxation of restrictive monetary policies that have dominated in recent years. Similarly, a stronger recovery in Asia could revitalize global trade, particularly in sectors such as technology, where China remains an undisputed leader. However, there are also risks. A greater oil supply in a weak economic growth environment could generate an excess of supply that limits market stabilization prospects. Additionally, while China's stimulus measures are a step in the right direction, its approach remains reactive, and will depend heavily on how negotiations with the US and other international actors evolve. Time will tell if these stimuli and adjustments can consolidate a broader recovery, but what is clear is that Asia is not waiting for the world to decide its fate. If history teaches us anything, it is that great changes often come from where least expected. This time, the change engine could be to the east, in a continent that continues to adapt, innovate, and grow in a challenging environment. Investors would do well to pay attention to these signals before it's too late. Asia is showing its ability to lead the global economic recovery, and recent monetary stimulus and market adjustments are a testament to this. In a world increasingly interconnected, underestimating the impact of these dynamics would be a difficult mistake to justify in the future. The key lies in recognizing opportunities now, before change becomes evident to all.

**OPEC sends oil prices reeling, but what's good for Texas drivers may not be for drillers**
The recent decision by OPEC+ to surge production has led to a significant drop in crude oil prices, with Brent falling to $60 per barrel and U.S. crude (West Texas Intermediate) sliding by 2% to settle around $57 per barrel. While this may lead to lower prices at the gas pump for consumers, it is bad news for Texas-based oil producers, who are already struggling with declining returns on oil and gas equities and seasonally adjusted refining margins. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the average breakeven WTI price to support profitable drilling activities in the Permian region of West Texas sits above $60 per barrel. Energy executives have hiked their breakeven pain threshold to justify more drilling in the face of spiking economic uncertainty, but OPEC's decision has pushed down oil prices all over again. 'It definitely magnifies what has already become an uncertain backdrop for oil prices,' said Bracewell LLP energy partner Austin Lee. 'The combination of recent trade policies and the previous output increase from OPEC had already shaken things up and this just adds to that.' The price drop will also impact the oil and gas mergers and acquisitions market, with companies that planned to sell assets pulling them off the market and waiting for a better pricing environment. 'Increasingly, companies that planned to sell assets into what had already been expected to be an active year for oil & gas M&A in 2025 are pulling their assets off the market and are going to wait for a better pricing environment,' said Henry Benton, a Dallas partner at Troutman Pepper Locke LLP.

**Oil Sinks Below $57 On OPEC+ Supply Speculation, Bear Market Deepens - United States Oil Fund (ARCA:USO)**
Crude oil prices have fallen below $57 per barrel, with a 2% decline on Thursday morning, as markets anticipate a potential OPEC+ supply hike and rising economic stress. Since peaking in March 2022, oil prices have plunged 55%, with a 21% drop year-to-date and a 30% decline over the past 12 months, indicating a persistent bear market. David Goldman, head of trading at Novion Global, said reports that Saudi Arabia can endure low prices without supply cuts triggered the sharp sell-off. Goldman Sachs analyst Daan Struyven expects OPEC+ to raise production modestly, but notes that risks are tilted toward a more aggressive ramp-up. The latest GDP report showed the U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter, with Goldman Sachs' economics team now seeing a 45% probability of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said the bearish backdrop is reinforced by structural demand weakness in China and new geopolitical risks, but noted that markets rarely move in straight lines. 'The cure for low oil prices is low oil prices,' Morrison said.

**New York Oil Prices Plummet as US-China Trade Tensions Rise**
New York oil prices plummeted by 3% as the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price fell by 2.63% to $60.42 per barrel. The US trade deficit has reached a record high, and the flow of trade between the US and China has come to a near standstill, raising concerns about a global economic downturn. According to the US Commerce Department, the trade deficit in March was $162 billion, a 9.6% increase from February's $147.8 billion and exceeding market expectations of $146 billion. The surge in consumer goods imports in March, which increased by 27.5% from the previous month, was driven by companies that pre-ordered ahead of Donald Trump's tariff announcement. At the same time, trade has become a stumbling block for the US's first-quarter economic growth. Mizuho's Bob Yager, head of the energy derivatives division, said, 'The flow of trade between China and the US has slowed down to a near freeze, and the situation is getting closer to a global demand collapse.' The US's largest shipping company, UPS, has announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs to reduce costs, citing a decline in Amazon's orders. General Motors has also postponed its conference call to next month, considering the possibility of changes in trade policies. The oil industry is also starting to feel the impact of tariffs. BP, a major oil company in the UK, reported a 48% decline in profits to $14 billion due to a decline in refined and gas trading. ExxonMobil and Chevron are expected to announce their results this week. Without a successful start to US-China trade negotiations, major oil-producing countries are expected to continue to put pressure on oil prices. Ole Hansen, an analyst at Saxo Bank, said, 'OPEC+(OPEC major oil-producing countries' cooperation) increasing production is the worst-case scenario, especially since Kazakhstan is not showing much interest in reducing production.'

**Crude Prices Post Moderate Losses on US-China Trade War and Iranian Nuclear Negotiations**
Crude oil prices posted moderate losses on Monday due to concerns about the US-China trade war and progress in US-Iran nuclear talks. President Trump stated that the US would not lower tariffs on China unless 'they give us something substantial.' Additionally, signs of progress in US-Iran nuclear talks could lead to the US lifting restrictions on Iran's crude exports, which would boost oil supplies and be bearish for crude prices. However, a weaker dollar and strength in the crude crack spread supported crude prices. The crude crack spread rose to a 3-1/2 week high, encouraging refiners to boost their crude purchases and refine the crude into gasoline and distillates. Fears about the oversupply of crude are also weighing on oil prices, with OPEC+ members suggesting accelerating oil output hikes in June. Kazakhstan's energy minister stated that it would not cut its crude production levels and will prioritize national interests over those of OPEC+, which risks angering Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia could boost its crude production to reduce crude prices and punish those OPEC+ members that produce above their assigned limits. Crude prices have a negative carryover from April 3, when OPEC+ said it would boost crude production in May by 411,000 bpd. However, stronger crude demand in China, the world's largest crude importer, supports oil prices. China's March crude imports rose to 12.1 million bpd, the highest since August 2023. The US imposed new sanctions on Russia's oil industry on January 10, which could curb global oil supplies. Russian oil product exports in March rose to a 5-month high of 3.45 million bpd.

**The Leading African Oil Producers In March 2025 - Axadle | Stay Informed With Horn Of Africa Headlines**
The oil industry has experienced significant shifts in recent weeks, influenced by global activities and policies. The OPEC Reference Basket of Crudes (ORB) value declined by $2.81, or 3.7%, to average $74.00/b. Global oil demand projections have taken a downward turn, with an estimated increase of 1.3 mb/d year on year. The impact of new U.S. tariffs looms large, affecting oil consumption patterns in countries like Nigeria and Iran. OPEC predicts transport fuels will grow, with global jet/kerosene demand forecast to increase by about 0.5 mb/d, year-over-year, in each of the next three quarters. Nigeria remains relatively insulated from the direct impact of U.S. tariffs, but the country's economic ramifications are still uncertain. The top 5 African countries that produced the most oil in March 2025 are: 1. Nigeria (1,515 tb/d), 2. Libya (1,262 tb/d), 3. Algeria (912 tb/d), 4. Congo (259 tb/d), and 5. Gabon (222 tb/d). Nigeria maintained the pole position despite a small reduction in its output, while Congo showed a beacon of increase within the tableau.

**US EIA predicts reduced global oil demand from trade tariffs and market uncertainties**
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts a decline in global oil demand growth through 2026 due to recent trade policy developments and oil production changes. According to the EIA's April Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), global oil demand growth is expected to slow down due to uncertainties in energy supply, demand, and prices. The EIA forecasts ongoing growth in US and global oil production, with OPEC+ accelerating its production increases and the US exempting energy from its recent tariffs. However, the agency expects global oil inventories to rise starting mid-2025, leading to a predicted average Brent crude oil price of less than $70/bbl in 2025 and just over $60/bbl in 2026, approximately 10% lower than the March STEO forecast. Additionally, the EIA expects China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods to significantly affect propane exports, leading to reduced export demand and increased propane inventories on the US Gulf Coast. US natural gas demand is forecasted to grow by 4% in 2025, driven by an 18% increase in exports and a 9% rise in residential and commercial consumption for space heating.

**Oil Prices Remain Stable Amid US Tariffs and Global Supply**
The price of oil has remained stable on Thursday, as markets assess the impact of US tariffs. The global supply of oil has also kept prices close to their highest levels. Brent crude oil price fell by 23 cents, or 0.3%, to $73.56 per barrel on Thursday morning. US West Texas Intermediate crude oil price fell by 21 cents, or 0.3%, to $69.44 per barrel. On Tuesday, oil prices rose by about 1% to their highest level since February. PVM analyst Tamas Varga said that the price was not affected by the decline in stock markets and that the price was driven by US tariffs on Venezuela and small US oil and fuel reserves. US President Donald Trump introduced new 25% tariffs on potential buyers of Venezuelan crude oil on Tuesday. On Wednesday, sources reported that the world's largest refinery operator, India's Reliance Industries, would stop importing Venezuelan oil due to Trump's tariffs. 'There have been some fundamental reasons for the recent oil price increase, but we should not jump to conclusions that US trade policy is the one that determines the next barrel price change in the range of $10-15,' Varga added. DBS bank in Asia said that it does not expect prices to rise to the level seen in January 2025, as uncertainty over US policy and the prospect of trade wars reduce demand, said the bank's energy sector team leader Suvro Sarkar. Traders also assessed the impact of Trump's latest news on oil demand, which includes a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks starting next week. 'News from Trump about tariffs on cars may actually be positive for oil prices, as the increase in car prices due to tariffs will slow the transition to newer, fuel-efficient models,' said IG analyst Tony Sycamore.

**Too early to judge the potential impact of Trump's policies on the US petroleum production outlook, says GlobalData poll**
US President Donald Trump's recent executive orders aim to boost domestic oil and gas production and achieve energy independence. However, a GlobalData poll of 236 respondents found that 40% are uncertain about the impact of these orders, while 37% believe the US might see a significant increase in production. The poll was conducted in February and March 2025, and respondents noted that the next few quarterly filings and investor presentations from top producers might provide better insight into the future trend. The US is already producing crude oil and natural gas at record levels, but any notable increase in production might require companies to deviate from their current strategy of observing capital discipline.

**Oil Prices Rise on Weakening Dollar, but Tariffs Limit Gains**
Oil prices rose early on Wednesday, supported by a weakening dollar, but concerns about slowing US economic growth and the impact of tariffs on global economic growth limited gains. According to Reuters, Daniel Haines, a senior analyst at 'ANZ', said that oil has maintained a positive trend despite weak economic expectations, adding: 'This is a sign that demand for crude remains strong in the short term.' The dollar index fell 0.5% to its lowest level of 2025 on Tuesday, supporting oil prices by making it cheaper for buyers than holders of other currencies. However, US stocks, which also affect the oil market, continued to fall on Tuesday, leading to a continued major sell-off in recent months, amid concerns from investors about increased tariffs on imports. Trump's trade policies have shaken global markets, imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico, major oil suppliers, before delaying their implementation, and raising tariffs on China, prompting it to impose retaliatory tariffs. In terms of supply, the US Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday that US crude oil production is expected to reach a new record high this year, exceeding previous estimates, at an average of 13.61 million barrels per day. Additionally, sources in the market reported, citing data from the American Petroleum Institute, that crude oil inventories rose by 4.2 million barrels in the week ending March 7.

**US Trade Policy Causes Uncertainty in Markets**
The US trade policy has caused uncertainty in the markets. The main reason for this trend is the decision by Donald Trump to increase tariffs on goods from several countries, which has raised concerns about retaliatory measures and their negative impact on the real economy. The US dollar has also lost value against most of its peers, with the EUR/USD rate reaching a four-month high. The weakness of the US dollar is not the only reason, as the euro is being supported by rising yields on euro bonds, which are linked to Germany's proposals for massive defense spending. The euro has also been supported by the ECB's upward revision of its short-term inflation forecast. The price of Brent crude oil has fallen to $68.33 per barrel, but showed an upward correction on Friday. The oil prices were under pressure due to the decision by OPEC+ to increase production from April 2025, as well as concerns about the prospects for the global economy due to the US trade policy. The US inflation rate remains above the Fed's target, but analysts expect it to decline slightly for the reporting period, allowing the Fed to maintain its tight monetary policy, which is good news for the US dollar. The high energy prices and high inflation are still having a negative impact on the British economy, with the purchasing manager index for the manufacturing sector remaining in the contraction zone. Global analysts expect a slowdown in GDP growth compared to the previous month, which means that the Bank of England will be forced to loosen its monetary policy to boost economic growth, which is bad news for the British pound. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index has fallen in the last three months, despite the US economy showing no signs of cooling. Americans are increasingly concerned about their future prospects due to high inflation, which is bad news for the US dollar, but good news for US dollar-denominated assets like gold.

**OPEC Discusses Trump's Tariff Policy Impact: Market Uncertainty Increases**
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has maintained its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2025, but notes that US President Trump's trade policies have increased market uncertainty. In its latest monthly report, OPEC mentions that Trump's new tariffs have added to market uncertainty, which may lead to a supply-demand imbalance and make it difficult to reflect the market fundamentals, resulting in greater volatility. OPEC predicts that global oil demand will grow by 1.45 million barrels per day this year and 1.43 million barrels per day next year, mainly driven by strong air travel and road transportation consumption of transportation fuels. The organization's overall forecast is more optimistic than other institutions, with the International Energy Agency estimating that global oil demand will increase by 1.05 million barrels per day this year. The Brent crude oil futures price was around $75 per barrel on Wednesday, as reports suggested that US oil inventories had increased significantly. The future price trend remains uncertain, with traders continuing to monitor the US government's tariff announcements, fearing that trade tensions may escalate and harm global economic growth and suppress oil demand. The White House has stated that Trump may announce his reciprocal tariff plan before meeting with Indian Prime Minister Modi on Thursday. Last Monday, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all imported steel and aluminum to the US, which is expected to take effect in mid-March. Despite Trump's call for lower oil prices, OPEC+ leaders did not propose any changes to the current oil production policy at their meeting earlier this month. OPEC+ produces nearly half of the world's total oil output. OPEC+ initially planned to increase production from October 2024, but has delayed the increase twice due to low international oil prices. The organization now plans to increase production in April 2025. Some market observers believe that Trump's trade policies may prompt OPEC+ to extend its current production cut agreement. However, the organization may also decide to start increasing production to offset any potential gaps caused by US sanctions on Russia and Iran. Trump has signed a directive to restore the 'maximum pressure' on Iran, and the White House will implement a plan to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero. OPEC has maintained its forecast for global economic growth of 3.1% this year and 3.2% next year unchanged. It predicts that the eurozone economy will grow at 0.9% in 2025, 1.1% in 2026, while the US economy is expected to grow at 2.4% and 2.3% in the next two years. The organization notes that trade policy uncertainty has made inflation expectations exceed the main central banks' targets, making it more difficult to reduce interest rates in 2025. The impact of US trade policies on global macroeconomic growth is still to be observed.

**US Energy Sector Sees Strong Rebound in 2025, But Analysts Remain Pessimistic**
The US energy sector has seen a strong rebound in the first seven trading days of 2025, with a gain of over 5%, making it the best-performing S&P 500 sector so far this year. The increase is attributed to the surge in natural gas prices due to the US winter and the Biden administration's full-scale sanctions on Russian oil exports, which have pushed oil prices above $80 per barrel. Additionally, the growing demand for electricity due to the development of AI data centers has boosted the stock prices of nuclear power companies, such as Constellation Energy and Vistra, with gains of 24.82% and 17.60% respectively. However, Wall Street analysts remain pessimistic about the long-term prospects of the energy sector. According to US Bank analysts, the OPEC+ decision to extend the voluntary production cut of 2.2 million barrels per day until March 2025 will limit the impact of oil price increases, making it unlikely for the energy sector to continue its upward trend. Morgan Stanley and Citi analysts also predict that Brent crude oil futures will decline to $70 per barrel in the first quarter of 2025, from the current price of $81 per barrel.

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:

1. **Macrotrends** - Historical chart based on EIA data showing production through February 2022 in thousand barrels per day. Source is credible but outdated for our forecast.

2. **OilMonster** - Shows U.S. crude oil production at 409,344 thousand barrels for July 2024. This is a potentially useful recent data point from an aggregator of EIA data.

3. **Statista** - Commercial statistics database with data through June 2024. Lacks specific figures in the excerpt provided.

4. **NPR article (Jan 22, 2025)** - Reports on Trump's "national energy emergency" declaration (Jan 20, 2025). Factual reporting from a credible news source, with expert commentary from energy historian Daniel Yergin noting that such measures have historically included limited regulatory suspensions.

5. **Center for American Progress (Feb 10, 2025)** - Progressive think tank article stating the U.S. is producing more crude oil than ever. Contains some partisan framing but cites factual production data and quotes from credible sources including the New York Times and Reuters.

6. **Atlantic Council (Jan 22, 2025)** - Nonpartisan think tank analysis of Trump's energy policies with expert commentary suggesting immediate production increases would be limited by regulatory timelines and market conditions.

7. **Perplexity Report** - AI-generated summary citing production data through March 2025. Reports 13.50 million barrels per day for March 2025 and describes seasonal patterns. Most directly relevant but requires verification against other sources.

## Reference Class Analysis:

1. **Recent monthly U.S. oil production (2024-early 2025)**: Most relevant reference class as it captures current technology, market dynamics, and the initial impact of new energy policies.

2. **Seasonal production patterns**: The Perplexity report indicates consistent winter declines followed by spring recovery, which is relevant for March forecasting.

3. **Production response to policy changes**: Less relevant for immediate forecasting as the Atlantic Council experts note regulatory changes take time to implement.

I'll primarily use the first two reference classes, focusing on recent production and seasonal patterns.

## Timeframe Analysis:

Our forecast is for March 2025, which is in the past relative to our current date (May 12, 2025), but official finalized data may not yet be available.

Key patterns from the Perplexity report:
- Production declined in January 2025 (13.15 mb/d) due to winter weather
- February 2025 showed minimal recovery (13.16 mb/d)
- March 2025 rebounded to 13.50 mb/d, consistent with typical spring recovery patterns

The January 20, 2025 energy emergency declaration would likely have minimal impact on March production given the implementation timeline noted by Atlantic Council experts.

## Justification:

To calculate total March 2025 production in thousand barrels:
- Daily rate: 13.50 million barrels per day (from Perplexity)
- Number of days in March: 31
- Total production: 13.50 × 31 = 418.5 million barrels = 418,500 thousand barrels

This figure is consistent with:
1. The July 2024 benchmark of 409,344 thousand barrels (OilMonster)
2. The statement that U.S. is producing at historically high levels (Center for American Progress)
3. The expected seasonal pattern of March recovery from winter lows
4. The realistic timeframe for policy implementation (Atlantic Council expert analysis)

The figure falls within the expected range of 300,000-500,000 thousand barrels.

# Outside view calibration:

I'll create a probability distribution centered around 418,500 thousand barrels, with appropriate uncertainty:

1. **Central tendency**: Based on the Perplexity report's 13.50 mb/d figure for March 2025, which aligns with seasonal patterns and recent production levels.

2. **Uncertainty factors**:
   - Potential EIA data revisions (typically up to ±2-3%)
   - Weather disruptions or operational issues in March
   - Market conditions affecting production decisions
   - Early implementation of some regulatory changes

3. **Historical volatility**: The Perplexity report shows month-to-month variations of approximately 2-3%, but larger deviations are possible.

4. **Seasonal considerations**: March typically shows recovery from winter production challenges.

I'll use a moderately wide distribution to account for these uncertainties, with approximately ±5.5% for my 90% confidence interval.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Macrotrends**: Historical U.S. crude oil production data sourced from EIA. Last data point is February 2022 (11,600 thousand barrels per day), making it outdated for our forecast.

2. **OilMonster**: Aggregates EIA data on U.S. crude oil production. Shows July 2024 production at 409,344 thousand barrels, providing a relatively recent reference point in our target units.

3. **Statista**: Offers U.S. monthly oil production by oilfield from June 2021 to June 2024. Limited usefulness without actual figures or more recent data.

4. **NPR Article (Jan 22, 2025)**: Reports on Trump's "national energy emergency" declaration. High-quality recent source that includes factual reporting on policy changes and expert opinions from energy historian Daniel Yergin and the Brennan Center regarding implementation challenges.

5. **Center for American Progress (Feb 10, 2025)**: Progressive think tank analysis arguing opening more federal lands won't lower energy prices. Contains factual data on U.S. production levels and leased acreage, plus credible third-party opinions from the New York Times and Reuters noting industry executives' reluctance to increase production without higher prices.

6. **Atlantic Council (Jan 22, 2025)**: Expert analysis of Trump's energy policies from a respected nonpartisan think tank. Includes valuable expert opinions from named specialists (Reed Blakemore, David Goldwyn, Andrea Clabough) explaining that regulatory changes take time and production increases depend on market conditions despite policy signals.

7. **Perplexity Report (May 2025)**: Most current source, providing data through March 2025. Reports March 2025 production at 13.50 million barrels per day (approximately 418,500 thousand barrels for the month) and details recent monthly trends showing seasonal patterns.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

1. **Recent Production Levels**: The most directly relevant reference class is U.S. crude oil production in the months immediately preceding March 2025. The Perplexity report provides monthly data showing October 2024 through March 2025 production levels, with March 2025 at 13.50 million barrels per day.

2. **Seasonal Patterns**: U.S. oil production demonstrates consistent seasonal fluctuations, with winter declines (especially January) followed by spring recovery. The reported figures show this pattern with January 2025 production dropping 13.7% from December before rebounding in March.

3. **Policy Environment Impacts**: While Trump's January 2025 energy emergency declaration aimed to boost production, expert opinions from Atlantic Council indicate minimal short-term impact due to implementation delays, regulatory processes, and market-driven investment decisions.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: The combination of recent production data and seasonal patterns provides the most reliable basis for forecasting March 2025 production, as it incorporates actual trends while accounting for typical month-to-month variations.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

We are forecasting March 2025 production on May 12, 2025—approximately 2 months after the period in question. This timeframe has several implications:

1. The event has already occurred, but official EIA data for March 2025 might still be preliminary or subject to revision.

2. Monthly data from October 2024 to March 2025 shows significant variation:
   - October 2024: 13.436 mb/d
   - November 2024: 13.352 mb/d
   - December 2024: 13.451 mb/d
   - January 2025: 13.15 mb/d (winter weather impact)
   - February 2025: 13.16 mb/d
   - March 2025: 13.50 mb/d

3. The 10.6% drop from December 2024 to January 2025 followed by recovery in March aligns with typical seasonal patterns in U.S. oil production.

4. The Perplexity report indicates U.S. production remains on an upward trajectory overall, with the EIA anticipating a 13.61 mb/d annual average for 2025.

## (d) Justification

Based on the analysis above, my outside view prediction centers on the reported March 2025 production of 13.50 million barrels per day, which translates to approximately 418,500 thousand barrels for the 31-day month (13.50 × 31).

This estimate is supported by:

1. The reported figure comes from the most current source (Perplexity, May 2025), which aligns with typical EIA reporting timelines.

2. The March 2025 figure shows expected seasonal recovery from winter production declines, consistent with historical patterns.

3. The 418,500 thousand barrels estimate is comparable to the July 2024 production of 409,344 thousand barrels mentioned in the OilMonster source, showing reasonable growth over an 8-month period.

4. While Trump's January 2025 energy policy changes aimed to boost production, expert opinions from multiple sources indicate that significant production increases would require time for implementation and favorable market conditions.

5. The March 2025 figure aligns with the EIA's 2025 annual average forecast of 13.61 mb/d, suggesting it is a reasonable representation of current production levels.

# Outside view calibration:

To develop a probability distribution for March 2025 crude oil production, I'll calibrate around the central estimate of 418,500 thousand barrels while accounting for uncertainty:

1. **Central tendency**: The reported March 2025 production (13.50 mb/d × 31 days = 418,500 thousand barrels) provides our median.

2. **Uncertainty sources**:
   - Potential data revisions: EIA frequently updates preliminary figures as more complete data becomes available
   - Month-to-month volatility: Recent data shows normal variations of ±2-3% with occasional larger swings due to weather or other disruptions
   - Data collection and reporting lags: As we're only two months past March, some uncertainty in the reported figure is likely

3. **Distribution shape**: I'll use a slightly right-skewed distribution to reflect that:
   - March already showed recovery from winter lows, limiting downside potential
   - The policy environment supports increased production, though with limited short-term impact
   - Abrupt production increases are constrained by industry capital discipline and technical factors

4. **Confidence intervals**: For my 80% confidence interval (P10 to P90), I'll use approximately ±5% from the central estimate, with wider tails to account for less likely but possible scenarios.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Macrotrends (uses EIA data, monthly crude‐oil production as daily averages since 1983). High-quality primary data source for historical daily production. No March 2025 yet.  
- OilMonster (extracts EIA data back to 1920; shows July 2024 monthly total of 409,344 thousand barrels). Authoritative but excerpt lacks March 2025.  
- Statista (offers monthly by basin June 2021–June 2024 behind paywall). No March 2025 figures; secondary aggregator.  
- NPR (Jan 2025 article on Trump’s “national energy emergency”). Opinion plus some historical context; no hard production figures for March 2025. Treat expert quotes (Yergin) as background, not data.  
- Center for American Progress (Feb 2025 analysis arguing new drilling won’t necessarily raise output). Opinion piece; industry insiders’ views are unnamed, so discount for hard forecast.  
- Atlantic Council (Jan 2025 experts on Trump’s orders). Well-sourced expert commentary on regulatory process; no hard March 2025 volume. Useful for understanding lead times on policy effects.  
- Perplexity report (claims EIA STEO: March 2025 daily avg ~13.50 mb/d, monthly total ~418,500 thousand barrels). Details EIA methodology; likely reliable but mix of weekly vs. monthly estimates.  

2. Reference-class analysis  
- Reference class A: All US monthly total crude production (thousand barrels) for the last 36 months. Good for overall variability but includes strong seasonality (winter dips).  
- Reference class B: March totals for 2018–2024. Captures seasonality in March, with rising trend. Values approx:  
  • Mar 2018: ~334,000  
  • Mar 2019: ~346,000  
  • Mar 2020: ~311,000  
  • Mar 2021: ~343,000  
  • Mar 2022: ~369,000  
  • Mar 2023: ~384,000  
  • Mar 2024: ~409,000  
Trend: ~+25,000 thousand barrels per year from 2021–2024. This is most suitable for forecasting March 2025.  
- Reference class C: Daily-average seasonal series (Feb–Apr) of 2022–2025, then converted to month totals. Similar but less directly tied to March.  

We select reference class B as best in-sample March analogs.

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Today: May 12 2025. EIA will publish March 2025 monthly data within days.  
- Historical pattern: Production peaks in late year, dips in January, recovers in February/March. The February 2025 daily avg was ~13.16 mb/d (monthly total ~367,000 for 28 days), suggesting March recovery to perhaps 13.3–13.4 mb/d.  

4. Justification for outside-view prediction  
- Trend line from March 2021–2024 adds ~25,000 thousand barrels per year: 409,000 (Mar 2024) + 25,000 ≈ 434,000 for Mar 2025.  
- But actual winter pattern: December 2024 peak at ~13.45 mb/d (417k total), January dip to ~13.15 (408k), February slight recovery but still weather-impacted (368k total). March typically rebounds modestly (≈1.5% above February daily avg).  
- If Feb daily avg ≈13.16, +1.5% seasonality ⇒ Mar daily avg ≈13.36 mb/d ⇒ total ≈13.36×31 = 414,000.  
- EIA STEO’s March forecast of 13.61 mb/d annual average doesn’t directly give March daily avg; global oversupply and moderate prices suggest growth but not a sudden spike.  
- Policy changes (Trump emergency) likely take months to influence drilling rates; unlikely to affect March.  
- Combining trend (+25k) and seasonality (−20k from trend due to winter carryover) ⇒ around 414k.  

Outside view calibration:  
- We want a distribution reflecting both trend uncertainty and seasonal variability.  
- Historical inter-annual March growth standard deviation: roughly ±7,000 thousand barrels. Seasonal rebound variance: ±5,000. Combine to ±9,000 (1σ).  
- For a 90% interval (≈1.65σ): ±15,000. Center ≈414,000 ⇒ [399,000, 429,000].  
- We widen slightly for unknowns: use ±18,000 for P10–P90.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Macrotrends (uses EIA data; covers up to Feb 2022): Solid historical series for context but out-of-date for our question. Gives daily-average rates (thousand b/d) through early 2022.  
- OilMonster (pulls EIA data; snapshot July 2024 at 409,344 thousand barrels monthly total): Reliable source attribution, but only July 2024. No March 2025.  
- Statista (paywalled; shows region breakdown through June 2024): Data likely reliable but inaccessible. No March 2025 figures.  
- NPR (Jan 2025 article on “national energy emergency”): High-quality journalism; contains policy context and expert commentary on Trump’s executive actions. No direct production figures but indicates policy tailwinds for higher production in 2025.  
- Center for American Progress (Feb 2025 policy analysis): Opinion piece; well-sourced statistics on lease utilization and industry incentives. Experts caution that regulatory rollbacks alone don’t guarantee output growth.  
- Atlantic Council (Jan 2025 expert Q&A): Reputable think-tank. Experts note that actual production increases depend on capital decisions, permitting timelines, and legal challenges—likely gradual rather than instant.  
- Perplexity report (EIA STEO, weekly/monthly through Mar 2025): Aggregates EIA forecasts and weekly data. Reports a record 13.451 mb/d in Dec 2024; 13.16 mb/d in Feb 2025; rebounds to 13.50 mb/d in Mar 2025 (monthly average). Useful but requires validation against official monthly release.  

In sum, our best quantitative anchor is the EIA-derived daily averages (~13.5 mb/d in Mar 2025) implied by the Perplexity report, supported by weekly EIA releases. Policy sources suggest modest upside potential vs. winter downturn, but no large shocks are evident.

2. Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
 a. Monthly U.S. total crude oil production (monthly-total, 12-month series).  
 b. Monthly average daily production (thousand b/d) series.  
 c. Monthly totals for March in prior years (to capture seasonality).  

Most suitable: the rolling last 12 months of monthly totals (in thousand barrels), since it captures both trend and seasonality. March typically shows a recovery from January/February lows. Over the past year, monthly totals ranged roughly 390,000–420,000 thousand barrels.

3. Timeframe analysis  
- Forecast date: May 12 2025; we look back one full month (March 2025).  
- Historical pattern:  
  • December highs (420k–430k) → January troughs (~380k–390k) → February slight recovery (~390k–400k) → March rebound (~405k–415k).  
  • Year-over-year March change small, ±1–3%.

4. Justification for outside view prediction  
- Base-rate (daily average): ~13.50 mb/d in March 2025 per EIA‐based reports.  
- Convert to monthly total: 13,500 thousand b/d × 31 days = 418,500 thousand barrels.  
- Seasonality: March gains ~5% from February’s average. February 2025 at 13.16 mb/d → 408,000 thousand barrels; +2.6% yields ~418,500.  
- Policy context: Trump’s emergency order may accelerate permitting, but legal delays and capital discipline imply no abrupt spike.  
- Volatility: Monthly totals historically vary ±2–3% month-to-month in non-crisis periods.  
- Uncertainty factors: weather, minor OPEC+ decisions, equipment downtime.

Outside view calibration:

We adopt a 90/10 interval wide enough to cover weather or policy lags, but not so wide as to ignore the tight long-run trend. The central estimate is 418,500 thousand barrels, with approximately ±3% (80% mass) and ±5% (90% mass).

Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  

1. Macrotrends chart (updated through Feb 2025).  
   • Factual content: monthly U.S. crude-oil field production (thousand b/d) taken directly from the EIA.  
   • Opinions: none.  
   • Quality: good for historic levels, but only current through the latest EIA release (Feb 2025).  

2. OilMonster table (last value July 2024 = 409 344 kbbl).  
   • Simply repackages EIA numbers.  
   • Quality: adequate; behind on updates; no opinions.  

3. Statista page (data pay-walled, ends June 2024).  
   • Adds no new facts for 2025.  
   • Quality: neutral; ignore for the forecast.  

4. NPR article on the 20 Jan 2025 “national energy emergency”.  
   • Facts: declaration occurred; outlines possible regulatory roll-backs.  
   • Opinions: journalists and policy experts debate impact.  
   • For March-2025 production the order is too recent to move the needle; at most it nudges sentiment.  

5. Center for American Progress (10 Feb 2025) – advocacy piece.  
   • Facts: EIA confirms record U.S. output.  
   • Opinions: expanding leasing will not cut prices.  
   • Limited value for an immediate one-month production forecast.  

6. Atlantic Council Q&A (22 Jan 2025).  
   • Experts: Goldwyn, Blakemore, Clabough.  
   • Consensus: executive action’s real impact comes later; short-run output change driven by price & Permian productivity.  
   • Relevant: reinforces expectation that March 2025 will follow pre-existing trend rather than see a step-change.  

7. Perplexity synthesis (March 2025 STEO & weekly data).  
   • Factual nuggets:  
     – EIA STEO (Mar 2025) raises 2025 annual forecast to 13.61 mb/d.  
     – Dec 2024 record: 13.451 mb/d (≈-429 660 kbbl).  
     – Preliminary estimates: Jan 2025 13.15 mb/d; Feb 2025 13.16 mb/d; Mar 2025 weekly-derived rebound to about 13.50 mb/d.  
   • Quality: mixed (secondary synthesis).  The daily rates are in line with the official weekly series, so they provide a reasonable anchor.  

Overall: the only hard numbers up to Feb 2025 are the EIA monthly releases.  For March 2025 we must extrapolate from the weekly series and from the multi-year seasonal pattern.  No expert source claims a structural jump or collapse for March itself.

(b)  Reference class analysis  

Candidate classes  
1. “Same-month year-over-year change” (March 2014-2024).  
2. “Ratio of March to the preceding December” (captures winter effect & short-term trend).  
3. “Straight continuation of weekly production (EIA Weekly Petroleum Status) into the final monthly total.”  

Suitability  
• Class 1 captures macro growth but ignores recent winter dips.  
• Class 2 removes the price-cycle noise and isolates the recurring winter rebound—best for seasonality.  
• Class 3 folds in the freshest high-frequency data.  

I use a weighted blend: 40 % class 2 (seasonal ratio), 60 % class 3 (weekly continuation), because weekly data are the closest proxy yet still subject to survey noise.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  

We are forecasting a number that will be published in early June 2025—roughly 3-4 weeks ahead.  
Looking backward ten years:  
• March is nearly always below the preceding December (median gap ≈ –4 %).  
• But U.S. production has been rising, so March is generally above the previous September by ≈ +2 %.  
• Weekly data show an upswing from 13.16 mb/d in Feb to ~13.50 mb/d by late March 2025.  

(d)  Justification for outside-view baseline  

Step 1 – Translate weekly March-2025 average:  
13.50 mb/d × 31 days = 418 500 kbbl.  

Step 2 – Cross-check with seasonality:  
Dec 2024 final = 429 700 kbbl (13.86 mb/d).  
Historic median (2014-2024) March/December ratio ≈ 0.96.  
0.96 × 429 700 ≈ 412 000 kbbl.  

Step 3 – Blend (60 % weekly-based, 40 % seasonal):  
0.60 × 418 500 + 0.40 × 412 000 ≈ 415 900 kbbl.  

Step 4 – Apply growth drift (Permian drilling still adding rigs; WTI hovered near 81 $/bbl in March): +1 % ⇒ 420 000 kbbl central estimate.  

Uncertainty drivers  
• Final EIA reconciliation can revise weekly-implied volumes ±2 %.  
• Possible unreported shut-ins from intermittent Permian weather/bottlenecks.  
• Data-revision risk higher in winter/spring months (historical 90 % revision band ±3.5 %).  

Outside view calibration:

Past five years, the absolute month-to-month revision scatter (final vs. first print) has a std-dev ≈ 1.3 % of volume.  I widen that modestly because we only have weekly inputs, not the initial monthly print yet.  Hence I assign a 90 % interval of ±5 % around the point estimate.

Point estimate: 420 000 kbbl  
5 % low end: ~399 000 kbbl  
5 % high end: ~441 000 kbbl

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:

1. **OilPrice.com (March 31, 2025)** - Reports EIA data showing January 2025 US crude production fell to 13.15 million barrels per day (bpd), the lowest in 15 months. December 2024 production was revised to 13.45 million bpd. Highly relevant, credible source reporting official data.

2. **IEA Oil Market Report (March 13, 2025)** - States the US is at "record production levels" and forecasts it to be the largest source of global supply growth in 2025. Highly credible international agency.

3. **Dallas Fed Energy Survey (Q1 2025)** - Survey conducted March 12-20 shows oil production index rose from 1.1 to 5.6 quarter-on-quarter, indicating expanding production. Credible regional economic data.

4. **EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook via O&G Journal (March 12, 2025)** - Projects rising US production with Brent prices expected to reach $75/barrel by Q3 2025. Authoritative forecast from primary data source.

5. **JKempEnergy (March 12, 2025)** - Analysis by respected energy analyst John Kemp indicating US drillers beginning to shift focus from oil to gas due to price signals. Credible expert opinion.

6. **Recent news articles (May 2025)** - Multiple sources mention Diamondback Energy lowering its 2025 production forecast and US production reaching a "critical point" due to global economic uncertainty and OPEC+ supply increases. These reflect conditions after our target date.

## Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- January 2025 production at 13.15 million bpd (EIA via OilPrice.com)
- US at "record production levels" in March 2025 (IEA)
- Oil production index rose from 1.1 to 5.6 in Q1 2025 (Dallas Fed)
- US crude production expected to average 13.61 million bpd in 2025 (EIA forecast from March)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Beginning shift from oil to gas drilling (JKempEnergy)
- Recovery from January lows consistent with seasonal patterns
- Ongoing momentum in US production despite price pressures

**Weak Evidence:**
- Subsequent production concerns (Diamondback lowering forecast) reflect post-March developments
- General price commentary and global supply-demand dynamics

## Timeframe Analysis:

The forecast is for March 2025, which is approximately 2 months before the current date in the scenario (May 12, 2025). The EIA typically releases monthly crude oil production data with a 2-month lag, so final figures may just be becoming available.

If the timeframe were halved (February 2025), we would rely more heavily on the January data point and early Q1 trends, likely resulting in a lower estimate as recovery from January lows would be partial.

If the timeframe were doubled (May 2025), we would need to account for emerging headwinds like the shift to gas drilling, OPEC+ production increases, and their impact on US production decisions, potentially resulting in a lower estimate.

## Justification:

Starting with January 2025's 13.15 million bpd, evidence strongly suggests March production increased due to:

1. Recovery from winter-related challenges (seasonal pattern)
2. Dallas Fed survey showing rising production throughout Q1
3. IEA's explicit statement about "record production levels" in March

To convert to total monthly production:
- March has 31 days
- If March production was in the 13.5-13.7 million bpd range (reflecting recovery to near or above December's 13.45 million bpd)
- Total would be: 13.5-13.7 million bpd × 31 days = 418,500-424,700 thousand barrels

The "record production levels" statement from IEA suggests March likely exceeded December's 13.45 million bpd, while emerging headwinds kept it from dramatically exceeding the 2025 forecast average of 13.61 million bpd.

# Probability Calibration:

Given the strong evidence for recovery from January lows, the IEA's "record production" statement, and the Dallas Fed's indication of expanding production in Q1, I estimate March 2025 production centered around 421,000 thousand barrels, with a 90% confidence interval of approximately ±5% to account for:

- Potential EIA data revisions
- Uncertainty about the exact pace of recovery from January lows
- Possible unidentified disruptions in March
- Normal month-to-month production variability

I've widened the tails of the distribution to account for greater uncertainty in extreme scenarios, such as major retrospective data revisions or unreported production issues.

# Checklist:
1. Target: US crude oil production in March 2025 in thousand barrels per EIA data
2. Outside view: January 2025 was 407,650 thousand barrels (13.15 million bpd × 31 days), with seasonal recovery expected
3. Consistency: Implied median ≈421,000 thousand barrels aligns with evidence of recovery and "record production" statement
4. Key evidence: January at 13.15 million bpd; IEA's "record levels" statement; Dallas Fed's rising production index; emerging shift to gas drilling
5. Blind spot: Significant retrospective EIA data revisions could push outcome lower if unreported disruptions occurred

   - Key facts: Oil production index rose from 1.1 to 5.6; industry breakeven price ~$65/barrel; company outlook index fell to -4.9
   - Factual reporting of industry sentiment rather than individual opinions

4. **EIA March STEO via O&G Journal** (March 12, 2025)
   - Medium-high reliability reporting on official EIA forecasts
   - Very recent reporting
   - Key facts: EIA expects global inventories to tighten in Q2, then rebuild as OPEC+ unwinds cuts and non-OPEC output grows
   - Expert projection: Brent price forecast to rise to ~$75/barrel by Q3 2025

5. **OilPrice.com US Oil Output article** (March 31, 2025)
   - Medium-high reliability; reporting specific EIA data
   - Recent and relevant reporting
   - Key facts: January 2025 production fell by 305,000 bpd to 13.15 million bpd; December 2024 production revised down to 13.45 million bpd
   - No significant expert opinions

6. **AskNews articles** (May 2025)
   - Multiple recent articles from May 2025
   - Key facts: Diamondback Energy lowered 2025 production forecast; US production reached "critical point"; Goldman Sachs forecasts lower oil prices
   - Expert opinions: Analysts at Fuji Securities, Global Energy Policy Center, and Dallas Fed regarding price pressures and production outlook

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- January 2025 US production was 13.15 million bpd, down from 13.45 million bpd in December 2024 (EIA data via OilPrice.com)
- Dallas Fed survey showed oil production index rising in Q1 2025 (from 1.1 to 5.6), indicating production growth
- IEA reported US was at "record production levels" and forecast to be largest source of supply growth in 2025
- Permian Basin breakeven price is ~$65/barrel (Dallas Fed), while WTI has been trading below that level (~$57-60/barrel) in recent months
- Multiple sources indicate a shift from oil to gas drilling due to relative price changes

**Moderate evidence:**
- Diamondback Energy lowered its 2025 production forecast due to economic uncertainty and OPEC+ supply increases
- Industry sentiment turned slightly negative (Dallas Fed outlook index at -4.9)
- US-China tariff reduction announcement in May could improve economic conditions
- Trump's budget proposal signaling shift toward fossil fuels (though impacts would be longer-term)

**Weak evidence:**
- Some articles characterize US production as reaching a "critical point" without specific metrics
- Conflicting signals on how quickly producers are responding to price changes
- Uncertain impact of geopolitical tensions on production decisions

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

We are making this forecast on May 12, 2025 for production that occurred in March 2025 – approximately 6 weeks after the period in question. This means:

1. Data for the period has already been collected and reported by the EIA, though it could still be preliminary and subject to revision
2. If the timeframe was halved (forecasting just 3 weeks after March), our confidence would increase slightly as there would be less time for data revisions
3. If the timeframe was doubled (forecasting 12 weeks after March), our confidence would increase as EIA revisions are typically finalized within 2-3 months

## (d) Justification

The most critical piece of information comes from the Perplexity Report (May 2025), which explicitly states: "March 2025 production at 13.50 million barrels per day (approximately 418,500 thousand barrels for the month)."

This represents a significant recovery from January's 13.15 million bpd, which was described as "the lowest monthly level in over a year." The recovery aligns with normal seasonal patterns, where production typically rebounds from winter lows.

The Dallas Fed's rising production index in Q1 2025 supports this recovery. However, there are some constraining factors:
- Oil prices below the $65/barrel breakeven level for many producers
- Industry shift toward gas drilling due to more favorable economics
- Slightly pessimistic industry outlook

Given these factors, I'll use the reported March 2025 figure of 418,500 thousand barrels as my central estimate, with uncertainty reflecting potential data revisions and conflicting market signals.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the central estimate of 418,500 thousand barrels for March 2025, I'll build a probability distribution that accounts for:

1. **Potential data revisions**: EIA data is often revised (December 2024 was revised down by 40,000 bpd)
2. **Uncertainty in reporting accuracy**: The reported figure is recent and potentially preliminary
3. **Conflicting market signals**: Strong production growth indicators versus price pressures and industry caution

The distribution will be slightly right-skewed given:
- March figure already shows recovery from January lows, limiting downside
- Reported figure comes from a recent source (May 2025)
- Most recent EIA revisions have been downward (December was revised down)

My 80% confidence interval (P10-P90) spans approximately ±4.5% from the median, reflecting moderate uncertainty appropriate for recently reported data that might still be revised.

The 98% confidence interval (P1-P99) spans approximately ±7.8%, allowing for more extreme revisions or reporting errors.

# Checklist:
1. Target: US crude oil production in March 2025 in thousand barrels (total monthly production)
2. Outside view: March 2025 production reported at 418,500 thousand barrels (Perplexity Report, May 2025)
3. Consistency: Median = 418,500; distribution slightly right-skewed due to recovery from winter lows
4. Key evidence: (a) March 2025 production reported at 13.50 million bpd (b) January 2025 was 13.15 million bpd (c) Dallas Fed showed rising production index in Q1 (d) Oil prices below many producers' breakeven levels
5. Blind spot: EIA could make larger-than-expected downward revisions due to deteriorating market conditions in late March

Analysis:

1. Target variable  
Monthly total U.S. crude oil production in March 2025, in thousand barrels (as measured by the EIA).

2. Source analysis  
• John Kemp (March 12, 2025) – “U.S. drillers set to switch focus from oil to gas in 2025.” High credibility; analysis of futures positioning and E&P incentives. Fact: signals pivot to gas may slow oil growth. (Moderate relevance.)  
• IEA Oil Market Report (March 13, 2025) – Global supply/demand, notes U.S. at record production and forecast largest supply growth in 2025. Highly credible; uses hard data. (Strong relevance.)  
• Dallas Fed Energy Survey Q1 2025 (March 20, 2025) – Oil production index ↑ in Q1 vs Q4. Primary survey of 130 firms. (Moderate relevance.)  
• O&G Journal on EIA STEO (March 12, 2025) – Summarizes EIA STEO: inventories tighten in Q2, U.S. tariffs on Mexican/Canadian oil, largest supply growth from U.S. in 2025. Primary source summary. (Strong relevance.)  
• OilPrice.com (Mar 31, 2025) – EIA data for January: 13.15 mb/d (monthly total ≈407650 thousand barrels), lowest in 15 months. Credible for Jan baseline. (Strong relevance.)  
• CREA Russian exports report – Not directly relevant to U.S. production. (Discarded.)

3. Reference‐class (outside view)  
Use historical March totals 2018–2024 (thousand barrels):  
Mar 2018 ≈334000; Mar 2019 ≈346000; Mar 2020 ≈311000; Mar 2021 ≈343000; Mar 2022 ≈369000; Mar 2023 ≈384000; Mar 2024 ≈409000.  
Linear trend ~+25 000/year (2021–24); seasonal pattern: winter lows in Jan/Feb rebound in Mar (~1.5% above Feb daily avg).

Outside‐view midpoint = Mar 2024 (409 000) + 25 000 ≈434 000, adjusted downward for winter drift to ≈414 000.

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence:  
– IEA & EIA STEO: U.S. at record levels, forecast largest growth in 2025 (+).  
– Jan actual 13.15 mb/d ⇒ 407650 thousand barrels; Feb survey shows production rising into Q1 (+).  
Moderate evidence:  
– Kemp: drillers shifting to gas, may temper oil growth (−).  
– Dallas Fed Q1: production index up (supports rebound +).  
Weak evidence:  
– Russia/asknews geopolitics (irrelevant).

Net effect: modest upside from Feb base but tempered by gas focus.

5. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast date: May 12, 2025 (≈1.5 months after March).  
If we were 0.75 months after (half): no Feb data → wider uncertainty, distribution would widen ±10% edges.  
If we were 3 months after (doubled): EIA would have published March data → point estimate available; distribution would collapse near reported value.

6. Justification & shift from outside view  
Outside view center ≈414 000.  
Inside view adds:  
– EIA STEO, IEA: strong supply growth in 2025 → +5000.  
– Dallas Fed: Q1 rebound from Jan lows → +5000.  
– Kemp: gas pivot slows oil → −3000.  
Net shift ≈+7000 ⇒ new midpoint ≈421 000.  
Combine with seasonal standard deviation (~±8000) yields 90% range roughly [403 000, 439 000], widened for unknowns to [400 000, 440 000].

Probability calibration  
We assign a smooth distribution centered at 421 000 with mild skew to reflect upside bias from strong supply drivers tempered by gas pivot.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Monthly total U.S. crude oil production in March 2025 (thousand barrels).  
2. Outside‐view base rate: Historical March trend gives ≈414 000.  
3. Consistency: Implied median ~421 000; mean ~421 000. Aligns with inside‐view shifts.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Jan 2025 actual 407650 + Feb rebound → baseline ~414 000.  
   • EIA/IEA forecast largest U.S. supply growth → +5000.  
   • Dallas Fed Q1 production index ↑ → +5000.  
   • Gas pivot (Kemp) → −3000.  
5. Blind spot: Sudden hurricane(s) or major pipeline outage in March could sharply cut production (push down).

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. EIA weekly/short-term outlook (via Perplexity and EIA STEO summaries):  
   – Data: Weekly production averaged ~13.45–13.50 mb/d in March 2025. Records a February trough (~13.16 mb/d) and rebound.  
   – Quality: Primary government source, direct measurement; very reliable for base-rate.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Facts on output levels; outlook comments are expert inference.

2. OilPrice.com (March & January 2025 EIA releases):  
   – Data: January output fell to 13.15 mb/d; December revised to 13.45 mb/d.  
   – Quality: Secondary summary of EIA; reliable for trend.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Production figures are factual; commentary on implications is opinion.

3. OilMonster & Macrotrends (historical monthly series):  
   – Data: July 2024 at 409,344 thousand barrels; long-run monthly series.  
   – Quality: Aggregators of EIA data; reliable but dated.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Pure historical facts.

4. Dallas Fed Energy Survey (Q1 2025):  
   – Data: Oil production index rose from +1.1 to +5.6.  
   – Quality: Regional survey of producers; moderate reliability on directional change.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Index movements are factual; future outlook index is opinion.

5. NPR / Center for American Progress / Atlantic Council (policy context):  
   – Data: Executive order to ease drilling permitting; capital discipline limits immediate ramp-up.  
   – Quality: Established journalism and think-tanks; good for causal context.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Policy actions are facts; expert commentary is qualified opinion.

6. Asknews price-and-trade articles (multiple outlets):  
   – Data: Brent/WTI prices, tariff developments, OPEC+ hints.  
   – Quality: Market reporting, varying reliability; useful for price-driven incentive context.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Price quotes are factual; analysts’ price forecasts are opinions.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
• EIA weekly/STE0 data showing a rebound to ~13.50 mb/d in March → monthly total ~418,500 tb.  
• Historical seasonality: March is typically ~2–3% above February.  

Moderate evidence:  
• Dallas Fed survey production index +5.6 suggests modest growth.  
• Policy easing (permitting) could add ~1% but capital discipline and low price limit impact.  

Weak evidence:  
• Oil-price weakness (~$70/bbl) may slightly disincentivize drilling, but the effect on existing wells is small in short run.  
• Geopolitical risks (tariffs, Middle East) could perturb flows but likely muted for US output.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
– Forecast resolution: March 2025 monthly total, to be reported by EIA around April 30–May 2.  
– If timeframe halved (mid-March instead of full month), monthly total uncertain by ±0.5% (weekly swings).  
– If doubled (two months ahead, say May 2025), uncertainty grows to ±2–3% due to seasonal, market and policy shifts.

(d) Justification  
1. Outside view base rate: 13.50 mb/d average in March → 13,500 tbpd × 31 days = 418,500 thousand barrels (historical March monthly totals cluster around 415k–425k).  
2. Seasonal adjustment: +2.5% from February’s ~13.16 mb/d → supports ~418–420 k.  
3. Policy/industry context: Permitting relief might push +1% but low oil prices and capital restraint pull −1%; net effect ~0.  
4. Dallas Fed’s positive Q1 index and record rig productivity sustain plateau rather than sharp rise.  
5. Price incentives: At $70–75/bbl, producers maintain throttle; no major cutbacks or ramp-ups are evidenced.  

Conclusion: Central estimate ~420,000 thousand barrels. Uncertainty ±5% for 90% interval; wider ±10% for 99% interval to cover weather or major shock.

Probability calibration  
Built a full probability distribution around the central 420,000 tb mark. The 40th–60th percentiles bracket ±1.5% of median (417k–423k). The 10th–90th percentiles span ±7% (≈±29k) to capture normal monthly volatility plus minor policy/price effects. The 1st and 99th percentiles allow ±15% shocks for extreme weather, supply outages or sudden policy shifts.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase target: Total US crude oil production in March 2025, in thousand barrels.  
2. Outside view base rate: ~418,500 thousand barrels from 13.50 mb/d average.  
3. Consistency check: Implied median ~420,000; aligned with EIA data and seasonality.  
4. Top evidence:  
   – EIA weekly/STE0 data (~13.50 mb/d).  
   – Seasonal rebound from February (~+2.5%).  
   – Dallas Fed Q1 production index (+5.6).  
   – Policy easing vs price restraint (net ~0).  
   – Historical March totals (415k–425k).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden freeze or hurricane closures in Gulf could dip output by >5% (downward shock).

=== Forecaster 5 ===
Analysis:
1. Source analysis (quality & factual take-aways)
• EIA Monthly series (via Macrotrends, OilMonster) – official survey, last hard data Feb 2025.  High quality, purely factual.  
• EIA Weekly Petroleum Status (not listed above but embedded in news syntheses) – model-based, revised later, useful for March intra-month trajectory.  Moderately reliable.  
• Oilprice 31 Mar 2025 & related press – quotes EIA first-print for January (-305 kbd m/m).  Factual, recent.  
• Dallas Fed Energy Survey Q1 2025 – 12–20 Mar company responses; shows small q/q uptick in production index. Factual, leading sentiment.  
• IEA OMR 13 Mar 2025, STEO 12 Mar 2025 – confirm U.S. at/near record output; no structural shock expected for spring 2025.  High-quality institutional outlooks.  
• JKempEnergy 12 Mar 2025 and other market articles – identify profit shift toward gas drilling but note oil output still around record level; opinion from market analysts (moderate weight).

2. Evidence analysis (importance for March 2025 volume)
Strong
– EIA weekly estimates: 13.2 mbd early Mar rising to ~13.6 mbd last week ⇒ avg ≈ 13.45 mbd.  
– Historical March/December ratio (median 0.96 over 2014-24).  
Moderate  
– January drop (-2.3 %) followed by Feb stabilisation (weekly).  Indicates winter dip largely past.  
– Dallas Fed production index +5.6 suggests incremental q/q growth.  
– WTI ~$70 and no major weather outages; price still ≥ full-cycle breakeven for large Permian players.  
Weak  
– Talk of looming pivot from oil to gas (capital allocation decisions influence late-2025, not March).  
– Macro tariff news; unlikely to change wells already on stream in March.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 3-4 weeks until EIA publishes March final (first print 31 May, revision 30 Jun).  
Half horizon (≈2 wk): negligible new information; forecast band would narrow by ~0.3 %.  
Double horizon (≈8 wk): July revision could move figure ±2 %; uncertainty band widened 0.5-1 %.

4. Outside-view baseline  
Method A – Seasonality: Dec 2024 429700 kbbl × 0.96 ≈ 412000 kbbl.  
Method B – Weekly: 13.45 mbd × 31 d = 418500 kbbl.  
Blend 40 % A + 60 % B = 415900 kbbl.

5. Inside-view adjustments  
+1 % for continued late-March strength and small but positive rig-productivity trend → 420000 kbbl point estimate.  
Uncertainty drivers: sampling error in weekly (+/-1.5 %), future EIA revision (+/-3 %), possible brief freeze-offs (-0.5 %).  Combined 1-σ ≈ 2.5 % ⇒ 90 % CI ≈ ±4 %.

Probability calibration
Median 420000 kbbl.  90 % range 400000-440000 kbbl (slightly skewed high because growth momentum > downside risks).  Distribution rounded to nearest 1000 kbbl.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: total US crude-oil field production, March 2025, thousand barrels.  
2. Base rate: 416000 kbbl (seasonality-weekly blend before news).  
3. Consistency: Implied median 420000 kbbl; mean ~421000 kbbl; coherent with factors cited.  
4. Key evidence: (a) weekly avg 13.45 mbd; (b) historical March/Dec ratio 0.96; (c) Jan dip already reversed; (d) Dallas Fed shows q/q growth; (e) no major outages reported.  
5. Blind-spot: Major upward revision of Jan-Feb survey pointing to methodical undercount → actual March >450000 kbbl (pushes outcome up).

# Analysis:

## Source Analysis:

1. **OilPrice.com (March 31, 2025)** - Reports EIA data showing January 2025 US crude production fell to 13.15 million barrels per day (bpd), the lowest in 15 months. December 2024 production was revised to 13.45 million bpd. Highly relevant, credible source reporting official data.

2. **IEA Oil Market Report (March 13, 2025)** - States the US is at "record production levels" and forecasts it to be the largest source of global supply growth in 2025. Highly credible international agency.

3. **Dallas Fed Energy Survey (Q1 2025)** - Survey conducted March 12-20 shows oil production index rose from 1.1 to 5.6 quarter-on-quarter, indicating expanding production. Credible regional economic data.

4. **EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook via O&G Journal (March 12, 2025)** - Projects rising US production with Brent prices expected to reach $75/barrel by Q3 2025. Authoritative forecast from primary data source.

5. **JKempEnergy (March 12, 2025)** - Analysis by respected energy analyst John Kemp indicating US drillers beginning to shift focus from oil to gas due to price signals. Credible expert opinion.

6. **Recent news articles (May 2025)** - Multiple sources mention Diamondback Energy lowering its 2025 production forecast and US production reaching a "critical point" due to global economic uncertainty and OPEC+ supply increases. These reflect conditions after our target date.

## Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- January 2025 production at 13.15 million bpd (EIA via OilPrice.com)
- US at "record production levels" in March 2025 (IEA)
- Oil production index rose from 1.1 to 5.6 in Q1 2025 (Dallas Fed)
- US crude production expected to average 13.61 million bpd in 2025 (EIA forecast from March)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Beginning shift from oil to gas drilling (JKempEnergy)
- Recovery from January lows consistent with seasonal patterns
- Ongoing momentum in US production despite price pressures

**Weak Evidence:**
- Subsequent production concerns (Diamondback lowering forecast) reflect post-March developments
- General price commentary and global supply-demand dynamics

## Timeframe Analysis:

The forecast is for March 2025, which is approximately 2 months before the current date in the scenario (May 12, 2025). The EIA typically releases monthly crude oil production data with a 2-month lag, so final figures may just be becoming available.

If the timeframe were halved (February 2025), we would rely more heavily on the January data point and early Q1 trends, likely resulting in a lower estimate as recovery from January lows would be partial.

If the timeframe were doubled (May 2025), we would need to account for emerging headwinds like the shift to gas drilling, OPEC+ production increases, and their impact on US production decisions, potentially resulting in a lower estimate.

## Justification:

Starting with January 2025's 13.15 million bpd, evidence strongly suggests March production increased due to:

1. Recovery from winter-related challenges (seasonal pattern)
2. Dallas Fed survey showing rising production throughout Q1
3. IEA's explicit statement about "record production levels" in March

To convert to total monthly production:
- March has 31 days
- If March production was in the 13.5-13.7 million bpd range (reflecting recovery to near or above December's 13.45 million bpd)
- Total would be: 13.5-13.7 million bpd × 31 days = 418,500-424,700 thousand barrels

The "record production levels" statement from IEA suggests March likely exceeded December's 13.45 million bpd, while emerging headwinds kept it from dramatically exceeding the 2025 forecast average of 13.61 million bpd.

# Probability Calibration:

Given the strong evidence for recovery from January lows, the IEA's "record production" statement, and the Dallas Fed's indication of expanding production in Q1, I estimate March 2025 production centered around 421,000 thousand barrels, with a 90% confidence interval of approximately ±5% to account for:

- Potential EIA data revisions
- Uncertainty about the exact pace of recovery from January lows
- Possible unidentified disruptions in March
- Normal month-to-month production variability

I've widened the tails of the distribution to account for greater uncertainty in extreme scenarios, such as major retrospective data revisions or unreported production issues.

# Checklist:
1. Target: US crude oil production in March 2025 in thousand barrels per EIA data
2. Outside view: January 2025 was 407,650 thousand barrels (13.15 million bpd × 31 days), with seasonal recovery expected
3. Consistency: Implied median ≈421,000 thousand barrels aligns with evidence of recovery and "record production" statement
4. Key evidence: January at 13.15 million bpd; IEA's "record levels" statement; Dallas Fed's rising production index; emerging shift to gas drilling
5. Blind spot: Significant retrospective EIA data revisions could push outcome lower if unreported disruptions occurred

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

I'll evaluate each source for reliability, recency, and factual vs. opinion content:

1. **U.S. drillers set to switch focus from oil to gas in 2025** (JKempEnergy.com, March 12, 2025)
   - High quality analysis with specific metrics and industry data
   - Very recent and relevant timeframe
   - Key facts: Gas futures doubled over past year while oil futures fell 17%; gas prices now 37% of oil prices on energy-equivalent basis
   - Expert opinion: US Energy Secretary stated "Gas output is going to grow dramatically while oil is not going to grow meaningfully in the short run"

2. **IEA Oil Market Report – March 2025** (March 13, 2025)
   - High reliability source; IEA is authoritative on energy markets
   - Very recent reporting
   - Key facts: US at "record production levels"; forecast to be largest source of supply growth in 2025; proposed tariffs on Canadian/Mexican oil could disrupt flows
   - Expert projections: IEA forecasts 600 kb/d global surplus in 2025

3. **Dallas Fed Energy Survey, Q1 2025** (March 12-20, 2025)
   - High reliability; Federal Reserve survey with robust methodology (130 firms)
   - Very recent with survey from March 2025
   - Key facts: Oil production index rose from 1.1 to 5.6; industry breakeven price ~$65/barrel; company outlook index fell to -4.9
   - Factual reporting of industry sentiment rather than individual opinions

4. **EIA March STEO via O&G Journal** (March 12, 2025)
   - Medium-high reliability reporting on official EIA forecasts
   - Very recent reporting
   - Key facts: EIA expects global inventories to tighten in Q2, then rebuild as OPEC+ unwinds cuts and non-OPEC output grows
   - Expert projection: Brent price forecast to rise to ~$75/barrel by Q3 2025

5. **OilPrice.com US Oil Output article** (March 31, 2025)
   - Medium-high reliability; reporting specific EIA data
   - Recent and relevant reporting
   - Key facts: January 2025 production fell by 305,000 bpd to 13.15 million bpd; December 2024 production revised down to 13.45 million bpd
   - No significant expert opinions

   - Key facts: Diamondback Energy lowered 2025 production forecast; US production reached "critical point"; Goldman Sachs forecasts lower oil prices
   - Expert opinions: Analysts at Fuji Securities, Global Energy Policy Center, and Dallas Fed regarding price pressures and production outlook

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- January 2025 US production was 13.15 million bpd, down from 13.45 million bpd in December 2024 (EIA data via OilPrice.com)
- Dallas Fed survey showed oil production index rising in Q1 2025 (from 1.1 to 5.6), indicating production growth
- IEA reported US was at "record production levels" and forecast to be largest source of supply growth in 2025
- Permian Basin breakeven price is ~$65/barrel (Dallas Fed), while WTI has been trading below that level (~$57-60/barrel) in recent months
- Multiple sources indicate a shift from oil to gas drilling due to relative price changes

**Moderate evidence:**
- Diamondback Energy lowered its 2025 production forecast due to economic uncertainty and OPEC+ supply increases
- Industry sentiment turned slightly negative (Dallas Fed outlook index at -4.9)
- US-China tariff reduction announcement in May could improve economic conditions
- Trump's budget proposal signaling shift toward fossil fuels (though impacts would be longer-term)

**Weak evidence:**
- Some articles characterize US production as reaching a "critical point" without specific metrics
- Conflicting signals on how quickly producers are responding to price changes
- Uncertain impact of geopolitical tensions on production decisions

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

We are making this forecast on May 12, 2025 for production that occurred in March 2025 – approximately 6 weeks after the period in question. This means:

1. Data for the period has already been collected and reported by the EIA, though it could still be preliminary and subject to revision
2. If the timeframe was halved (forecasting just 3 weeks after March), our confidence would increase slightly as there would be less time for data revisions
3. If the timeframe was doubled (forecasting 12 weeks after March), our confidence would increase as EIA revisions are typically finalized within 2-3 months

## (d) Justification

The most critical piece of information comes from the Perplexity Report (May 2025), which explicitly states: "March 2025 production at 13.50 million barrels per day (approximately 418,500 thousand barrels for the month)."

This represents a significant recovery from January's 13.15 million bpd, which was described as "the lowest monthly level in over a year." The recovery aligns with normal seasonal patterns, where production typically rebounds from winter lows.

The Dallas Fed's rising production index in Q1 2025 supports this recovery. However, there are some constraining factors:
- Oil prices below the $65/barrel breakeven level for many producers
- Industry shift toward gas drilling due to more favorable economics
- Slightly pessimistic industry outlook

Given these factors, I'll use the reported March 2025 figure of 418,500 thousand barrels as my central estimate, with uncertainty reflecting potential data revisions and conflicting market signals.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the central estimate of 418,500 thousand barrels for March 2025, I'll build a probability distribution that accounts for:

1. **Potential data revisions**: EIA data is often revised (December 2024 was revised down by 40,000 bpd)
2. **Uncertainty in reporting accuracy**: The reported figure is recent and potentially preliminary
3. **Conflicting market signals**: Strong production growth indicators versus price pressures and industry caution

The distribution will be slightly right-skewed given:
- March figure already shows recovery from January lows, limiting downside
- Reported figure comes from a recent source (May 2025)
- Most recent EIA revisions have been downward (December was revised down)

My 80% confidence interval (P10-P90) spans approximately ±4.5% from the median, reflecting moderate uncertainty appropriate for recently reported data that might still be revised.

The 98% confidence interval (P1-P99) spans approximately ±7.8%, allowing for more extreme revisions or reporting errors.

# Checklist:
1. Target: US crude oil production in March 2025 in thousand barrels (total monthly production)
2. Outside view: March 2025 production reported at 418,500 thousand barrels (Perplexity Report, May 2025)
3. Consistency: Median = 418,500; distribution slightly right-skewed due to recovery from winter lows
4. Key evidence: (a) March 2025 production reported at 13.50 million bpd (b) January 2025 was 13.15 million bpd (c) Dallas Fed showed rising production index in Q1 (d) Oil prices below many producers' breakeven levels
5. Blind spot: EIA could make larger-than-expected downward revisions due to deteriorating market conditions in late March

• OilPrice.com (Mar 31, 2025) – EIA data for January: 13.15 mb/d (monthly total ≈407650 thousand barrels), lowest in 15 months. Credible for Jan baseline. (Strong relevance.)  
• CREA Russian exports report – Not directly relevant to U.S. production. (Discarded.)

3. Reference‐class (outside view)  
Use historical March totals 2018–2024 (thousand barrels):  
Mar 2018 ≈334000; Mar 2019 ≈346000; Mar 2020 ≈311000; Mar 2021 ≈343000; Mar 2022 ≈369000; Mar 2023 ≈384000; Mar 2024 ≈409000.  
Linear trend ~+25 000/year (2021–24); seasonal pattern: winter lows in Jan/Feb rebound in Mar (~1.5% above Feb daily avg).

Outside‐view midpoint = Mar 2024 (409 000) + 25 000 ≈434 000, adjusted downward for winter drift to ≈414 000.

4. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong evidence:  
– IEA & EIA STEO: U.S. at record levels, forecast largest growth in 2025 (+).  
– Jan actual 13.15 mb/d ⇒ 407650 thousand barrels; Feb survey shows production rising into Q1 (+).  
Moderate evidence:  
– Kemp: drillers shifting to gas, may temper oil growth (−).  
– Dallas Fed Q1: production index up (supports rebound +).  
Weak evidence:  
– Russia/asknews geopolitics (irrelevant).

Net effect: modest upside from Feb base but tempered by gas focus.

5. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast date: May 12, 2025 (≈1.5 months after March).  
If we were 0.75 months after (half): no Feb data → wider uncertainty, distribution would widen ±10% edges.  
If we were 3 months after (doubled): EIA would have published March data → point estimate available; distribution would collapse near reported value.

6. Justification & shift from outside view  
Outside view center ≈414 000.  
Inside view adds:  
– EIA STEO, IEA: strong supply growth in 2025 → +5000.  
– Dallas Fed: Q1 rebound from Jan lows → +5000.  
– Kemp: gas pivot slows oil → −3000.  
Net shift ≈+7000 ⇒ new midpoint ≈421 000.  
Combine with seasonal standard deviation (~±8000) yields 90% range roughly [403 000, 439 000], widened for unknowns to [400 000, 440 000].

Probability calibration  
We assign a smooth distribution centered at 421 000 with mild skew to reflect upside bias from strong supply drivers tempered by gas pivot.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Monthly total U.S. crude oil production in March 2025 (thousand barrels).  
2. Outside‐view base rate: Historical March trend gives ≈414 000.  
3. Consistency: Implied median ~421 000; mean ~421 000. Aligns with inside‐view shifts.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Jan 2025 actual 407650 + Feb rebound → baseline ~414 000.  
   • EIA/IEA forecast largest U.S. supply growth → +5000.  
   • Dallas Fed Q1 production index ↑ → +5000.  
   • Gas pivot (Kemp) → −3000.  
5. Blind spot: Sudden hurricane(s) or major pipeline outage in March could sharply cut production (push down).

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. EIA weekly/short-term outlook (via Perplexity and EIA STEO summaries):  
   – Data: Weekly production averaged ~13.45–13.50 mb/d in March 2025. Records a February trough (~13.16 mb/d) and rebound.  
   – Quality: Primary government source, direct measurement; very reliable for base-rate.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Facts on output levels; outlook comments are expert inference.

2. OilPrice.com (March & January 2025 EIA releases):  
   – Data: January output fell to 13.15 mb/d; December revised to 13.45 mb/d.  
   – Quality: Secondary summary of EIA; reliable for trend.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Production figures are factual; commentary on implications is opinion.

3. OilMonster & Macrotrends (historical monthly series):  
   – Data: July 2024 at 409,344 thousand barrels; long-run monthly series.  
   – Quality: Aggregators of EIA data; reliable but dated.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Pure historical facts.

4. Dallas Fed Energy Survey (Q1 2025):  
   – Data: Oil production index rose from +1.1 to +5.6.  
   – Quality: Regional survey of producers; moderate reliability on directional change.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Index movements are factual; future outlook index is opinion.

5. NPR / Center for American Progress / Atlantic Council (policy context):  
   – Data: Executive order to ease drilling permitting; capital discipline limits immediate ramp-up.  
   – Quality: Established journalism and think-tanks; good for causal context.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Policy actions are facts; expert commentary is qualified opinion.

6. Asknews price-and-trade articles (multiple outlets):  
   – Data: Brent/WTI prices, tariff developments, OPEC+ hints.  
   – Quality: Market reporting, varying reliability; useful for price-driven incentive context.  
   – Opinion vs fact: Price quotes are factual; analysts’ price forecasts are opinions.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
• EIA weekly/STE0 data showing a rebound to ~13.50 mb/d in March → monthly total ~418,500 tb.  
• Historical seasonality: March is typically ~2–3% above February.  

Moderate evidence:  
• Dallas Fed survey production index +5.6 suggests modest growth.  
• Policy easing (permitting) could add ~1% but capital discipline and low price limit impact.  

Weak evidence:  
• Oil-price weakness (~$70/bbl) may slightly disincentivize drilling, but the effect on existing wells is small in short run.  
• Geopolitical risks (tariffs, Middle East) could perturb flows but likely muted for US output.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
– Forecast resolution: March 2025 monthly total, to be reported by EIA around April 30–May 2.  
– If timeframe halved (mid-March instead of full month), monthly total uncertain by ±0.5% (weekly swings).  
– If doubled (two months ahead, say May 2025), uncertainty grows to ±2–3% due to seasonal, market and policy shifts.

(d) Justification  
1. Outside view base rate: 13.50 mb/d average in March → 13,500 tbpd × 31 days = 418,500 thousand barrels (historical March monthly totals cluster around 415k–425k).  
2. Seasonal adjustment: +2.5% from February’s ~13.16 mb/d → supports ~418–420 k.  
3. Policy/industry context: Permitting relief might push +1% but low oil prices and capital restraint pull −1%; net effect ~0.  
4. Dallas Fed’s positive Q1 index and record rig productivity sustain plateau rather than sharp rise.  
5. Price incentives: At $70–75/bbl, producers maintain throttle; no major cutbacks or ramp-ups are evidenced.  

Conclusion: Central estimate ~420,000 thousand barrels. Uncertainty ±5% for 90% interval; wider ±10% for 99% interval to cover weather or major shock.

Probability calibration  
Built a full probability distribution around the central 420,000 tb mark. The 40th–60th percentiles bracket ±1.5% of median (417k–423k). The 10th–90th percentiles span ±7% (≈±29k) to capture normal monthly volatility plus minor policy/price effects. The 1st and 99th percentiles allow ±15% shocks for extreme weather, supply outages or sudden policy shifts.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase target: Total US crude oil production in March 2025, in thousand barrels.  
2. Outside view base rate: ~418,500 thousand barrels from 13.50 mb/d average.  
3. Consistency check: Implied median ~420,000; aligned with EIA data and seasonality.  
4. Top evidence:  
   – EIA weekly/STE0 data (~13.50 mb/d).  
   – Seasonal rebound from February (~+2.5%).  
   – Dallas Fed Q1 production index (+5.6).  
   – Policy easing vs price restraint (net ~0).  
   – Historical March totals (415k–425k).  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden freeze or hurricane closures in Gulf could dip output by >5% (downward shock).

=== Forecaster 5 ===
Analysis:
1. Source analysis (quality & factual take-aways)
• EIA Monthly series (via Macrotrends, OilMonster) – official survey, last hard data Feb 2025.  High quality, purely factual.  
• EIA Weekly Petroleum Status (not listed above but embedded in news syntheses) – model-based, revised later, useful for March intra-month trajectory.  Moderately reliable.  
• Oilprice 31 Mar 2025 & related press – quotes EIA first-print for January (-305 kbd m/m).  Factual, recent.  
• Dallas Fed Energy Survey Q1 2025 – 12–20 Mar company responses; shows small q/q uptick in production index. Factual, leading sentiment.  
• IEA OMR 13 Mar 2025, STEO 12 Mar 2025 – confirm U.S. at/near record output; no structural shock expected for spring 2025.  High-quality institutional outlooks.  
• JKempEnergy 12 Mar 2025 and other market articles – identify profit shift toward gas drilling but note oil output still around record level; opinion from market analysts (moderate weight).

2. Evidence analysis (importance for March 2025 volume)
Strong
– EIA weekly estimates: 13.2 mbd early Mar rising to ~13.6 mbd last week ⇒ avg ≈ 13.45 mbd.  
– Historical March/December ratio (median 0.96 over 2014-24).  
Moderate  
– January drop (-2.3 %) followed by Feb stabilisation (weekly).  Indicates winter dip largely past.  
– Dallas Fed production index +5.6 suggests incremental q/q growth.  
– WTI ~$70 and no major weather outages; price still ≥ full-cycle breakeven for large Permian players.  
Weak  
– Talk of looming pivot from oil to gas (capital allocation decisions influence late-2025, not March).  
– Macro tariff news; unlikely to change wells already on stream in March.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 3-4 weeks until EIA publishes March final (first print 31 May, revision 30 Jun).  
Half horizon (≈2 wk): negligible new information; forecast band would narrow by ~0.3 %.  
Double horizon (≈8 wk): July revision could move figure ±2 %; uncertainty band widened 0.5-1 %.

4. Outside-view baseline  
Method A – Seasonality: Dec 2024 429700 kbbl × 0.96 ≈ 412000 kbbl.  
Method B – Weekly: 13.45 mbd × 31 d = 418500 kbbl.  
Blend 40 % A + 60 % B = 415900 kbbl.

5. Inside-view adjustments  
+1 % for continued late-March strength and small but positive rig-productivity trend → 420000 kbbl point estimate.  
Uncertainty drivers: sampling error in weekly (+/-1.5 %), future EIA revision (+/-3 %), possible brief freeze-offs (-0.5 %).  Combined 1-σ ≈ 2.5 % ⇒ 90 % CI ≈ ±4 %.

Probability calibration
Median 420000 kbbl.  90 % range 400000-440000 kbbl (slightly skewed high because growth momentum > downside risks).  Distribution rounded to nearest 1000 kbbl.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: total US crude-oil field production, March 2025, thousand barrels.  
2. Base rate: 416000 kbbl (seasonality-weekly blend before news).  
3. Consistency: Implied median 420000 kbbl; mean ~421000 kbbl; coherent with factors cited.  
4. Key evidence: (a) weekly avg 13.45 mbd; (b) historical March/Dec ratio 0.96; (c) Jan dip already reversed; (d) Dallas Fed shows q/q growth; (e) no major outages reported.  
5. Blind-spot: Major upward revision of Jan-Feb survey pointing to methodical undercount → actual March >450000 kbbl (pushes outcome up).
