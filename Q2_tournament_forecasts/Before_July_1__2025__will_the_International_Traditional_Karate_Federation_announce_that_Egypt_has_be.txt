Analysis:
We need an outside‐view of how the International Traditional Karate Federation has run its World‐Championship host‐selection process in the past: Which countries have hosted, when those hosts were announced relative to the competition year, how bids are made, and any pattern or rotation. We also need to know whether Egypt has formally bid, whether ITKF leadership has visited Egypt, and what public statements have been made. From that baseline we can judge how likely an announcement by July 1, 2025 is. Our queries therefore seek (1) the historical host‐announcement timeline, (2) any press on Egypt’s 2026 bid, and (3) a detailed synthesis.

Analysis:
The question hinges on whether the ITKF makes a formal announcement naming Egypt as the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship host by July 1, 2025. As of early May 2025, no such announcement has been made publicly. To gauge the inside view, we need the most recent updates on:
- ITKF’s bidding and host-selection timeline (e.g., scheduled board meetings or voting dates).
- Any press releases or news interviews from ITKF leadership about the hosting decision.
- Statements from Egypt’s sports ministry or national karate federation confirming bid progress.
- Reports of competing bids or shortlisted candidate countries.

These data will let us adjust from our baseline (historically, announcements occur ~12–18 months before the event) to an informed inside-view probability.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**1. Facebook post (ITKF INDIA - NKF Championship 2024)**
- Contains details about a national event in India scheduled for December 2024
- Limited relevance to our forecasting question about Egypt hosting the 2026 World Championship
- Reliable for the specific event mentioned but offers little insight into international hosting decisions

**2. ITKF Events Page**
- Official information from the ITKF website about upcoming 2024 championships
- High reliability as an official source for confirmed events
- Shows Peru hosting the XXI World Traditional Karate Championship (November 2024)
- No mention of Egypt or 2026 plans

**3. ITKF Homepage**
- Official ITKF website content showing 2025 calendar and organizational updates
- Highly reliable for confirmed federation information
- Mentions the 22nd World Traditional Karate-Do Championship scheduled for 2025
- Notable absence of any reference to Egypt or 2026 hosting plans

**4. Google Search for "Egypt ITKF 2026 host bid news"**
- No results returned - significant negative evidence
- Suggests no public information exists about Egypt's potential 2026 World Championship bid

**5. Perplexity Report on ITKF World Championship hosting**
- Comprehensive timeline of past host selections (2012-2024)
- Documents Egypt previously hosted the 17th Championship in 2014
- Details standard bidding procedures requiring national government approval and ITKF General Meeting vote
- States: "No documented evidence in the provided sources indicates Egypt submitted a bid for the 2026 ITKF World Championship"
- Notes hosts are typically announced 2-3 years in advance
- High relevance and appears well-sourced

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Most appropriate reference classes:

**1. Previous ITKF World Championship host selections (Primary)**
- Directly relevant to the question's subject matter
- Shows consistent patterns in announcement timing (2-3 years before event)
- Indicates formal bidding processes through official channels
- Information from 2012-2024 provides solid comparative basis

**2. Egypt's history with ITKF events (Secondary)**
- Egypt successfully hosted in 2014, demonstrating capability and precedent
- Limited to a single data point but shows Egypt's previous interest and capacity

**3. General international sporting event bidding processes**
- Too broad to be particularly useful for this specific federation
- Different sports have widely varying timelines and procedures

The first reference class is most suitable due to its direct relevance and multiple data points.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Today is May 8, 2025, leaving approximately 53 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline.

Based on the Perplexity report:
- ITKF typically announces hosts 2-3 years in advance
- For example, Portugal's hosting of the 2024 championship was announced in 2022
- Following this pattern, the 2026 host would normally have been announced in 2023-2024
- We are now in May 2025, which is significantly later than the typical announcement window

This timing analysis suggests we are well past the normal announcement period for a 2026 event.

## (d) Justification

Several factors significantly reduce the likelihood of Egypt being announced as the 2026 host in the next 53 days:

1. **Absence of evidence**: No documentation exists showing Egypt has submitted a bid for 2026, despite detailed records of previous bids.

2. **Late timeline**: We're approximately 19 months from 2026, while hosts are typically announced 24-36 months in advance. This suggests either the host has already been selected (but not announced) or the process is unusually delayed.

3. **No media coverage**: The absence of any search results regarding Egypt's bid suggests a lack of public process or announcement preparation.

4. **No mention in official channels**: The ITKF has announced events for 2024 and 2025 with no reference to 2026 plans or Egypt's involvement.

Factors slightly increasing the possibility:

1. **Previous successful hosting**: Egypt did host in 2014, demonstrating capability and establishing precedent.

2. **Possibility of delayed process**: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many sporting event timelines; the ITKF's processes may still be recovering.

3. **Limited information transparency**: The ITKF may not publicize all aspects of its host selection process until formal announcements.

## Outside view calibration:

The historical pattern of ITKF host announcements occurring 2-3 years before the event strongly suggests the 2026 host would typically have been determined by now (May 2025). The complete absence of any public information about an Egyptian bid is particularly telling, as these bids typically involve government approval and public documentation.

I must account for limited information availability about ITKF's internal processes. While Egypt successfully hosted in 2014, a single previous hosting 12 years earlier doesn't substantially increase probability without evidence of a current bid.

The fact that we're within 53 days of the resolution deadline, yet no public documents, news reports, or ITKF communications mention Egypt's involvement in 2026 bidding is the strongest negative signal. Host selections involve complex logistics, government guarantees, and venue preparations that typically generate documentation.

Balancing these factors, I estimate that the probability is very low - likely between 10-15%.

## Outside View Prediction:
12%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **Facebook Post Summary (ITKF INDIA - NKF seminar)**:
   - Coverage of a December 2024 karate championship seminar in India
   - Limited relevance to our question; contains no information about Egypt or 2026 host selection
   - Source quality: Low relevance for our specific forecasting question

2. **ITKF Events Page**:
   - Official ITKF information listing current events
   - Shows championships scheduled for 2024 (Lima, Peru and Buenos Aires, Argentina)
   - No mention of 2026 host selection process or Egypt
   - Source quality: High credibility but no relevant information for our question

3. **ITKF Homepage**:
   - Official ITKF content outlining 2025 calendar and organizational developments
   - Mentions 28 events across four continents for 2025
   - No reference to 2026 championship or Egypt
   - Source quality: High credibility but lacks information specific to our question

4. **Perplexity Report on ITKF Host Selections**:
   - Comprehensive timeline of past ITKF World Championships (2012-2024)
   - Documents bidding procedures and selection processes
   - Explicitly states: "No documented evidence in the provided sources indicates Egypt submitted a bid for the 2026 ITKF World Championship"
   - Notes Egypt previously hosted in 2014
   - Indicates hosts are typically announced 2-3 years in advance
   - Source quality: High detail and directly relevant to our question

## (b) Reference Class Analysis:

Several potential reference classes can be considered:

1. **Historical hosting patterns**: The Perplexity report identifies hosts as Poland (2012), Egypt (2014), Slovenia (2022), and Portugal (2024). Egypt has hosted before, establishing precedent.

2. **Host announcement timeline**: The report indicates hosts are "typically announced 2-3 years in advance" with Portugal's 2024 hosting announced in 2022.

3. **Bidding requirements**: ITKF requires formal bids from member organizations, approved by national governments and voted on at the ITKF General Meeting.

The most appropriate reference class is the host announcement timeline, as it directly relates to our question about an announcement before July 1, 2025.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

Today is May 8, 2025, leaving approximately 53 days until our deadline of July 1, 2025.

Based on the established pattern of announcing hosts 2-3 years in advance, we would expect the 2026 championship host to have been announced between 2023-2024. The fact that no announcement is reflected in any of our sources by May 2025 suggests either:
- A delay in the normal selection timeline
- The selection has occurred but isn't captured in our sources
- The selection process is still ongoing

## (d) Justification:

Several factors suggest a low probability that Egypt will be announced as the 2026 host before July 1, 2025:

1. **No evidence of an Egyptian bid**: The Perplexity report explicitly states there's no documented evidence of Egypt submitting a bid for 2026. Without a bid, selection is impossible.

2. **Timeline inconsistency**: Following the standard 2-3 year announcement pattern, the 2026 host should have been announced by now. The absence of any mention in current ITKF materials suggests either the decision is delayed or has gone to another country.

3. **Formal process requirements**: Host selection requires ITKF General Meeting approval, suggesting there would be public records if Egypt had been selected.

4. **Recent hosting history**: Egypt hosted in 2014, relatively recently in the organization's history. While repeat hosting is possible, it may be less likely within a decade.

5. **Limited remaining timeframe**: With only 53 days until our deadline, the window for an announcement is narrow, especially considering the formal procedures involved.

## Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I must consider several key points:

1. The most significant factor is the explicit statement that there's no evidence Egypt has submitted a bid for 2026, which is a necessary precondition for selection.

2. The timing pattern indicates that announcements typically occur 2-3 years before the event. We're now less than 1.5 years from 2026, suggesting the announcement would normally have already happened.

3. The short timeframe remaining (53 days) further reduces the likelihood of an announcement about Egypt.

4. The sources may be incomplete - there could be information about Egypt's bid or selection not captured in the provided materials.

Given the absence of evidence for Egypt's bid (a necessary precondition) and the timeline inconsistency, the probability appears very low - likely single digits.

     – Aggregates historical host data (Poland 2012, Egypt 2014, Slovenia 2022, Portugal 2024) and ITKF rules. Moderately reliable but cross‐checked plausibly against known ITKF patterns.  
     – No mention of any 2026 bidding process or Egypt’s renewed bid; suggests no public push from Egypt or ITKF.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
   Possible reference classes:  
   a. ITKF World Championship host announcements (n=4: 2012, 2014, 2022, 2024)  
   b. Host‐city selection timelines in analogous martial‐arts federations (WKF, WTKF, IKU)  
   c. Major world‐sport events (FIFA, Olympic) host‐city announcement lead times  
   Suitability: (a) is the tightest historical parallel. ITKF has announced hosts roughly 2 years before their event and never within 1 year. The analogous federations also tend to announce at least 18–24 months ahead for planning.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Today: May 8, 2025; cutoff: July 1, 2025 → ~54 days remaining.  
   • Past pattern:  
     – 2014 host (Egypt) announced ~2012 → ~2 years ahead  
     – 2024 host (Portugal) announced in 2022 → ~2 years ahead  
     – 2022 host (Slovenia) likewise earlier, not last-minute  
   • No precedent for selecting or announcing the ITKF World Championship host less than one year before the event.  

4. Justification for outside view  
   • No evidence (no bids published, no press releases) that Egypt has formally bid for 2026, nor that ITKF is taking late bids.  
   • ITKF’s own calendar omits any reference to the 2026 host decision, even as it publicizes 2025 events.  
   • Reference‐class base rate: 0 of 4 past cycles saw a host selected within a year of the event; announcements consistently occur ~24 ± 6 months ahead.  
   • Institutional inertia and planning needs make a sub-one-year lead time highly unlikely—teams, federations, travel logistics all require longer lead.  
   • While schedules can slip, the absence of any public indicator by May 2025 argues against a surprise announcement before July 1.  

Outside view calibration:

Base‐rate for “host announced < 1 year before event” in this federation: 0/4 → effectively near zero, but allow a small tail for organizational idiosyncrasy or delayed disclosure.  
Broaden with analogous sports federations: virtually none announce under 12 months out, but occasional late reveals happen—give that a 5–15% credence.  
Leaning to the lower end given the total absence of preparatory signals.  

Outside View Prediction:

There is a 10% chance that, by July 1, 2025, ITKF will announce Egypt as host of the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. Facebook post on “ITKF INDIA – NKF National Karate Championship 2024 seminar”  
      • Content: Announced a December 2024 seminar in New Delhi, speaker lineup, seminar topics and logistics.  
      • Quality: Primary but informal (social‐media) source. Factual about a single event; no relevance to 2026 host selection.  
      • Fact vs. opinion: All factual descriptions of that seminar; contains no host‐selection information.  
   b. ITKF “Events” page (Peru and Argentina events)  
      • Content: Lists two late-2024 championships (Lima and Buenos Aires), under ITKF partnerships.  
      • Quality: Official federation page; authoritative on scheduled events but does not cover 2026.  
      • Fact vs. opinion: Purely factual schedule listings.  
   c. ITKF global homepage summary  
      • Content: 2025 calendar items, strategic‐planning news, technological initiatives, no mention of Egypt or 2026 host.  
      • Quality: Authoritative; represents federation’s public communications.  
      • Fact vs. opinion: Mostly factual reporting of organizational developments; no relevant host‐selection detail.  
   d. “Egypt ITKF 2026 host bid news” Google query  
      • Content: No results, implying no public news or press releases on an Egyptian bid.  
      • Quality: Negative evidence but reliable as a quick check; absence of coverage.  
   e. Perplexity report on host-selection timeline (2012–present)  
      • Content: Summarizes host cities and announcement patterns for 2014, 2012, 2022, 2024; no 2026 bid by Egypt.  
      • Quality: AI–generated summary of known history; cites plausible dates but should be treated cautiously.  
      • Fact vs. opinion: Presents factual claims (e.g. dates, locations) mixed with inferred absence of Egypt’s 2026 bid.  

2. Reference class analysis  
   Possible reference classes:  
     • ITKF World Championship host announcements (2012–2024): announcements typically occur ~2 years before the event.  
     • Bidding cycles in comparable martial-arts federations (WKF, WTKF) for world-championship hosts: selection 1–2 years out.  
     • Frequency of announcements in the 12 months preceding host year among international federations.  
   Suitability: The ITKF-specific class (2012–2024 host announcements) is the most directly relevant. It shows a pattern of naming hosts approximately 24–30 months in advance (2014 chosen around late 2012; 2024 chosen in 2022).  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   • Today: May 8, 2025.  
   • Deadline for question: July 1, 2025 (≈8 weeks away).  
   • Historical lead time: All past ITKF hosts were announced at least 12 months prior to the championship (often closer to 24 months), suggesting that if the pattern holds, the 2026 host should have been announced by mid-2024.  

4. Justification for outside view prediction  
   • No public or federation communications indicate that Egypt has even bid, much less won selection.  
   • Absence of any mention on official ITKF channels and in global karate media by May 2025 strongly implies no decision in favor of Egypt.  
   • Historical pattern: host cities are typically selected well over a year before the event. Missing that window makes a July 1, 2025 announcement unusual.  
   • Federation strategic priorities appear focused on executing 2025 events and internal restructuring, with no signals of imminent 2026-host news.  

Outside view calibration:  
Based on the reference class of past ITKF host‐selection lead times (100% of recent hosts announced ≥12 months in advance) and the complete lack of public signals for Egypt’s selection, the baseline probability for a “Yes” outcome by July 1, 2025 is extremely low. Allowing for a small tail risk—late announcements or private decisions not yet public—the outside view probability is approximately 5%.

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• ITKF global homepage (Jan-2025 scrape). Purely factual institutional communication: 2025 calendar shows 28 events but no 2026 host; no mention of Egypt. Good quality for “what ITKF has officially said,” but absence-of-evidence is not evidence-of-absence.  
• ITKF “Events” page. Lists 2024 flagship championships (Lima, Peru and Buenos Aires, Argentina). Again, direct primary source; gives a sense of lead-time (events 10-18 months away are already posted).  
• Facebook post about an Indian seminar (Dec-2024). Irrelevant to 2026 host selection; low value for forecasting question.  
• Perplexity “timeline” report. Secondary synthesis drawing on scattered press releases and bulletins (2012 Poland, 2014 Egypt, 2022 Slovenia, 2024 Portugal). Factual items (year, host city, dates) are verifiable; opinions (e.g., “technological innovations,” “institutional consolidation”) can be ignored. Quality: useful for historical host pattern, but sample size is tiny (n = 4) and some dates may be approximate.  

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. ITKF World Traditional Karate Championships (only four well-documented cycle data points).  
2. Other small/medium martial-arts federations’ world championships (WTKF, IKU, WKF traditional divisions) with similar budgets and lead-times.  
3. All amateur world championships run by federations with <100 member countries.  

Class 1 is the most directly relevant despite small n; it tells us:  
• Host is usually announced 18-36 months in advance.  
• Since 2012 the hosts were Poland → Egypt → Slovenia → Portugal (all different continents, none repeated).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 8 May 2025.  
• Question deadline: 1 July 2025 (≈ 54 days).  
• Event date: sometime in 2026 (≈ 16-20 months away).  
Historical pattern says the 2026 host “should” already have been made public; the fact that it has not yet been announced lowers the baseline probability of any announcement in the next 54 days, though a late announcement is still plausible for a mid-tier federation.  

(d) Justification (outside view)  
1. Base-rate for Egypt hosting: 1 out of the last 4 championships (25%), but that’s inflated by sparse data; if we assume roughly 15 plausibly capable member countries, an uninformative base-rate would be ~7%.  
2. Base-rate for a late (<18-month) announcement: looking at ITKF/WTKF/Iku data, perhaps 30-40% of championships are announced this late; call it 35%.  
3. Combine: 7% (chance host = Egypt) × 35% (chance announcement before 1 July 2025) ≈ 2.5%.  
4. Upward adjustments: Egypt is historically a top-3 medal country and has proven hosting capacity (Cairo 2014) → +3 percentage-points.  
5. Downward adjustments: The federation usually rotates continents; 2014 Africa, 2024 Europe, 2022 Europe; rotation would favour Americas or Asia rather than Africa → −1 percentage-point.  

Net outside-view probability ≈ 4%–5%; round to the nearest 1 percent gives 5%.  

Outside view calibration:
Baseline (host = any given plausible country) ~7%.  
Late-announcement likelihood ~35%.  
Multiplicative baseline ≈2½%.  
Qualitative adjustments (+3, −1) lift it to ~5%.  
No expert or market odds available to anchor further. 5% corresponds to 19:1 odds against, which feels proportionate to a “possible but quite unlikely” scenario given the timing.

Outside View Prediction:

   - Official FISU announcement dated February 10, 2025
   - High reliability as an official statement
   - Factual information: Egypt (Sharm El-Sheikh) will host the 2026 FISU Finswimming Championship
   - No mention of karate or ITKF
   - Shows Egypt's current capability to secure international sporting events

5. **Outside view prediction**
   - Comprehensive analysis of ITKF hosting patterns and Egypt's history
   - Contemporary (May 2025) and directly relevant
   - Factual information: ITKF typically announces 2-3 years in advance; Egypt hosted in 2014; no documented evidence of a 2026 bid

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **No public bid documentation exists** - Multiple searches show no evidence of Egypt submitting a bid for 2026, despite ITKF's typically transparent processes involving government approvals and federation votes.
- **Timeline discrepancy** - Historical pattern shows ITKF announces hosts 24-36 months in advance (2023-2024 for a 2026 event), yet we're in May 2025 with no announcement.
- **Absence from official ITKF communications** - The federation has announced events for 2024-2025 with no mention of 2026 plans or Egypt's involvement.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Egypt's competitive success** - First place at the 2024 World Championship demonstrates Egypt's current prominence in traditional karate.
- **Previous hosting experience** - Egypt successfully hosted the 17th Championship in 2014, proving capability.
- **Concurrent international event hosting** - Egypt secured the 2026 FISU Finswimming Championship, showing government support for hosting international sporting events.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Potential COVID disruptions** - The pandemic may have delayed ITKF's normal processes, though without specific evidence.
- **Limited transparency** - ITKF may not publicize all aspects of its selection process, though this contradicts normal federation practices.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Today is May 8, 2025, with 53 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline.

If this timeframe were halved (26-27 days), my prediction would be even more confident in a negative outcome. Such short notice for announcing a major international championship host would be extremely unusual and logistically problematic.

If doubled (106 days), my prediction would shift only marginally. While providing more time, we would still be well outside the typical 2-3 year announcement window, and the complete lack of public information about an Egyptian bid would remain highly significant.

The timeframe is critical because as we approach July 1 without any indication of Egypt's candidacy, the probability diminishes substantially. International championship preparations require extensive lead time for logistics, venue readiness, and promotional activities.

## (d) Justification

The outside view base rate of 12% already accounts for the historical patterns in ITKF host selections and Egypt's previous hosting experience. Several current factors further reduce this probability:

1. **Complete absence of documentation** - In international sport federation procedures, bid submissions generate multiple documentation points (expressions of interest, formal submissions, site inspections). The total absence of any such documentation for Egypt is compelling negative evidence.

2. **Severe timeline deviation** - We're 5-17 months behind ITKF's normal announcement schedule. This represents a significant departure from established practices that would typically require extraordinary circumstances to justify.

3. **No parallel preparation signals** - Major championships require venue preparations, budget allocations, and organizational groundwork, which typically generate media coverage and official communications. The absence of any such signals from Egypt is telling.

Factors that slightly mitigate these negative signals:

1. **Egypt's current sporting prominence** - Winning the 2024 World Championship puts Egypt in a strong position within the ITKF community.

2. **Demonstrated international event hosting capacity** - Egypt's successful bid for the 2026 FISU Finswimming Championship shows current government willingness to support international sporting events.

However, these positive factors are insufficient to overcome the procedural and timeline evidence. While Egypt has the credentials to be a credible host, the lack of any documented bid process strongly suggests they are not actively pursuing the 2026 championship, or if they were, the bid was unsuccessful.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 12%, I need to adjust based on the current evidence.

The strongest negative signals are:
- Complete absence of any bid documentation or news (strong evidence)
- Significant deviation from normal announcement timeline (strong evidence)
- No preparation signals from Egyptian karate authorities (moderate evidence)

These factors collectively suggest a downward adjustment is warranted. The procedural aspects of international sport event bidding are highly structured, and the absence of evidence across multiple potential documentation points is particularly compelling.

The positive signals (Egypt's competitive success and other 2026 hosting activities) demonstrate capability but not intent for this specific championship.

Considering the remaining timeframe (53 days) and the weight of evidence, I adjust the probability downward to 10%. This reflects that while not impossible, an announcement of Egypt as the 2026 host would require extraordinary circumstances that contradict established ITKF patterns.

# Checklist:

1. Will the ITKF announce before July 1, 2025 that Egypt will host their 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?

2. Outside view base rate: 12%

3. In 10 out of 100 similar scenarios, Egypt would be announced as the 2026 ITKF World Championship host before July 1, 2025.

4. Key evidence: No bid documentation exists despite ITKF's transparent processes; currently 5-17 months behind normal announcement schedule; Egypt won 2024 Championship showing prominence; Egypt is hosting other 2026 international events.

5. Blind spot: A confidential selection process may have already chosen Egypt with announcement strategically delayed until June 2025.

6. Status quo is no announcement, which remains highly likely given timeframe and documentation gaps.

Predicted Probability: 10.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:
1. **ITKF World Championship Article (itkf.global)** - Highly authoritative source from the official ITKF website about the 2024 Championship in Portugal (October 2024). Factually reports Egypt winning the 2024 team championship. Contains official quotes from ITKF Chairman and other officials about event management and competition quality.

2. **FISU Executive Committee Article (February 10, 2025)** - Recent reliable information about the International University Sports Federation announcing host cities for 2026 championships, including Egypt hosting finswimming in Sharm El-Sheikh. Demonstrates Egypt's active engagement in bidding for international sporting events.

3. **Palestine Chronicle Archive** - Unrelated to karate or sports; irrelevant to our question.

4. **Facebook ITKF Africa** - Only cookie consent information captured; no usable content for analysis.

5. **Outside View Analysis** - Provides historical context on ITKF host selection patterns (2012-2024) with Poland, Egypt (2014), Slovenia, and Portugal hosting previous championships.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong evidence:**
- ITKF's consistent pattern of announcing hosts approximately 2 years before events (structural factor)
- No public indication of Egypt's bid for 2026 by May 2025 despite being less than 8 months from 2026 (institutional factor)
- No mention of 2026 host selection on ITKF's official communications or calendar (institutional factor)

**Moderate evidence:**
- Egypt finished 1st in team standings at the 2024 Championship (demonstrates competitive prominence)
- Egypt successfully secured a 2026 FISU Championship for finswimming (shows current capability in hosting international sports events)
- Egypt has previously hosted the ITKF World Championship in 2014 (historical precedent)

**Weak evidence:**
- The complete absence of any public discussion about 2026 hosting selections in recent ITKF communications

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current timeframe: May 8, 2025 to July 1, 2025 (~54 days)
- If the timeframe were halved (~27 days), the probability would decrease further, as it would leave even less time for an unexpected announcement
- If the timeframe were doubled (~108 days), the probability might increase slightly but would still be low given ITKF's typical 2-year lead time for host announcements
- We are now less than 8 months from 2026, significantly outside the normal 24±6 month announcement window

## (d) Justification:

The outside view gave us a 10% probability based primarily on ITKF's historical announcement patterns. Current evidence provides some factors that could slightly adjust this probability:

**Factors potentially increasing probability:**
1. Egypt's current strength in traditional karate (1st place in 2024 Championship)
2. Egypt has previously hosted successfully (2014) and thus has infrastructure experience
3. Egypt is actively securing other international sporting events (FISU 2026)
4. There could be undisclosed negotiations or an emergency fast-track process

**Factors strongly decreasing probability:**
1. Complete absence of public information about an Egyptian bid by May 2025
2. The extremely short timeframe remaining (54 days)
3. ITKF's consistent pattern of announcing hosts ~2 years in advance (never <1 year)
4. No mention of 2026 host selection process in any recent ITKF communications

The structural and timing factors substantially outweigh the factors favoring Egypt as a potential host. While Egypt has demonstrated capacity and prominence in the sport, the institutional pattern of ITKF making these announcements well in advance (typically 2 years) is extremely consistent, and we've seen no deviation from this pattern.

# Probability calibration

The outside view gave us a 10% baseline probability. After weighing the evidence:

- The historical timing pattern is extremely strong evidence against an announcement within our timeframe
- Egypt's prominence in the sport and previous hosting experience are moderate factors in favor
- Egypt's demonstrated capacity for hosting international events in 2026 (FISU) provides a slight boost
- The complete absence of any preparatory signals by May 2025 strongly suggests no announcement is imminent

I'm adjusting the probability only slightly upward from the outside view, from 10% to 12%. This small increase acknowledges Egypt's strong position while still recognizing the overwhelming timing constraints and ITKF's established processes.

# Checklist:
1. Resolution criteria: Will ITKF announce before July 1, 2025 that Egypt will host the 2026 World Championship?
2. Base rate: 10% based on historical ITKF announcement patterns
3. Consistency: In 12 out of 100 similar scenarios, ITKF would announce Egypt as 2026 host before July 1
4. Key evidence: ITKF normally announces hosts ~2 years ahead; Egypt won 2024 Championship; No public bid visible with <8 months to 2026; Only 54 days remain until resolution
5. Blind spot: ITKF might face an emergency where Egypt is the only capable rapid-deployment option
6. Status quo: No host announced yet; short timeframe favors continued non-announcement

Predicted Probability: 12.0%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Perplexity report on ITKF host selections (high credibility; late April–May 2025).  Documents past hosts (2012–2024), bidding procedures, and notes no evidence Egypt submitted a bid for 2026.  
- ITKF official events page (high credibility; accessed early May 2025).  Lists events through 2025; no mention of 2026 host.  
- ITKF news on 22nd World Championship in Portugal (Gilberto Gaertner quotes; Oct 2024).  Describes success of the recent event, but no hint on 2026 bidding.  
- FISU article on 2026 World University Championships hosts (moderate relevance; Feb 2025).  Illustrates timing and formal awarding processes for another sports federation, but unrelated to ITKF.  
- Palestine Chronicle “Solidarity” archive & ITKF Africa Facebook (low relevance; various dates).  No information about 2026 ITKF host selection.

2. Evidence analysis  
- Strong evidence:  
  • Historical pattern—ITKF announces hosts 2–3 years ahead (hosts for 2024 were selected in 2022).  
  • No documented Egyptian bid—as reported by Perplexity. A formal bid is a necessary precondition.  
  • Institutional requirement—selection needs a national bid plus ITKF General Assembly approval, which is normally publicized.  
- Moderate evidence:  
  • Egypt hosted in 2014—shows precedent but long interval (12 years) reduces urgency/momentum.  
- Weak evidence:  
  • Analogy to FISU timelines—interesting but federations differ.

3. Timeframe analysis  
- There are 53 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline.  
- Halved timeframe (≈26 days) would further reduce chances, as formal processes take weeks.  
- Doubled timeframe (≈106 days) might modestly increase likelihood if a delayed announcement emerges, but would still require a rapid bid, vote and PR cycle.

4. Justification  
Our outside-view base-rate (historical pattern) suggests the 2026 ITKF host would have been announced by mid-2024. The absence of any public bid or announcement for Egypt by May 2025, combined with the formal requirements (bid submission, government sign-off, ITKF vote), makes a last-minute announcement unlikely. The few remaining days provide too short a runway for the necessary procedural steps and global publicity. Thus, we shift our base rate (≈8%) downward to reflect these strong disconfirming signals.

Probability calibration  
I started with an out-of-sample baseline of 8% (derived from historical announcement timing and bidding prevalence). The strong evidence of no bid and no announcement, plus procedural lead-time constraints, warrants a moderate downward adjustment. I settle on a 5% estimate for Egypt being named host before July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will ITKF announce Egypt as 2026 host by July 1 2025?  
2. Base rate: Historically, hosts are named ~2–3 years ahead (so normally announced by 2023–24).  
3. Consistency: 5 out of 100 times, a country without a documented bid and with procedural timeline constraints gets announced last-minute.  
4. Key evidence:  
   - No bid documented (strong)  
   - Typical 2–3 years lead time (strong)  
   - Formal approval process would be public (strong)  
   - 53 days left (moderate)  
5. Blind spot: ITKF could have secret negotiated a deal with Egypt and simply hasn’t publicized interim steps—if true, probability could jump.  
6. Status quo: No public info by May 2025 suggests “No announcement” is the default.

   - FISU 2026 host awards (Feb ’25): Lists Egypt hosting FISU finswimming, but unrelated federation. Indicates Egypt’s sports hosting interest but not in karate.

2. Evidence analysis  
   - Historical pattern: All past ITKF World Championship hosts announced ≥12 months before event (Strong).  
   - No public signals of an Egyptian bid or selection by May ’25 (Moderate).  
   - ITKF communications focus on internal events and tech upgrades, not on pending host announcements (Moderate).  
   - Egypt’s broader sports hosting (e.g. FISU) suggests capacity but no link to ITKF decision (Weak).

3. Timeframe analysis  
   - Today: May 8, 2025. Resolution deadline: July 1, 2025 (≈8 weeks).  
   - If timeframe halved: still no signals, probability remains near zero.  
   - If doubled (16 weeks): marginal increase if a late rollout occurs, but still low given historical lead times.

4. Justification of inside view  
   Base‐rate (outside view) 5% reflects rare late announcements and absence of precedent for sub‐1-year lead.  
   Current factors (no bid news, historical norms) point toward even lower likelihood.  
   Thus adjust downward modestly to 3%.

5. Other considerations  
   - Sub‐factors for “Yes”: A sudden press‐release or leak; unexpected late bid success; emergency relocation by another country. All absent.  
   - Status quo: No announcement by July 1 implies “No.” Common pattern.

Probability calibration  
Outside view base rate (ITKF selection history): 5%  
Inside view adjustments: –2ppt for absence of any Egypt bid/announcement  
Final inside view: 3%

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will ITKF announce Egypt as 2026 World Championship host by July 1, 2025?  
2. Outside view base rate: ~5% (rare late or sub–12-month announcements).  
3. Consistency: 3 out of 100 times, a late/noiseless host announcement for Egypt occurs.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Past hosts announced ≥12 months before event (Strong).  
   • No Egypt bid or selection news to date (Moderate).  
   • ITKF communications silent on 2026 host (Moderate).  
   • Egypt’s hosting of unrelated events doesn’t imply ITKF decision (Weak).  
5. Blind‐spot: ITKF might have a private agreement leaked late; this would increase probability.

2. itkf.global 2025 calendar (Jan-2025 scrape, not shown here but referenced).  Authoritative; shows events ≤12 months ahead, nothing for 2026 Worlds.  
3. Facebook “ITKF Africa” page – no accessible content, therefore unusable.  
4. FISU press release (10 Feb 2025).  Reputable multisport body; shows Egypt (Sharm El-Sheikh) winning a 2026 university event bid—reliable but only indirectly relevant.  
5. Palestine Chronicle archive page – contains no material on ITKF; ignored for forecasting.

b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence – none bearing directly on an ITKF announcement.  
Moderate evidence  
• ITKF has historically announced World-Championship hosts 18-30 months beforehand (Portugal 2024 named in 2022).  
• Egypt successfully hosted the 2014 Worlds and just topped the 2024 medal table, signalling capacity and influence.  
• Other federations (e.g., FISU) are awarding Egypt 2026 events, suggesting active government backing for that year.  
Weak evidence  
• General interest in Africa rotation (only 1 of last 4 ITKF Worlds).  
• Absence of 2026 host on ITKF calendar as of Jan-2025.

Weighting: historic lead-time and the current absence of an announcement are the heaviest factors (moderate evidence, negative direction); Egypt’s capacity/influence and 2026 bidding posture are moderate, positive.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until question closes: 54.  If deadline were doubled (≈4 months), probability would rise a little (to ~6 %) because late announcements become more plausible.  If halved (≈1 month), probability would drop (to ~3 %)—insufficient time to finalise and publish.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base (see below) puts P≈5 %.  
Negative adjustments  
• ITKF normally announces ≥16 months out; we are already inside that window (–2  pp).  
Positive adjustments  
• Egypt has prior hosting experience and just won the team title (+1  pp).  
• Egypt is lining up other 2026 events, demonstrating willingness (+0.5  pp).  

Net inside-view probability ≈4 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 4 times in 100 comparable situations the ITKF (or a similar mid-tier federation) will announce Egypt as the host within the next 54 days.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will ITKF, before 1 Jul 2025, publicly state that Egypt will host the 2026 Traditional Karate Worlds?”  
2. Outside-view base: 5 %.  
3. Consistency: “4 out of 100 times, ITKF will make that announcement by the deadline.”  
4. Key evidence: a) No 2026 host on Jan-2025 calendar; b) Typical 18-30 month lead time; c) Egypt successful host in 2014; d) Egypt tops 2024 medals; e) Egypt wins other 2026 sport bids.  
5. Blind-spot: ITKF secretly selected Egypt in Oct-2024 and plans to reveal it at a late-May 2025 congress.  Would push probability much higher.  
6. Status-quo: Most likely outcome is still “no announcement.”

Probability: 4%


Predicted Probability: 4.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **Palestine Chronicle (solidarity tag page)**
   - Collection of brief articles about Palestine solidarity actions, protests, and initiatives
   - No relevance to karate championships or Egypt's hosting prospects
   - Low reliability for our question; appears to be from 2022-2023

2. **ITKF World Championship in Portugal article**
   - Details the 22nd ITKF World Championship held October 7-13, 2024 in Portugal
   - High reliability as it appears to be an official or federation-endorsed report
   - Factual information: Egypt won first place in team standings, ahead of Brazil and Poland
   - Includes quotes from ITKF Chairman Gilberto Gaertner and other officials
   - Published likely late 2024

3. **Facebook ITKF Africa page**
   - Only cookie consent notice visible; no substantive information accessible
   - Cannot assess quality or relevance for our question

4. **FISU Executive Committee article**
   - Official FISU announcement dated February 10, 2025
   - High reliability as an official statement
   - Factual information: Egypt (Sharm El-Sheikh) will host the 2026 FISU Finswimming Championship
   - No mention of karate or ITKF
   - Shows Egypt's current capability to secure international sporting events

5. **Outside view prediction**
   - Comprehensive analysis of ITKF hosting patterns and Egypt's history
   - Contemporary (May 2025) and directly relevant
   - Factual information: ITKF typically announces 2-3 years in advance; Egypt hosted in 2014; no documented evidence of a 2026 bid

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **No public bid documentation exists** - Multiple searches show no evidence of Egypt submitting a bid for 2026, despite ITKF's typically transparent processes involving government approvals and federation votes.
- **Timeline discrepancy** - Historical pattern shows ITKF announces hosts 24-36 months in advance (2023-2024 for a 2026 event), yet we're in May 2025 with no announcement.
- **Absence from official ITKF communications** - The federation has announced events for 2024-2025 with no mention of 2026 plans or Egypt's involvement.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Egypt's competitive success** - First place at the 2024 World Championship demonstrates Egypt's current prominence in traditional karate.
- **Previous hosting experience** - Egypt successfully hosted the 17th Championship in 2014, proving capability.
- **Concurrent international event hosting** - Egypt secured the 2026 FISU Finswimming Championship, showing government support for hosting international sporting events.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Potential COVID disruptions** - The pandemic may have delayed ITKF's normal processes, though without specific evidence.
- **Limited transparency** - ITKF may not publicize all aspects of its selection process, though this contradicts normal federation practices.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Today is May 8, 2025, with 53 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline.

If this timeframe were halved (26-27 days), my prediction would be even more confident in a negative outcome. Such short notice for announcing a major international championship host would be extremely unusual and logistically problematic.

If doubled (106 days), my prediction would shift only marginally. While providing more time, we would still be well outside the typical 2-3 year announcement window, and the complete lack of public information about an Egyptian bid would remain highly significant.

The timeframe is critical because as we approach July 1 without any indication of Egypt's candidacy, the probability diminishes substantially. International championship preparations require extensive lead time for logistics, venue readiness, and promotional activities.

## (d) Justification

The outside view base rate of 12% already accounts for the historical patterns in ITKF host selections and Egypt's previous hosting experience. Several current factors further reduce this probability:

1. **Complete absence of documentation** - In international sport federation procedures, bid submissions generate multiple documentation points (expressions of interest, formal submissions, site inspections). The total absence of any such documentation for Egypt is compelling negative evidence.

2. **Severe timeline deviation** - We're 5-17 months behind ITKF's normal announcement schedule. This represents a significant departure from established practices that would typically require extraordinary circumstances to justify.

3. **No parallel preparation signals** - Major championships require venue preparations, budget allocations, and organizational groundwork, which typically generate media coverage and official communications. The absence of any such signals from Egypt is telling.

Factors that slightly mitigate these negative signals:

1. **Egypt's current sporting prominence** - Winning the 2024 World Championship puts Egypt in a strong position within the ITKF community.

2. **Demonstrated international event hosting capacity** - Egypt's successful bid for the 2026 FISU Finswimming Championship shows current government willingness to support international sporting events.

However, these positive factors are insufficient to overcome the procedural and timeline evidence. While Egypt has the credentials to be a credible host, the lack of any documented bid process strongly suggests they are not actively pursuing the 2026 championship, or if they were, the bid was unsuccessful.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 12%, I need to adjust based on the current evidence.

The strongest negative signals are:
- Complete absence of any bid documentation or news (strong evidence)
- Significant deviation from normal announcement timeline (strong evidence)
- No preparation signals from Egyptian karate authorities (moderate evidence)

These factors collectively suggest a downward adjustment is warranted. The procedural aspects of international sport event bidding are highly structured, and the absence of evidence across multiple potential documentation points is particularly compelling.

The positive signals (Egypt's competitive success and other 2026 hosting activities) demonstrate capability but not intent for this specific championship.

Considering the remaining timeframe (53 days) and the weight of evidence, I adjust the probability downward to 10%. This reflects that while not impossible, an announcement of Egypt as the 2026 host would require extraordinary circumstances that contradict established ITKF patterns.

# Checklist:

1. Will the ITKF announce before July 1, 2025 that Egypt will host their 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?

2. Outside view base rate: 12%

3. In 10 out of 100 similar scenarios, Egypt would be announced as the 2026 ITKF World Championship host before July 1, 2025.

4. Key evidence: No bid documentation exists despite ITKF's transparent processes; currently 5-17 months behind normal announcement schedule; Egypt won 2024 Championship showing prominence; Egypt is hosting other 2026 international events.

5. Blind spot: A confidential selection process may have already chosen Egypt with announcement strategically delayed until June 2025.

6. Status quo is no announcement, which remains highly likely given timeframe and documentation gaps.

Probability: 10%
Predicted Probability: 10.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:
1. **ITKF World Championship Article (itkf.global)** - Highly authoritative source from the official ITKF website about the 2024 Championship in Portugal (October 2024). Factually reports Egypt winning the 2024 team championship. Contains official quotes from ITKF Chairman and other officials about event management and competition quality.

2. **FISU Executive Committee Article (February 10, 2025)** - Recent reliable information about the International University Sports Federation announcing host cities for 2026 championships, including Egypt hosting finswimming in Sharm El-Sheikh. Demonstrates Egypt's active engagement in bidding for international sporting events.

3. **Palestine Chronicle Archive** - Unrelated to karate or sports; irrelevant to our question.

4. **Facebook ITKF Africa** - Only cookie consent information captured; no usable content for analysis.

5. **Outside View Analysis** - Provides historical context on ITKF host selection patterns (2012-2024) with Poland, Egypt (2014), Slovenia, and Portugal hosting previous championships.

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong evidence:**
- ITKF's consistent pattern of announcing hosts approximately 2 years before events (structural factor)
- No public indication of Egypt's bid for 2026 by May 2025 despite being less than 8 months from 2026 (institutional factor)
- No mention of 2026 host selection on ITKF's official communications or calendar (institutional factor)

**Moderate evidence:**
- Egypt finished 1st in team standings at the 2024 Championship (demonstrates competitive prominence)
- Egypt successfully secured a 2026 FISU Championship for finswimming (shows current capability in hosting international sports events)
- Egypt has previously hosted the ITKF World Championship in 2014 (historical precedent)

**Weak evidence:**
- The complete absence of any public discussion about 2026 hosting selections in recent ITKF communications

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Current timeframe: May 8, 2025 to July 1, 2025 (~54 days)
- If the timeframe were halved (~27 days), the probability would decrease further, as it would leave even less time for an unexpected announcement
- If the timeframe were doubled (~108 days), the probability might increase slightly but would still be low given ITKF's typical 2-year lead time for host announcements
- We are now less than 8 months from 2026, significantly outside the normal 24±6 month announcement window

## (d) Justification:

The outside view gave us a 10% probability based primarily on ITKF's historical announcement patterns. Current evidence provides some factors that could slightly adjust this probability:

**Factors potentially increasing probability:**
1. Egypt's current strength in traditional karate (1st place in 2024 Championship)
2. Egypt has previously hosted successfully (2014) and thus has infrastructure experience
3. Egypt is actively securing other international sporting events (FISU 2026)
4. There could be undisclosed negotiations or an emergency fast-track process

**Factors strongly decreasing probability:**
1. Complete absence of public information about an Egyptian bid by May 2025
2. The extremely short timeframe remaining (54 days)
3. ITKF's consistent pattern of announcing hosts ~2 years in advance (never <1 year)
4. No mention of 2026 host selection process in any recent ITKF communications

The structural and timing factors substantially outweigh the factors favoring Egypt as a potential host. While Egypt has demonstrated capacity and prominence in the sport, the institutional pattern of ITKF making these announcements well in advance (typically 2 years) is extremely consistent, and we've seen no deviation from this pattern.

# Probability calibration

The outside view gave us a 10% baseline probability. After weighing the evidence:

- The historical timing pattern is extremely strong evidence against an announcement within our timeframe
- Egypt's prominence in the sport and previous hosting experience are moderate factors in favor
- Egypt's demonstrated capacity for hosting international events in 2026 (FISU) provides a slight boost
- The complete absence of any preparatory signals by May 2025 strongly suggests no announcement is imminent

I'm adjusting the probability only slightly upward from the outside view, from 10% to 12%. This small increase acknowledges Egypt's strong position while still recognizing the overwhelming timing constraints and ITKF's established processes.

# Checklist:
1. Resolution criteria: Will ITKF announce before July 1, 2025 that Egypt will host the 2026 World Championship?
2. Base rate: 10% based on historical ITKF announcement patterns
3. Consistency: In 12 out of 100 similar scenarios, ITKF would announce Egypt as 2026 host before July 1
4. Key evidence: ITKF normally announces hosts ~2 years ahead; Egypt won 2024 Championship; No public bid visible with <8 months to 2026; Only 54 days remain until resolution
5. Blind spot: ITKF might face an emergency where Egypt is the only capable rapid-deployment option
6. Status quo: No host announced yet; short timeframe favors continued non-announcement

Probability: 12%
Predicted Probability: 12.0%

Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
- Perplexity report on ITKF host selections (high credibility; late April–May 2025).  Documents past hosts (2012–2024), bidding procedures, and notes no evidence Egypt submitted a bid for 2026.  
- ITKF official events page (high credibility; accessed early May 2025).  Lists events through 2025; no mention of 2026 host.  
- ITKF news on 22nd World Championship in Portugal (Gilberto Gaertner quotes; Oct 2024).  Describes success of the recent event, but no hint on 2026 bidding.  
- FISU article on 2026 World University Championships hosts (moderate relevance; Feb 2025).  Illustrates timing and formal awarding processes for another sports federation, but unrelated to ITKF.  
- Palestine Chronicle “Solidarity” archive & ITKF Africa Facebook (low relevance; various dates).  No information about 2026 ITKF host selection.

2. Evidence analysis  
- Strong evidence:  
  • Historical pattern—ITKF announces hosts 2–3 years ahead (hosts for 2024 were selected in 2022).  
  • No documented Egyptian bid—as reported by Perplexity. A formal bid is a necessary precondition.  
  • Institutional requirement—selection needs a national bid plus ITKF General Assembly approval, which is normally publicized.  
- Moderate evidence:  
  • Egypt hosted in 2014—shows precedent but long interval (12 years) reduces urgency/momentum.  
- Weak evidence:  
  • Analogy to FISU timelines—interesting but federations differ.

3. Timeframe analysis  
- There are 53 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline.  
- Halved timeframe (≈26 days) would further reduce chances, as formal processes take weeks.  
- Doubled timeframe (≈106 days) might modestly increase likelihood if a delayed announcement emerges, but would still require a rapid bid, vote and PR cycle.

4. Justification  
Our outside-view base-rate (historical pattern) suggests the 2026 ITKF host would have been announced by mid-2024. The absence of any public bid or announcement for Egypt by May 2025, combined with the formal requirements (bid submission, government sign-off, ITKF vote), makes a last-minute announcement unlikely. The few remaining days provide too short a runway for the necessary procedural steps and global publicity. Thus, we shift our base rate (≈8%) downward to reflect these strong disconfirming signals.

Probability calibration  
I started with an out-of-sample baseline of 8% (derived from historical announcement timing and bidding prevalence). The strong evidence of no bid and no announcement, plus procedural lead-time constraints, warrants a moderate downward adjustment. I settle on a 5% estimate for Egypt being named host before July 1, 2025.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will ITKF announce Egypt as 2026 host by July 1 2025?  
2. Base rate: Historically, hosts are named ~2–3 years ahead (so normally announced by 2023–24).  
3. Consistency: 5 out of 100 times, a country without a documented bid and with procedural timeline constraints gets announced last-minute.  
4. Key evidence:  
   - No bid documented (strong)  
   - Typical 2–3 years lead time (strong)  
   - Formal approval process would be public (strong)  
   - 53 days left (moderate)  
5. Blind spot: ITKF could have secret negotiated a deal with Egypt and simply hasn’t publicized interim steps—if true, probability could jump.  
6. Status quo: No public info by May 2025 suggests “No announcement” is the default.

Probability: 05%
Predicted Probability: 5.0%

Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
   - Palestine Chronicle archive (May ’25): Aggregates “solidarity” items; no mention of ITKF or hosting bids. Low relevance; factual snippets.  
   - ITKF global news on 2024 Portugal Worlds (Oct ’24): Authoritative recap of event, no reference to 2026 bids. Reliable, factual.  
   - Facebook ITKF Africa page (accessed ’25): Only cookie‐consent; no substantive hosting info. Irrelevant.  
   - ITKF events page (late ’24 Peru/Argentina): Official schedule listings; no 2026 host details. Reliable, factual.  
   - Google query “Egypt ITKF 2026 host bid news” (May ’25): No hits. Negative evidence for a public Egyptian bid. Low‐strength.  
   - Perplexity timeline report (AI summary): Cites past host‐selection patterns; no Egypt bid mentioned. Treat cautiously.  
   - FISU 2026 host awards (Feb ’25): Lists Egypt hosting FISU finswimming, but unrelated federation. Indicates Egypt’s sports hosting interest but not in karate.

2. Evidence analysis  
   - Historical pattern: All past ITKF World Championship hosts announced ≥12 months before event (Strong).  
   - No public signals of an Egyptian bid or selection by May ’25 (Moderate).  
   - ITKF communications focus on internal events and tech upgrades, not on pending host announcements (Moderate).  
   - Egypt’s broader sports hosting (e.g. FISU) suggests capacity but no link to ITKF decision (Weak).

3. Timeframe analysis  
   - Today: May 8, 2025. Resolution deadline: July 1, 2025 (≈8 weeks).  
   - If timeframe halved: still no signals, probability remains near zero.  
   - If doubled (16 weeks): marginal increase if a late rollout occurs, but still low given historical lead times.

4. Justification of inside view  
   Base‐rate (outside view) 5% reflects rare late announcements and absence of precedent for sub‐1-year lead.  
   Current factors (no bid news, historical norms) point toward even lower likelihood.  
   Thus adjust downward modestly to 3%.

5. Other considerations  
   - Sub‐factors for “Yes”: A sudden press‐release or leak; unexpected late bid success; emergency relocation by another country. All absent.  
   - Status quo: No announcement by July 1 implies “No.” Common pattern.

Probability calibration  
Outside view base rate (ITKF selection history): 5%  
Inside view adjustments: –2ppt for absence of any Egypt bid/announcement  
Final inside view: 3%

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will ITKF announce Egypt as 2026 World Championship host by July 1, 2025?  
2. Outside view base rate: ~5% (rare late or sub–12-month announcements).  
3. Consistency: 3 out of 100 times, a late/noiseless host announcement for Egypt occurs.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Past hosts announced ≥12 months before event (Strong).  
   • No Egypt bid or selection news to date (Moderate).  
   • ITKF communications silent on 2026 host (Moderate).  
   • Egypt’s hosting of unrelated events doesn’t imply ITKF decision (Weak).  
5. Blind‐spot: ITKF might have a private agreement leaked late; this would increase probability.  
6. Status quo: World championships hosts are chosen early; default is “No announcement.”
