Analysis:
To establish an out-view baseline for the probability of another coup by July 1, 2025, I need systematic counts of successful coups in both Africa and Latin America over the past two decades. This includes frequency per year, clustering (e.g., Sahel after 2020), and regional drivers—political crises, contested elections, economic shocks, military strength, external backers. Comparing Africa’s recent coup wave with Latin America’s relative post-1980s stability will anchor our base rate before we adjust for current variables.

Analysis:
This question hinges on whether ongoing political instability or emerging security crises in Africa or Latin America tip into a full-fledged, successful coup before July 1, 2025. Our out-view baseline is the recent coup wave in Africa (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Gabon) and isolated Latin America attempts (Peru self-coup, Bolivia June 2024), suggesting a moderate recurring risk in Africa and low but nonzero risk in Latin America. To form an inside view, we need up-to-date reporting on at-risk countries—e.g., signs of elite infighting, military grievances, popular unrest or weak civilian oversight—in both regions. Key targets include Sudan, Guinea-Bissau, Chad, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Venezuela, Peru, and others where coups or high-level mutinies have trended historically. We also want expert analyses or think-tank warnings of possible coup plotting or shifts in foreign military support. These articles will help adjust our base-rate probability up or down.

<Summary source="http://www.privatemilitary.org/adverse/military_coups_africa.html">
Here is a concise summary of the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs article “Understanding Africa’s Recent Coups” (April 13, 2024):

1. Scope and Context  
- Since 2020 there have been nine successful military coups in Africa, plus at least nine failed attempts, largely concentrated in a Francophone “Sahelian coup belt.”  
- Apart from Gabon, all these countries are classified by the UN as Least Developed Countries.  
- Drivers include pandemic-related economic stagnation, climate shocks, food insecurity, weak governance and divided international responses.

2. Diversity of Coup Motivations  
- Security failures: Burkina Faso (Sept 2022) ousted Damiba over inability to counter an Islamic insurgency; Mali’s May 2021 coup (Goïta/CNSP) cited jihadi territorial gains.  
- “Anti-autocratic” framing: Guinea (Sept 2021) over term-limit abolition; Gabon (Aug 2023) over allegedly fraudulent election—junta called it a “Freedom Coup.” A failed Nov 2023 coup in Sierra Leone also followed disputed elections.  
- Dynastic/insider power grabs: Chad’s Mahamat Déby (post-2021 death of his father); Niger’s July 2023 coup (General Tchiani) officially blamed security/economic failures but widely seen as a bid to avert his removal.

3. The “Putschist Playbook”  
- Shared post-coup behavior: cement power indefinitely by claiming popular backing.  
- Tactics include:  
  • Rallying youth via anti-colonial/anti-French rhetoric.  
  • Cultivating external patrons (e.g. Russia) for praetorian guard services.  
  • Negotiating long transition timetables—average post-coup return to constitutional rule in the Sahel is now ~3 years.  
- Illustrative timetables:  
  • Mali & Burkina Faso promised 2024 elections, but Mali has suspended all political activity.  
  • Guinea set a two-year transition ending Jan 2025.  
  • Chad’s 18-month promise was extended by two more years in 2022.  
  • Gabon’s junta floated August 2025 for elections.

4. Erosion of Anti-Coup Norms  
- The 2000 Lomé Declaration (which mandated AU suspension of coup makers) once cut coup attempts by >50% vs. 1960–2000 rates.  
- Post-2017, AU has failed to enforce Lomé on Zimbabwe (2017), Sudan (2019), Chad (2022). Its deterrent effect has waned.  
- ECOWAS: unable to agree on military action in Niger, then weakened further when Niger, Mali and Burkina withdrew (Jan 2024), prompting ECOWAS to lift most Niger sanctions and reopen dialogue.  
- International community divided: counter-terrorism interests have led Morocco, Turkey, UAE to engage pragmatically with juntas; fear of pushing them toward Russia limits coordinated pressure.

5. Author’s Key Observations  
- Labeling an “African coup wave” masks diverse coup rationales.  
- Putschists learn from one another: promise transitions, then extend them to consolidate power.  
- Disunity among African regional bodies and global powers has emboldened coup leaders to gamble on holding power indefinitely.

<Summary source="https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2024/04/13/understanding-africas-coups/">
Disclaimer: This summary is based solely on the provided Fragile States Index article.

Key trends and facts  
• Since early 2021, West and Central Africa have seen an unprecedented wave of military coups, reversing two decades of norms established by the 2000 Lomé Declaration.  
• Coups or coup attempts since 2021 include:  
  – Chad (2021)  
  – Guinea (Sept. 5, 2021)  
  – Mali (Aug. 18, 2020; May 24, 2021)  
  – Sudan (2021)  
  – Burkina Faso (early 2022)  
  – Foiled attempt in Niger (March 2021)  

Drivers of the coup wave  
• Eroded public confidence in democratic institutions amid rising social and economic stresses.  
• Security crises—especially in Mali, where Tuareg rebellions beginning in 2012 and the rise of Islamist militants prompted French Operation Barkhane (2013) and the UN’s MINUSMA mission.  
• Contagion effect: successive coups in neighboring states have destabilized norms.  
• According to Afrobarometer:  
  – 82% of Malians trust the military; only 47% trust the president.  
  – Most Guineans and Malians profess a preference for democracy but lack confidence in civilian institutions.  

Case studies  
1. Guinea (Sept. 2021)  
  – Trigger: 2020 constitutional referendum allowing President Alpha Condé a third term and disputed legislative elections.  
  – Colonel Mamady Doumbouya announced on state TV that Condé was detained and the constitution dissolved.  
  – Regional response: ECOWAS suspended Guinea’s membership and imposed sanctions; the AU and UN condemned the coup.  
  – Transition measures: formation of a Conseil National de Transition (CNT); appointment of civilian Prime Minister Mohamed Béavogui (Oct. 6, 2021); creation of a special court for financial crimes; vetting of senior officials. As of the article’s writing, elections mandated within six months by ECOWAS had not been held.  

2. Mali (Aug. 2020 and May 2021)  
  – August 2020: Colonel Assimi Goïta ousted President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta amid protests over security failures and disputed legislative results.  
  – May 2021: Goïta arrested interim President Bah N’Daw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane over a proposed cabinet reshuffle.  
  – Public protests by the M5-RFP movement contested April 2021 elections in which opposition leader Soumaila Cissé was absent.  
  – International reaction: AU and ECOWAS suspended Mali; widespread condemnation by the United States and United Nations.  
  – Transition challenges: interim parliament authorized military rule for up to five years (Feb. 21, 2022); French forces withdrew from Timbuktu (Dec. 14, 2021); Mali entered talks with Russia’s Wagner Group.  

Underlying drivers and outlook  
• Fragile States Index data show worsening “State Legitimacy” and rising “Group Grievance” in Guinea and Mali since 2005.  
• While sanctions and suspensions reaffirm norms, they do little to alleviate the root causes—economic hardship, insecurity, and public disillusionment.  
• The article argues that unless democratic governance can tangibly address these stresses, future coups may remain an attractive outlet for popular frustration.

<Summary source="https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/">
Disclaimer: Summary is based solely on the VOA “By the Numbers: Coups in Africa” (Megan Duzor & Brian Williamson).

Key Facts & Statistics  
• Recent surge: In the past three years, successful military takeovers occurred in Gabon, Niger, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Guinea, Chad and Mali.  
• Regional response: After Niger’s July 2023 coup, ECOWAS imposed sanctions and threatened force “to restore that country’s democratically elected government” (Abdel-Fatau Musah, ECOWAS Commissioner).  
• Coup “epidemic”: UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned after Sudan’s October 2021 coup of “an environment in which some military leaders feel they have total impunity.”  
• Long-term trends: 1950–Oct 3 2023, of 492 global coup attempts, Africa accounted for 220 and 109 successful coups (data from Jonathan Powell & Clayton Thyne).  
• Pre-2021 decline: In the decade before 2021, Africa averaged fewer than one successful coup per year (Powell & Thyne).  
• Economic correlates: Gabon, Niger, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Chad and Mali each had GDPs under $22 billion in 2022; Sudan’s was $52 billion. By contrast, the U.S. GDP was $25 trillion (World Bank 2022).  
• Risk factors: Countries facing terrorism/insurgencies or leaders seen as illegitimate are more coup-prone (Powell). The Sahel region remains especially vulnerable.  

Regional & Historical Context  
• Coup prevalence: Since 1950, 45 of 54 African states have seen at least one coup attempt; 37 (≈two-thirds) recorded a successful takeover (per Powell & Thyne’s ≥7-day rule).  
• Country hotspots:  
 – Sudan: 18 coup attempts, six successful (including Oct 2021). An April 2023 clash between the army and paramilitary RSF was classified as an attempted coup.  
 – Burkina Faso: Nine successful coups (1966, ’74, ’80, ’82, ’83, ’87, 2014, Jan 2022, Sept 2022) plus a 2015 attempt.  
 – Nigeria: Eight attempts since 1960 (six successful), but no coups since 1999, with power transfers via elections.  

Definitions & Data Notes (Powell & Thyne)  
• Coup: Illegal, overt efforts by military or state elites to unseat the executive. Success requires holding power ≥7 days and overcoming resistance.  
• Perpetrators: Must have formal state ties; civilian instigators count if the military later intervenes. Foreign-led interventions are excluded.  
• Data sources: Arrested Dictatorship website; Cline Center, Univ. of Illinois; VOA research.  

Drivers & Dynamics  
• Governance deficits: The African Union Peace & Security Council (2014) links coups to “deficiencies in governance,” corruption, rights abuses, refusal to accept electoral defeat, and constitutional manipulation.  
• Civil society & history: Strong civil society, government legitimacy and past coup experience predict future coups (Aaron Belkin & Evan Schofer).  
• “Coup traps”: Recent coups can trigger counter-coups. Example: Mali had no coups for 20 years, then four attempts in the past decade.  
• Case studies:  
 – Mali 2020 & 2021: Assimi Goïta led the August 2020 coup citing popular dissatisfaction, then overthrew the transitional government in May 2021 over a cabinet reshuffle—what French President Macron called “a coup within a coup.”  
 – Gabon 2023: Military seized power after elections extending the Bongo family’s five-decade rule.

Highlight major political, economic, and military drivers and any observable trends or clusters. Explain how these historical patterns inform the baseline likelihood of another successful coup by mid-2025.
# Coups d’État in Africa and Latin America Since 2000: Patterns, Drivers, and Future Risks  

The early 21st century has witnessed a resurgence of military coups, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, challenging democratic norms and destabilizing regions already grappling with security crises, economic inequality, and governance deficits. Since 2000, Africa has experienced **26 successful coups**, predominantly in Francophone nations, while Latin America has seen **6 successful overthrows**, often linked to U.S. interventions and domestic political fractures[6][9]. This report analyzes the frequency, drivers, and outcomes of these coups, identifies regional clusters, and evaluates the likelihood of future incidents by mid-2025.

## Drivers of Coups  

### Political and Military Fragility  
- **Weak Governance:** 72% of African coups since 2020 occurred in states with "electoral autocracies" (e.g., Niger, Gabon) where leaders extended term limits[5][11].  
- **Security Failures:** Jihadist violence in the Sahel weakened public trust in civilian governments, enabling military actors to position themselves as stabilizers[1][3].  
- **Military Privileges:** Elite presidential guards in Francophone Africa, better-armed than national armies, executed 80% of recent coups[3][7].  

### Economic Strains  
- **Resource Curse:** High reliance on extractive industries (oil in Gabon, gold in Sudan) exacerbated corruption and inequality, fueling unrest[5][6].  
- **Inflation:** Sub-Saharan Africa’s average inflation of 12.4% in 2022–2023 eroded living standards, creating fertile ground for military populism[11].  

### Foreign Influence  
- **Anti-French Sentiment:** France’s counterterrorism failures in the Sahel and perceived neocolonialism drove military alliances with Russia[3][6].  
- **U.S. Interventions:** CIA-backed regime-change efforts in Venezuela (2002) and Bolivia (2019) destabilized leftist governments[4][13].  

---

## Trends and Clusters  

### Africa’s "Coup Wave" (2020–2023)  
- **Frequency:** 9 successful coups in 3 years, compared to 4 in the prior decade[5][6].  
- **Regional Spread:** 85% occurred in Francophone nations, forming a contiguous Sahelian belt[6][9].  

### Latin America’s Declining Incidence  
- **Post-2000 Decline:** Only 2 coups post-2010 (Bolivia 2019, Venezuela 2002), linked to stronger democratic institutions and reduced U.S. direct intervention[8][11].  

---

## Projected Likelihood of Future Coups (2024–2025)  

### Africa’s Persistent Risks  
- **Sahelian Instability:** Jihadist control of 40% of Burkina Faso and Mali heightens military frustration, increasing coup risks by 65%[1][6].  
- **Governance Deficits:** 15 African leaders have altered constitutions since 2015 to extend terms, a key coup predictor[3][7].  

### Latin America’s Latent Threats  
- **Economic Volatility:** Argentina (160% inflation) and Venezuela (400% inflation) face heightened military restiveness[11][12].  
- **U.S. Strategic Interests:** Continued sanctions against Venezuela and Cuba could provoke regime-change efforts[4][13].  

---

## Conclusion  

The Sahel remains the epicenter of coup activity, with military factions leveraging security crises and anti-colonial rhetoric to justify takeovers. Latin America, while less volatile, faces risks from economic collapses and external interference. By mid-2025, the baseline likelihood of another successful coup exceeds 50% in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Venezuela, driven by unresolved governance failures and geopolitical contestation[1][11]. Mitigating these risks requires addressing root causes: inclusive elections, economic diversification, and demilitarization of politics.

ECOWAS Summit Decision  
• At its December 15, 2024 summit in Abuja, Nigeria, the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) approved a timetable for the withdrawal of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, whose military juntas announced in January 2024 they would quit the bloc.  
• ECOWAS Commission President Omar Alieu Touray said the three countries would have a “transitional period” from January 29 to July 29, 2025, during which they remain formally members and “ECOWAS doors” stay open for a possible return.

Background and Member Responses  
• The juntas of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso accused ECOWAS of “inhumane and irresponsible” sanctions tied to the coups and of failing to address their security crises.  
• So far, those governments have largely rejected calls to reverse their withdrawal. They are exploring issuing travel documents outside ECOWAS systems and forming a separate alliance.  
• In July 2024, Touray warned that leaving ECOWAS risks losing benefits such as visa-free movement. The three countries later said they will keep visa-free entry for West African citizens but “reserve the right” to refuse entry to those they deem inadmissible.

Reactions from ECOWAS Leadership  
• President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria (ECOWAS chairman) stressed the bloc must “protect our citizens and create an enabling environment where they can prosper.”  
• Touray praised the bloc’s envoys for their yearlong mediation, calling it “a collective commitment to preserving peace and unity” in West Africa.

• Babacar Ndiaye (Timbuktu Institute for Peace Studies) called this development “ECOWAS’s biggest challenge since inception” in 1975 and doubted the juntas would rejoin without a clear return to democracy.  
• Mucahid Durmaz (Verisk Maplecroft) argued that ECOWAS’s “inconsistent responses to coups” suggest its stance is driven more by member states’ political interests than by its founding democratic principles, warning that legitimizing the juntas could spur further regional fragmentation.

Summary of “10 Conflicts to Watch in 2025” (Crisis Group, Jan 1 2025):

1. Global Flashpoints  
  • Middle East: Hamas’s 7 Oct 2023 attack on Israel triggered massive Israeli reprisals in Gaza, degradation of Iran-backed proxies, strikes on Iran itself, and—unintentionally—the fall of the Assad regime to Islamist rebels in Syria.  
  • Asia: Rising US–China–ally competition creates tensions over the South China Sea, Taiwan, and the Korean Peninsula.  
  • Europe: Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine aims to upend post–Cold War security and risks wider confrontation.

2. “Elsewhere” Conflicts  
  • Myanmar’s civil war continues.  
  • A Rwanda-backed rebellion flares in eastern DR Congo.  
  • Gang violence in Haiti has plunged millions into “warlike conditions.”  
  • Sudan remains devastated by internal fighting.  
  • Global casualties, displacement, and hunger from armed conflict are at decades-high levels.

3. Underlying Dynamics  
  • Erosion of US hegemony emboldens leaders to use violence when they see opportunity or fear falling behind.  
  • With no unified great-power check, states and proxies act more freely; the main constraint is adversaries’ capacity to resist.  
  • Interconnected conflicts yield unexpected spill-overs (e.g., Israel’s Lebanon strikes aiding al-Qaeda offshoots).

4. Impact of a Trump Presidency  
  • Trump’s “impetuousness” could deter rivals and extract concessions, but also risks miscalculations along major-power fault lines.  
  • Contradictory signals on NATO and Asian alliances raise questions: Will Trump double down on confrontation or pursue deals?  
  • Allies such as the Philippines, Taiwan or Israel might overstep, provoking Chinese or Iranian retaliation that could drag in the US.

5. Rival Cooperation and “Axis” Talk  
  • Claims of a China-Russia-North Korea-Iran “axis” are overstated; shared goal is resisting US power, not strategic alignment.  
  • Nonetheless, Iran and North Korea supply arms (and potentially troops) to Russia in Ukraine; a November defense pact links Pyongyang to Moscow’s war.

6. Prospects for Deals  
  • Grand bargains (US acceptance of Chinese primacy in Asia or Russian demands on Ukraine) are unlikely to stick.  
  • Smaller confidence-building measures—military hotlines, regular talks—could stabilize US–China relations.  
  • A ceasefire in Ukraine or revived nuclear talks with North Korea or Iran offer imperfect but preferable alternatives to continued escalation.

Key facts and figures  
• Mutiny reports: Soldiers in Kati (15 km from Bamako) have taken up arms amid opposition calls for President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s ouster.  
• Protests: Tens of thousands in Bamako, led by the “June 5 Movement,” demand Keita step down over alleged electoral fraud, corruption, economic collapse and security failures.  
• Electoral controversy:  
  – Keita’s contested re-election in August 2018 triggered opposition claims of irregularities.  
  – March 2020 legislative polls went ahead despite COVID-19; the Constitutional Court then overturned 31 results, giving Keita’s party 10 extra seats.  
  – Opposition leader Soumaila Cissé was abducted in March while campaigning; his fate remains unknown.  
• Economic hardship: Mali’s economy—dependent on gold and cotton—has been battered by the security crisis and the pandemic. According to World Bank figures, over 40% of Mali’s 20 million people live in extreme poverty. Chronic deficits in roads, power, healthcare, food and water compound grievances; striking teachers have joined protests over unpaid salaries.  
• Security deterioration:  
  – Since 2012, jihadist and ethnic-militia violence has surged: UN data show attacks across Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso rose from about 770 deaths in 2016 to some 4 000 by 2020.  
  – Hundreds of thousands displaced, thousands of schools closed. Central Mali serves as a launchpad for al-Qaeda and ISIL-linked groups. Violence has spilled into Niger and Burkina Faso, creating a wider Sahel humanitarian crisis.  
• Regional and international reactions:  
  – ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) has mediated, urging Keita to form a unity government—but opposition rejects anything short of his departure. ECOWAS warned against “unconstitutional change in power” and called on mutinous soldiers “to return to their barracks without delay.”  
  – France, which has deployed troops since 2013, and other Western powers fear renewed instability could undermine efforts to contain jihadists and trigger another migrant wave toward Europe.  
• Stakes: Regional leaders worry that forcing Keita out by force would set a dangerous precedent for West African democracies.

Article: “South Africa shuts Lebombo border crossing over Mozambique poll violence” (BBC, 6 November 2024)

• Context:  
  – Following Mozambique’s disputed presidential election in late October, won by ruling Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo with 71% of the vote, opposition leader Venâncio Mondlane (20%) went into hiding amid fears for his safety and called a general strike.  
  – Post-election protests in Maputo and surrounding areas have turned violent, with at least 18 people killed (Human Rights Watch) and reports of internet and social media restrictions.

• Border closure:  
  – On 6 November, South Africa’s Border Management Authority (BMA) announced the temporary closure of the Lebombo (Komatipoort) port of entry—one of southern Africa’s four busiest land crossings—citing torched vehicles and buildings on the Mozambican side.  
  – Michael Masiapato, BMA commissioner, said the South African side was not directly affected but that closure was “in the interest of public safety” and that police, army and BMA officials would secure the area and protect travelers.

• Spill-over incidents:  
  – South African police used rubber bullets and stun grenades against Mozambicans attempting to cross (reported by News24).  
  – Seven Mozambican immigration officials have sought refuge on the South African side.  
  – Protests have spread to Ressano Garcia (Maputo province), where an immigration office was burnt.

• Government responses in Mozambique:  
  – Defence Minister Cristóvão Chume warned of deploying the army ahead of planned nationwide demonstrations, accusing protesters of seeking “to change the democratically established power.”  
  – Mondlane’s strike persists despite Prime Minister’s calls to resume work.

Travelers between South Africa and Mozambique have been advised to use alternative border crossings until further notice.

   - Medium-quality source with journalistic rather than academic treatment
   - Factual information includes basic coup details, though dramatic framing suggests entertainment focus
   - Subjective rankings of "boldness" indicate opinion content

5. **VOA "By the Numbers: Coups in Africa"**
   - Statistical overview of African coups with regional and historical context
   - Medium-high quality from government-funded news organization
   - Factual information includes coup statistics, GDP comparisons, country-specific coup histories
   - Contains expert opinions from UN Secretary-General, ECOWAS Commissioner, and academic researchers

6. **Perplexity Report on Coups**
   - Comprehensive summary of successful coups since 2000 and analysis of patterns
   - Medium quality as an aggregator of multiple sources
   - Factual information includes coup events, dates, actors, and outcomes
   - Contains projection that "by mid-2025, the baseline likelihood of another successful coup exceeds 50% in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Venezuela"

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several potential reference classes can be identified:

1. **All coups in Africa and Latin America since 1945**
   - Provides largest sample size but includes outdated patterns from Cold War era

2. **All coups in Africa and Latin America since 2000**
   - Captures modern dynamics while maintaining adequate sample size
   - Includes varying geopolitical conditions across different decades

3. **Coups in Africa and Latin America since 2020**
   - Focuses on the recent "coup wave" in Africa
   - Most relevant to current regional dynamics and contagion effects
   - Captures the current "Sahelian coup belt" pattern

4. **Coups in high-risk regions (Sahel, economically distressed Latin American states)**
   - Narrows focus to most volatile areas
   - May overestimate probability by excluding stable countries

I'll select **Coups in Africa and Latin America since 2020** as the most suitable reference class given its recency and relevance to current geopolitical conditions, particularly the documented "coup wave" in Africa that represents a significant shift from the 2000-2019 pattern.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction requires forecasting coup probability from April 25, 2025, to July 1, 2025 - approximately 67 days (~2.2 months).

From our reference class:
- Since 2020 (~5.25 years), there have been 9 successful coups in Africa according to the Georgetown source
- This represents a rate of ~1.7 successful African coups per year
- Latin America has experienced fewer recent coups, with possibly 1-2 since 2020
- Combined, this suggests roughly 2 successful coups per year across both regions
- For a 2.2-month period, the historical baseline would be ~0.37 expected coups

## (d) Justification

Several factors inform my outside view prediction:

1. **Recent Coup Frequency**: The "coup wave" since 2020 represents a significant increase from the previous decade, with 9 successful coups in Africa in ~5 years compared to an average of less than 1 per year in the 2010s.

2. **Regional Concentration**: Coups have clustered in the "Sahelian coup belt" (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Guinea) where military regimes have consolidated power. The VOA source indicates 45 of 54 African states have experienced at least one coup attempt since 1950, with Sudan (18 attempts) and Burkina Faso (9 successful coups) being particularly coup-prone.

3. **Weakened Anti-Coup Norms**: The Georgetown source identifies erosion of anti-coup norms, with AU and ECOWAS failing to enforce sanctions consistently. The January 2024 withdrawal of Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso from ECOWAS further weakens regional deterrence.

4. **Contagion Effects**: Historical data shows coups often cluster temporally and regionally. The Perplexity report references "coup traps" where recent coups trigger counter-coups.

5. **Current Risk Factors**: Multiple sources identify ongoing drivers including security failures (jihadist insurgencies), term-limit extensions by incumbents, economic hardship, and Russian influence via Wagner Group in the Sahel.

## Outside view calibration:

From our reference class, we observe approximately 2 successful coups per year across Africa and Latin America since 2020. For our 67-day window (about 18.4% of a year), this translates to roughly 0.37 expected successful coups.

Converting this to a probability of at least one successful coup occurring: 1 - e^(-0.37) ≈ 31%. This represents the Poisson probability of at least one event occurring given an average rate of 0.37.

The Perplexity report offers a useful benchmark, stating that "By mid-2025, the baseline likelihood of another successful coup exceeds 50% in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Venezuela." This refers to individual country risks rather than aggregate likelihood, suggesting multiple high-risk countries.

I should note several factors that might modify this baseline:
1. Recent consolidation of power by juntas in key coup-prone countries might temporarily reduce new coup likelihood in those specific countries
2. The continuing erosion of anti-coup norms may slightly increase probability
3. Ongoing security and economic challenges persist in multiple vulnerable states

Balancing these factors, I'll maintain a forecast close to the historical baseline but slightly higher to account for the eroded anti-coup norms and persistent risk factors.

- Limited information available in the excerpt, but represents authoritative statistical tracking
- Primarily factual with minimal interpretive content

**2. Georgetown Journal ("Understanding Africa's Recent Coups")**
- Scholarly analysis documenting nine successful coups in Africa since 2020 plus nine failed attempts
- Identifies the "Sahelian coup belt" in Francophone West Africa as a hotspot
- Key factual information: coup timelines, country-specific details, transition periods
- Expert opinions on motivations (security failures, anti-autocratic sentiment, power struggles)
- Analysis of the "putschist playbook" reflects scholarly interpretation of patterns

**3. Georgetown Journal (Africa's Coup Wave article)**
- Detailed case studies of coups in Guinea and Mali (2020-2021)
- Presents Afrobarometer data showing high military trust vs. low presidential trust
- Factual information on coup events and timelines
- Expert analysis of underlying drivers (eroded confidence, security crises, contagion effect)
- Well-sourced academic perspective focused on 2020-2021 period

**4. Listverse ("The 10 Boldest Coup Attempts")**
- Popular content site highlighting dramatic coup attempts
- Notable mention of a June 2024 Bolivia coup attempt (recent)
- Less rigorous than academic sources; emphasizes narrative over analysis
- Subjective ranking system ("boldest" coups); likely prioritizes sensationalism
- Useful for recent events but not for systematic analysis

**5. VOA "By the Numbers: Coups in Africa"**
- Comprehensive statistical overview with visualizations
- High-quality journalism citing academic data (Powell & Thyne)
- Key facts: Africa accounts for 220 of 492 global coup attempts since 1950; 109 successful
- Documents recent surge (Gabon, Niger, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Guinea, Chad, Mali)
- Includes expert opinions from UN Secretary-General and ECOWAS officials
- Africa-focused; limited Latin America coverage

**6. BBC News article**
- Unrelated to coups (Oscar nominations); not relevant to this analysis

**7. Perplexity Report**
- Comprehensive synthesis documenting 26 African and 6 Latin American coups since 2000
- Systematically analyzes drivers: governance weakness, security failures, economic strains
- Well-organized with regional breakdowns and country-specific details
- Contains expert assessment: "By mid-2025, the baseline likelihood of another successful coup exceeds 50% in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Venezuela"
- Secondary source requiring verification, but provides useful framework

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several possible reference classes emerge:

1. **All coups in Africa and Latin America since 2000** (32 total: 26 Africa, 6 Latin America)
   - Advantages: Matches geographical scope; sufficient sample size; modern political context
   - Disadvantages: Averages over different political eras and dynamics

2. **Recent African coups (2020-present)** (9 successful coups)
   - Advantages: Captures current acceleration; reflects contemporary dynamics
   - Disadvantages: Small sample; excludes Latin America; potentially temporary phenomenon

3. **Recent Latin American coups** (very limited, 2 since 2010)
   - Advantages: Region-specific; contemporary
   - Disadvantages: Too few data points; different dynamics than Africa

**Most suitable reference class**: All coups in Africa and Latin America since 2000, with particular attention to the acceleration since 2020. This provides sufficient data while capturing relevant temporal and regional dynamics.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- Prediction window: April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025 (67 days ≈ 2.2 months)
- Historical rate (2000-2024): 32 coups over 24 years ≈ 1.33 coups/year
- Projected rate for 2.2-month period: 1.33 × (2.2/12) ≈ 0.24 coups
- Recent acceleration (2020-2024): 9 coups in 4 years in Africa ≈ 2.25 coups/year
- Projected recent rate for 2.2-month period: 2.25 × (2.2/12) ≈ 0.41 coups

The short timeframe (67 days) significantly constrains the likelihood compared to annual rates, but the recent acceleration especially in Africa increases the probability compared to the 24-year average.

## (d) Justification

Several factors inform the outside view prediction:

1. **Regional concentration**: The "Sahelian coup belt" (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger) represents a high-risk cluster with continued security challenges, while Guinea, Gabon, Sudan, and Chad remain vulnerable. Latin America shows markedly fewer coups in recent decades.

2. **Acceleration trend**: The sources document a clear surge since 2020, with 9 successful coups in Africa representing a significant increase from the previous decade's average of <1 per year.

3. **Structural drivers remain active**:
   - Ongoing jihadist insurgencies in the Sahel
   - Anti-French sentiment driving military populism
   - Russian influence via Wagner Group
   - Economic stresses (inflation, resource dependence)
   - Weak democratic institutions and legitimacy crises

4. **Contagion effect**: Recent successful coups inspire copycats, especially in neighboring states (demonstrated in the Sahel).

5. **Timeframe constraint**: The relatively short 67-day window limits the probability compared to annual projections.

6. **Country-specific vulnerabilities**: Several countries face imminent risks per expert assessment, with "baseline likelihood exceeding 50%" in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Venezuela by mid-2025.

The integration of these factors suggests a non-trivial probability despite the short timeframe, with significantly higher risk in Africa than Latin America.

## Outside view calibration:

The base rate calculation yields:
- Historical annual rate (2000-2024): 1.33 coups/year
- Recent annual rate in Africa (2020-2024): 2.25 coups/year
- For a 2.2-month window at historical rate: ~24% probability
- For a 2.2-month window at recent rate: ~41% probability

However, several additional factors require adjustment:
1. The recent acceleration appears non-random and tied to specific regional dynamics
2. Expert assessment identifies specific high-risk countries with >50% likelihood by mid-2025
3. The reference to a Bolivia coup attempt in June 2024 suggests Latin American risk may be higher than the historical pattern would indicate
4. The shortness of the timeframe (67 days) significantly constrains the probability

Balancing these factors, I calibrate toward the higher range of the calculated base rates while accounting for the time constraint. The outside view probability falls between the historical average projection (24%) and the recent trend projection (41%).

  b. Georgetown Journal (“Understanding Africa’s Recent Coups,” Apr 2024)  
    • Summary: Nine successful coups in Africa since 2020; drivers (security failures, “anti-autocratic” framing, weak norms); details on Sahelian belt, erosion of AU/ECOWAS deterrence.  
    • Quality: Peer-reviewed journal; author cites Afrobarometer, AU declarations. High credibility.  
    • Factual vs. Opinion: Mix of fact (dates, counts, quoted statistics) and expert interpretation (drivers, normative erosion). Treat expert interpretations as strong signals.  
  c. VOA News (“By the Numbers: Coups in Africa”)  
    • Summary: 220 coup attempts, 109 successes in Africa since 1950; surge since 2021; pre-2021 avg <1 success/year; recent 3-year spike to ~3/year.  
    • Quality: Reputable news agency; sources include Powell & Thyne. Good for trend data.  
    • Factual vs. Opinion: Largely factual. Occasional commentary (e.g., “coup epidemic”) should be weighed against hard counts.  
  d. Listverse (“The 10 Boldest Coup Attempts of the 21st Century,” Jun 2024)  
    • Summary: Selected case studies including Bolivia (2024 attempt), Venezuela (2002), etc.  
    • Quality: Popular media; not peer‐reviewed; prone to sensationalism.  
    • Use: Low weight; useful for anecdotal context, not for baseline frequencies.  
  e. Perplexity Report (aggregated “Coups in Africa and Latin America” since 2000)  
    • Summary: Raw counts (Africa: 26 since 2000; Latin America: 6), drivers, clusters, projected risks.  
    • Quality: Automated aggregate; risk of synthesis errors. Provide plausible detail but must cross-check.  
    • Use: Tentative; extract broad figures but rely on primary sources (VOA, Georgetown) for calibration.

2. Reference‐Class Analysis  
  Potential reference classes:  
    • Global coups since 1945 – too broad (norms vary drastically).  
    • African coups since 2000 (26 successes in 24 yrs, ~1.08/yr).  
    • Latin American coups since 2000 (6 successes in 24 yrs, ~0.25/yr).  
    • Combined Africa + Latin America since 2000 (~1.33 successes/yr).  
  Suitability: Combined regional class since 2000 best matches geographical scope and modern political context.

3. Timeframe Analysis  
  • Forecast horizon: Today is 2025-04-25, question resolves by 2025-07-01 → ~66 days remaining ≈0.18 years.  
  • Historical frequency (2000–2024): ~1.33 successful coups per year across both regions.  
  • Expected coups in 0.18 yr = 1.33 × 0.18 ≈0.24.  
  • Poisson model → P(at least one) = 1 – exp(–0.24) ≈ 21%.

4. Adjustments for Recent Trends  
  • Post-2020 “coup wave” in Africa raised African rate to ~3/yr over 2021–2023; Latin America unchanged (~0.25/yr). → Combined ~3.25/yr → expected in 0.18 yr ≈0.59 → P ≈45%.  
  • 2024 (to date) has seen no coups in either region, suggesting some regression toward long-run mean.  
  • Norms and international responses remain weak in the Sahel, but few immediate flashpoints appear poised for coups in next two months.  
  • Latin America’s “coup season” now rare; none since 2019.

Justification for Outside-View Prediction  
  • Long-run baseline (2000–2024): ~1.33 coups/yr → ~21% chance in 66 days.  
  • Recent elevated risk in Africa pushes that figure upward (max ~45%), but lack of 2024 coups and no obvious hotspots about to tip leans back toward the long-run rate.  
  • Given the short forecast window (~2 months) even elevated annual rates translate into modest absolute probabilities.  
  • Outside view anchors near the long-run reference-class estimate but incorporates some upward tilt for the post-2020 coup wave.

Outside view calibration:  
  – Long-run reference class (2000–2024): 21%  
  – High-wave adjustment upper bound: 45%  
  – Regression on 2024’s calm suggests a pull back toward baseline → mid-point ≈33%  

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 33% probability that at least one successful coup d’état occurs in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025.

    – Factual vs. opinion: Use its raw data tentatively; cross-check counts with academic sources before trusting.  

2. Reference‐class analysis  
  Possible reference classes:  
    1. Successful coups in Africa over post-2000 period.  
    2. Successful coups in Latin America over post-2000 period.  
    3. Combined Africa + Latin America coups.  
    4. Global coups in developing regions.  
  Suitability: Our question covers exactly Africa or Latin America, so class 3 is ideal. Classes 1 and 2 separately are helpful for weights.  

3. Historical base‐rate calculation  
  a. Africa (2000–Oct 2023): 26 successes over ≈23.75 years → 1.09 coups/year.  
  b. Latin America (2000–2024): 6 successes over 25 years → 0.24 coups/year.  
  c. Combined rate ≈1.09 + 0.24 = 1.33 successful coups per year.  

4. Timeframe analysis  
  – Today: April 25, 2025. Deadline: July 1, 2025 → ≈67 days ≈ 0.183 years.  
  – If coups follow a Poisson process with λ = 1.33/year, then expected coups over next 0.183 years is μ = 1.33 × 0.183 ≈ 0.244.  
  – Probability of ≥1 coup = 1 – e^(–0.244) ≈ 0.22 (22%).  

5. Adjustment for recent trends  
  – Recent surge in Africa (nine successes in 4 years since 2020 → 2.25/year) raises short-term risk.  
  – Latin America remains quiescent (no successes since 2019).  
  – Blending long-term base-rate (1.33) and recent elevated African rate (~2.25 + 0.24 = 2.49) gives mid-range 1.9 coups/year → μ=1.9 × 0.183 ≈ 0.35 → p≈1–e^(–0.35)=0.30.  

6. Expert/market expectations  
  – No public betting market on this specific question.  
  – Expert commentary (AU, ECOWAS briefings) warns of persistent Sahel risks but no immediate coup forecasts.  

Justification for outside‐view probability  
  – We anchor on the long-term combined rate (1.33/year) to avoid over-reacting to the recent African wave, but we uplift modestly to reflect weakened regional norms and lingering insecurity.  
  – Poisson calculation over the remaining 67 days yields ≈22% by pure long-run baseline; blending with elevated short-run risk moves us toward ≈30%.  

Outside view calibration:  
  – Base-rate: 1.33 coups/year → 22% over 67 days.  
  – Blended with recent trend uplift → ~30%.  
  – This reflects our best estimate of “true probability,” not an overconfident hedge.  

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 30% chance (±1%) that a successful coup d’état will occur in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:
------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis  
• Cline Center “Frequency of Coup Events 1945-2024” – Primary, peer-reviewed academic dataset; contains hard counts of attempted/successful coups.  High factual reliability, negligible opinion content.  
• Georgetown J. of International Affairs article (Apr 2024) – Scholarly magazine; mixes narrative with data.  Facts on dates/actors credible, evaluative comments (e.g. “erosion of norms”) are opinion.  
• VOA “By the Numbers: Coups in Africa” (2023) – Mainstream news outlet citing Powell & Thyne and Cline Center figures.  Factual statistics sound; ‘coup epidemic’ framing is opinion.  
• Listverse “10 Boldest Coup Attempts” (Jun 2024) – Popular website.  Factual kernels (e.g. June-24 Bolivian attempt) but sensational tone; low weight placed on its judgments.  
• BBC Oscars piece (Mar 2025) – Irrelevant to the coup question.  Ignored.  
• Perplexity synthetic report – Aggregates multiple sources but is not itself primary.  Treat purely as a convenient collation, verifying numbers against the academic/news items above.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes (annualised rates, 2000-2024):  
1. Global coups – ~2.5 successes/yr; too broad (includes Asia, Europe).  
2. Africa + Latin America coups – 32 successes/25 yrs ≈ 1.28/yr (suitable; matches geographical scope).  
3. Africa only – 26/25 yrs ≈ 1.0/yr; reflects the dominant share of risk.  
4. “Post-2020 Africa wave” – 9 successes/4 yrs ≈ 2.25/yr; captures recent up-spike but may over-fit a short period.  
Chosen reference class: #2 (Africa + Latin America, 2000-2024).  It balances recency with a quarter-century of observations and includes both regions in the question.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Today → 1 July 2025 = 67 days = 0.184 years.  
• Expected successes in 0.184 y under chosen rate (λ): 1.28 × 0.184 ≈ 0.24.  
• Assuming a Poisson arrival process, P(at least one coup) = 1 – e^-λ ≈ 1 – e^-0.24 ≈ 0.21 (21%).  

Sensitivity check  
– Using the higher “post-2020” African rate (2.25/yr): λ ≈ 0.41 ⇒ P ≈ 34%.  
– Using the lower Latin-America-only rate (0.24/yr): λ ≈ 0.04 ⇒ P ≈ 4%.  
Weighted blend (90 % weight on Africa rate, 10 % on Latin-America rate) gives ~0.93 /yr ⇒ λ ≈ 0.17 ⇒ P ≈ 16%.  
Because virtually all recent activity is African, and 2024-early-25 has shown a lull, I midpoint the 21 % and 34 % estimates, then shave a few points in recognition of the current 20-month coup-free stretch (mean-reversion effect).  Resulting outside-view band: 24 – 30 %.

(d) Justification  
• Empirical frequency is the anchor; no strong forward-looking information is introduced (that would be “inside view”).  
• Poisson assumption is reasonable for low-probability, irregular events; historically the spacing of coups is over-dispersed but still approximated adequately for a two-month horizon.  
• Africa drives the risk; Latin America contributes little in the 21st century, hence the outside view is dominated by the African rate.  
• Recent acceleration (2020-23) argues for nudging above the long-run mean, yet the absence of a successful coup since Aug 2023 suggests mean-reversion pressure.  Averaging these pulls centres the probability in the high-20s.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor = 21 % (25-year rate).  Recency adjustment (+6 %).  Mean-reversion adjustment (-3 %).  Rounded to the nearest single percentage point for clarity.

Outside View Prediction:
28 %

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **PBS NewsHour on ECOWAS Summit (December 2024)**
   - Recent coverage of Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso's withdrawal from ECOWAS
   - High-quality source with statements from official bodies and expert analysis
   - Key facts: Transition period from January to July 29, 2025 for the three military juntas
   - Expert opinions from Babacar Ndiaye and Mucahid Durmaz warn of ECOWAS fragmentation

2. **Crisis Group's "10 Conflicts to Watch in 2025" (January 2025)**
   - High-quality analysis from respected conflict prevention organization
   - Factual content includes ongoing conflicts in DR Congo, Sudan, and Myanmar
   - Limited specific discussion of coup risks but notes high global conflict levels

3. **Al Jazeera on Mali's Political Unrest (August 2020)**
   - Dated but provides historical context on Mali's 2020 coup
   - Factual reporting on economic hardship, security deterioration, and regional responses
   - Contains expert warnings from ECOWAS about unconstitutional power changes

4. **BBC on Mozambique Election Violence (November 2024)**
   - Recent reporting on post-election violence and border closure with South Africa
   - High-quality factual reporting with statements from officials
   - Notes Defense Minister's warning about potentially deploying the army

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Recent coup patterns: Nine successful coups in Africa since 2020 according to various sources, establishing a clear pattern particularly in the Sahel region
- Institutional weakening: The ECOWAS withdrawal transition period for three military juntas overlaps with our forecast window, reducing constraints against further coups

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Electoral tensions in Mozambique: Significant post-election violence could potentially escalate, though not yet at coup level
- Regional clustering: Historical data shows coups tend to occur in regional clusters and "coup traps" where one coup increases likelihood of others

**Weak Evidence:**
- General global instability mentioned by Crisis Group has limited direct connection to coup probability
- Outdated information on Mali from 2020 has limited predictive value for 2025

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is 67 days (April 25 to July 1, 2025). Based on the identified rate of approximately 2 successful coups per year across both regions since 2020, the baseline expectation for a 67-day period would be approximately 0.37 coups.

If the timeframe were halved (33 days), the probability would decrease to around 20% as there would be less time for political situations to deteriorate and for coup planning to materialize.

If doubled (134 days), the probability would increase to around 50-55%, particularly as it would encompass more of the critical ECOWAS transition period for coup-prone countries.

## (d) Justification

Starting with our outside view baseline of approximately 33% (the probability of at least one coup in a 67-day period given recent rates), I need to adjust based on current evidence:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. The ECOWAS transition period ending July 29, 2025 represents a significant weakening of institutional constraints against coups, especially for Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso. This overlapping with our forecast period is particularly concerning.

2. The current situation in Mozambique shows a pattern of political instability that could potentially escalate, with the Defense Minister already warning about military deployment.

3. The "coup contagion" effect documented in recent African coups suggests successful coups inspire others in neighboring countries.

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. Recent consolidation of power by military juntas in coup-prone countries like Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso suggests reduced likelihood of new coups in those specific countries during our timeframe.

2. The provided information contains limited evidence of imminent coup risks in Latin America, suggesting the probability in that region may be lower than historical averages.

Based on these factors, I estimate a moderate upward adjustment from the baseline probability is warranted.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view baseline of 33% provides a solid starting point based on recent coup frequency in our reference regions.

The institutional weakening factor (ECOWAS transition overlapping with our period) merits a +4% adjustment due to its direct relevance to coup constraints.

The Mozambique situation warrants a +2% adjustment as it represents a specific flashpoint with potential for escalation.

The consolidation of power in recent coup countries suggests a -1% adjustment, as these specific countries may be temporarily less vulnerable to new coups.

The limited evidence for Latin American coup risks suggests a -1% adjustment for that portion of our geographic scope.

Net adjustment: +4%

Final probability: 37%

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will any African or Latin American country experience a successful military or self-coup before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view: 33% based on coup frequency since 2020
3. Consistency: In 37 of 100 identical time periods, we'd expect at least one successful coup in these regions
4. Key evidence: ECOWAS transition weakening constraints; Mozambique political tension; recent consolidation in coup countries; limited Latin American risks
5. Blind spot: Sudden deterioration in currently stable country not mentioned in provided information
6. Status quo: Most countries maintain governance over 67 days, but recent "coup wave" suggests higher volatility than historical norms

Probability: 37%
Predicted Probability: 37.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **ECOWAS Summit Decision (PBS NewsHour, December 2024)**
   - Summarizes ECOWAS approval of withdrawal timeline for Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso (all led by military juntas)
   - High-quality source with factual reporting on institutional decisions
   - Expert opinions from identified analysts (Babacar Ndiaye, Mucahid Durmaz) noting ECOWAS's "inconsistent responses to coups"

2. **10 Conflicts to Watch in 2025 (Crisis Group, January 2025)**
   - Overview of global conflict hotspots for 2025, including ongoing conflicts in Africa
   - High-quality source from respected conflict analysis organization with field expertise
   - Mix of factual reporting and expert analysis on developing security trends

3. **Mali's Political Unrest (Al Jazeera, August 2020)**
   - Details conditions leading to Mali's 2020 coup, including protests against electoral fraud
   - Reliable source but significantly outdated (nearly 5 years old)
   - Primarily historical context with limited relevance to current coup risks

4. **Mozambique Poll Violence (BBC, November 2024)**
   - Reports post-election violence following disputed Mozambique election
   - High-quality, recent reporting from respected news organization
   - Factual reporting on violence (18+ deaths), government threats, and opposition in hiding

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Recent coup trend in West Africa**: Multiple successful coups in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso have established a pattern of military takeovers in the region, with those countries now withdrawing from ECOWAS. Historical data shows coup contagion effects.
- **Post-election crisis in Mozambique**: BBC reports significant violence (18+ deaths) following disputed elections with the ruling party claiming 71% victory. Opposition leader is in hiding, government threatening military deployment. Post-election crises are established precursors to coups.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Weakening of regional anti-coup norms**: ECOWAS's inability to reverse recent coups and the withdrawal of coup-led states reduces institutional constraints against future coups. Analyst Mucahid Durmaz notes "inconsistent responses to coups."
- **Ongoing conflicts in multiple African states**: Crisis Group identifies continuing instability in Sudan, DR Congo, and elsewhere, creating conditions that historically correlate with coup risk.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Historical coup conditions in Mali**: The 2020 information establishes Mali's coup vulnerability but offers little insight into current risks beyond countries already led by coup leaders.
- **Global power dynamics**: Crisis Group's analysis of shifting global power balances has speculative connections to regional coup likelihood.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is approximately 66 days (April 25 - July 1, 2025), which is relatively short for coup prediction. 

If the timeframe were halved (33 days), the probability would decrease substantially (perhaps by 40-50%) as coups typically require time for conditions to mature and triggering events to occur.

If doubled (132 days), the probability would increase but not linearly - perhaps by 70-80% rather than doubling - as longer periods allow more opportunity for coup preconditions to develop and for triggering events to materialize.

The short timeframe significantly constrains the probability despite concerning signals in several countries.

## (d) Justification:

Starting with our 33% outside view base rate, I make the following evidence-based adjustments:

**Upward Adjustments:**
1. **Mozambique's post-election crisis** (+5%): The specific conditions in Mozambique (disputed election results, violent protests, opposition leader in hiding) represent classic pre-coup conditions.
2. **Weakened regional deterrence in West Africa** (+6%): ECOWAS's failure to reverse recent coups and the withdrawal of coup-led countries significantly reduces coup constraints in a historically coup-prone region.
3. **Ongoing regional instability** (+3%): Continuing conflicts and governance challenges in multiple African countries maintain conditions conducive to military intervention.

**Downward Adjustments:**
1. **Short timeframe limitation** (-5%): With only 66 days remaining, there is limited time for coup conditions to develop where they don't already exist.
2. **No reported coup plots or unusual military movements** (-3%): None of the current sources mention specific indications of imminent coup attempts.
3. **Relative stability in Latin America** (-2%): The sources focus almost exclusively on African instability with no significant mention of coup risks in Latin America.

These adjustments produce a net +4% shift from our base rate.

## Probability calibration

The evidence presents a nuanced picture. The Mozambique crisis shows specific warning signs that historically precede coups, and the weakening of ECOWAS as a coup-prevention institution is significant. However, the short 66-day timeframe limits how much these factors can be expected to materialize into an actual successful coup.

While no coups have occurred yet in 2024 (per the available sources), suggesting some regression to a lower rate after the 2021-2023 wave in Africa, the institutional and regional factors that enabled that wave have not fundamentally changed.

Given these considerations, I calibrate my probability to 37%, representing a modest increase from the 33% outside view base rate, balanced by the constraining effect of the short timeframe.

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will a military/state actor successfully overthrow a government in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025? (66 days)
2. Base rate: 33% from historical coup frequencies since 2000, adjusted for recent patterns
3. Consistency: "In 37 of 100 identical scenarios, a successful coup occurs in Africa/Latin America before July 1, 2025." Aligns with evidence.
4. Key evidence: Mozambique's violent post-election crisis; weakening anti-coup norms in West Africa; short 66-day window; no specific coup plots currently reported
5. Blind spot: Underestimating coup risk in countries not featured in provided articles; sudden coup in previously stable country would make forecast look complacent
6. Status quo: No coups reported yet in 2024, suggesting some regression from 2021-2023 elevated rates

Probability: 37%
Predicted Probability: 37.0%

Output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. PBS NewsHour (Dec 15, 2024): Reports on ECOWAS’s decision to grant Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso a “transitional period” ending July 29, 2025. Highly credible journalism; factual reporting on regional bloc politics; minimal opinion.  
2. Crisis Group “10 Conflicts to Watch in 2025” (Jan 1, 2025): Authoritative think-tank forecasting broader conflict trends; expert commentary on geopolitical drivers but only indirect relevance to African/Latin American coups.  
3. Al Jazeera explainer on Mali unrest (Aug 18, 2020): Detailed background on the 2020 coup’s causes (corruption, security failures). Slightly dated but establishes structural drivers; mixes grounded data with expert quotations.  
4. BBC (Nov 6, 2024) on Mozambique poll violence: Reliable news reporting on protest violence and government response. No coup attempt but illustrates regime willingness to deploy military; factual with some quoted opinions.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
• Sahel “coup belt” remains under junta rule with persistent security crises and weak institutions (Al Jazeera; Cline Center data).  
• Contagion effect: recent coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger create regional precedent (VOA; Georgetown).  
Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
• ECOWAS’s wavering sanctions may embolden further putschists in West Africa (PBS).  
• Crisis Group’s note on erosion of US hegemony emboldening leaders to use force.  
Weak evidence (small shifts):  
• Mozambique protest violence shows regime fragility but no coup dynamics.  
• Latin America has seen only sporadic recent coup attempts (Listverse’s note on Bolivia June 2024).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Window: 67 days (Apr 25–Jul 1, 2025).  
• If halved (≈33 days), probability would drop by ~40% of current estimate≈15%.  
• If doubled (≈134 days), probability would rise by ~40%≈35–40%.  
Short horizon suppresses probability relative to annual rates.

(d) Justification / Inside-view adjustments  
1. Short window limits number of opportunities for plotters to organize and seize power.  
2. Most high-risk states (Mali, Burkina, Niger) are already ruled by juntas; internal overthrow would be a self-coup but not “new” under resolution criteria.  
3. No imminent high-stakes elections or mass mutinies known in other African/Latin American states.  
4. Latin America remains relatively coup-free since 2009; recent Bolivia attempt did not succeed.  
5. ECOWAS’s struggle to re-integrate junta states slightly increases risk of copycat coups in neighboring weak states, but major opposition remains.  

Balancing a historical base rate of ~34% and the above dampening factors for such a short period, I move my probability down.

Probability calibration  
Given an outside-view base of ~34%, the short timeframe and lack of clear catalysts warrant a down-adjustment. My inside-view forecast: 25%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will any African or Latin American country experience a successful coup by July 1, 2025?”  
2. Base rate: ~34% per recent historical data (2000–2024) vs. accelerated 2020–24 trend.  
3. Consistency: “In 25 out of 100 similar windows, a new successful coup occurs.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 67-day horizon (short window) – strong limiter  
   • Sahel belt under juntas but no new movers – strong  
   • ECOWAS indecisiveness – moderate risk enhancer  
   • Latin American coup record post-2000 – weak risk  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden insider mutiny in an existing junta that reshapes power (could raise probability).  
6. Status quo: No coups since mid-2024; inertia favors “No.”

Probability: 25%
Predicted Probability: 25.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. University of Illinois Cline Center Coup D’état Project (academic database, covers coups 1945–2024). High quality, factual counts; little opinion.  
2. Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, “Understanding Africa’s Recent Coups” (Apr 2024). Peer-reviewed, mixes data on nine African coups since 2020 and expert interpretation of drivers. Reliable.  
3. VOA “By the Numbers: Coups in Africa” (2024). Reputable broadcaster quoting peer-reviewed studies on 220 attempts, 109 successes. Factual; risk-factor analysis grounded in research.  
4. Listverse “The 10 Boldest Coup Attempts of the 21st Century” (June 2024). Popular site; factual anecdotes but no systematic data. Low weight.  
5. Perplexity aggregated report on coups in Africa & Latin America since 2000. Mixed sourcing; use counts cautiously.  
6. PBS NewsHour (Dec 2024) on ECOWAS exit timeline for Niger, Mali, Burkina. Credible journalism. Provides context on entrenchment of existing juntas.  
7. Crisis Group “10 Conflicts to Watch in 2025” (Jan 2025). Reputable think-tank; highlights high conflict in Sahel, DR Congo, Haiti. Background, not coup-specific.  
8. Al Jazeera explainer on Mali’s 2020 unrest. Solid reporting on grievances that spurred the 2020 coup. Historical context.  
9. BBC (Nov 2024) on Mozambique poll violence. Reliable; violent protests but no coup attempt.  

(b) Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong evidence  
- Recent diffusion of coups in Sahel (“coup belt”): nine successful coups in Africa since 2020 (Georgetown; VOA). Structural erosion of norms.  
- Historical base-rate: 1.33 coups/year combined Africa + Latin America (Cline Center; VOA).  

Moderate evidence  
- ECOWAS fragmentation: withdrawal timetable signals institutional weakness, may lower deterrence of future junta expansions (PBS).  
- Crisis Group’s identification of Sudan, DR Congo, Haiti as flashpoints: indicates regional instability zones where coup risk could materialize.  

Weak evidence  
- Mozambique post-election violence: illustrates protest potential but weak link to military takeover.  
- Listverse anecdotes: colourful but not predictive.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Deadline: July 1, 2025 ≈67 days (0.183 years) from April 25.  
- Halved timeframe (0.091 years): Poisson p≈1−e^(−1.33×0.091)≈11%.  
- Doubled timeframe (0.366 years): p≈1−e^(−1.33×0.366)≈38%.  

(d) Justification for adjusting base rate  
1. Base-rate: 1.33 successful coups/year → 22% over 67 days.  
2. Recent pattern: Africa’s coup rate rose to ≈2.25/year since 2020. Latin America remains low. Blended mid-term rate ≈1.9/year → 30% over 67 days. (Moderate uplift from 22% to 30%.)  
3. ECOWAS weakening and ongoing Sahel insecurity constitute structural factors that sustain coup risk in remaining timeframe.  
4. No strong indications of imminent coups in Latin America; primary driver is Africa.  

Probability calibration  
We anchor on the long-term base-rate but uplift to reflect persistent short-term drivers in Africa’s Sahel region and institutional weakening in ECOWAS. A ~30% estimate balances over-reaction to the recent coup wave against the short time left.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will any African or Latin American country experience a successful coup d’état by July 1, 2025?” (67 days left.)  
2. Base-rate: Combined historical rate ≈1.33 coups/year → 22% over timeframe.  
3. Consistency: “30 out of 100 times, a coup occurs in the region within the next 67 days.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Nine African coups since 2020 (structural erosion).  
   • Poisson base-rate → 22%.  
   • ECOWAS fragmentation weakens deterrence.  
   • Crisis Group flags Sahel, DR Congo instability.  
   • Latin America coup drought keeps overall risk moderate.  
5. Blind-spot: A surprise self-coup in a major Latin American democracy (e.g., Venezuela) could push risk higher; if that seems imminent, probabilities should rise.  
6. Status quo: No new coups have occurred since early 2024; institutions often adapt to survive, suggesting some pull toward “No.”

Output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological):
• Cline Center coup dataset (2024 update) – peer-reviewed, quantitative; separates attempted and successful coups 1945-2024.  Very high factual reliability, zero opinion.  
• Powell & Thyne coup list (2024) – academic, overlaps with Cline; high reliability.  
• PBS/AP on 15 Dec 2024 ECOWAS summit – mainstream, on-the-ground quotes; factual narrative (dates, decisions) strong, commentary by two named analysts (Durmaz, Ndiaye) is opinion.  
• Crisis Group “10 Conflicts to Watch 2025” (1 Jan 2025) – expert NGO; mixes fact and analysis.  Country-specific conflict outlooks are informed but partly speculative.  
• BBC 6 Nov 2024 Mozambique border-violence story – high-quality factual reporting; little opinion, describes security forces’ posture.  

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong  
• Historical base rate: 32 successful coups in Africa+LatAm 2000-24 → 1.28/yr.  (Structural, multidecade dataset.)  
• Post-2020 African spike: 9 coups 2020-23 (2.25/yr) showing recent over-dispersion.  (Multiple independent datasets concur.)  

Moderate  
• Current 20-month lull (no successes since Gabon Aug 2023) suggests mean reversion in the short run.  
• Sahel juntas (Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso) still military-run; intra-junta splits historically raise “coup-within-a-coup” hazard (roughly 1 in 10 per year after seizure – Powell 2022).  
• No Latin-American country exhibits immediate trigger factors (elections, mass barracks unrest) inside next 9 weeks; Bolivia attempt failed Jun 2024.  

Weak  
• Mozambique post-election protests – government still civilian-elected, but violence may embolden army; no credible reporting of coup plotting yet.  
• Speculative link between ECOWAS exit timeline and coup contagion; analysts disagree, causal chain uncertain.

Weighting net effect: strong statistical base rate gives anchor; moderate evidence slightly pulls both up (Sahel risk) and down (recent lull, calm elsewhere), roughly cancelling; weak evidence little effect.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days remaining to 1 Jul 2025: 67 (~0.18 yr).  Halving to 34 days would cut Poisson λ by ~50 %, dropping probability roughly from low-20s to low-teens.  Doubling to 134 days (≈ 0.37 yr) would push probability toward upper-30s.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view anchor (28 %) came from Poisson on 25-year rate, nudged for 2020-23 spike and lull.  
Inside-view factors considered:  
+ Sahel tri-junta historical propensity for counter-coups (adds ~+3 pp)  
– 20-month coup-free stretch and absence of acute triggers in largest states (-5 pp)  
+ Seasonal upticks not apparent; Ramadan over; no major June elections in scope.  
Net adjustment: ‑2 pp from anchor.  Small shift because no single factor is both imminent and high-leverage during a very short horizon.

Probability calibration
Final estimate: I judge that about 23 out of 100 comparable 67-day windows would historically end with ≥1 successful coup given today’s regional climate.

Checklist:
1.  <30 words: “Will any successful coup occur in Africa or Latin-America before 1 Jul 2025?”  
2.  Base rate 28 %; final still rooted to it.  
3.  “23 of 100 times, a successful coup happens.” – consistent with arguments.  
4.  Key evidence: (i) 1.28 coups/yr long-run; (ii) Sahel juntas internally unstable; (iii) 20-month lull; (iv) no looming election flashpoints; (v) recent ECOWAS diplomacy lowers external pressure.  
5.  Blind spot: Sudden palace putsch in Sudan war zone classified as “successful coup” could spike probability.  
6.  Status-quo = no coup; short horizon favours slight nudge toward it, hence downward adjustment.

Probability: 23%

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The prediction window is 67 days (April 25 to July 1, 2025). Based on the identified rate of approximately 2 successful coups per year across both regions since 2020, the baseline expectation for a 67-day period would be approximately 0.37 coups.

If the timeframe were halved (33 days), the probability would decrease to around 20% as there would be less time for political situations to deteriorate and for coup planning to materialize.

If doubled (134 days), the probability would increase to around 50-55%, particularly as it would encompass more of the critical ECOWAS transition period for coup-prone countries.

## (d) Justification

Starting with our outside view baseline of approximately 33% (the probability of at least one coup in a 67-day period given recent rates), I need to adjust based on current evidence:

**Factors increasing probability:**
1. The ECOWAS transition period ending July 29, 2025 represents a significant weakening of institutional constraints against coups, especially for Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso. This overlapping with our forecast period is particularly concerning.

2. The current situation in Mozambique shows a pattern of political instability that could potentially escalate, with the Defense Minister already warning about military deployment.

3. The "coup contagion" effect documented in recent African coups suggests successful coups inspire others in neighboring countries.

**Factors decreasing probability:**
1. Recent consolidation of power by military juntas in coup-prone countries like Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso suggests reduced likelihood of new coups in those specific countries during our timeframe.

2. The provided information contains limited evidence of imminent coup risks in Latin America, suggesting the probability in that region may be lower than historical averages.

Based on these factors, I estimate a moderate upward adjustment from the baseline probability is warranted.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view baseline of 33% provides a solid starting point based on recent coup frequency in our reference regions.

The institutional weakening factor (ECOWAS transition overlapping with our period) merits a +4% adjustment due to its direct relevance to coup constraints.

The Mozambique situation warrants a +2% adjustment as it represents a specific flashpoint with potential for escalation.

The consolidation of power in recent coup countries suggests a -1% adjustment, as these specific countries may be temporarily less vulnerable to new coups.

The limited evidence for Latin American coup risks suggests a -1% adjustment for that portion of our geographic scope.

Net adjustment: +4%

Final probability: 37%

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will any African or Latin American country experience a successful military or self-coup before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view: 33% based on coup frequency since 2020
3. Consistency: In 37 of 100 identical time periods, we'd expect at least one successful coup in these regions
4. Key evidence: ECOWAS transition weakening constraints; Mozambique political tension; recent consolidation in coup countries; limited Latin American risks
5. Blind spot: Sudden deterioration in currently stable country not mentioned in provided information
6. Status quo: Most countries maintain governance over 67 days, but recent "coup wave" suggests higher volatility than historical norms

Probability: 37%
Predicted Probability: 37.0%

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis:

1. **ECOWAS Summit Decision (PBS NewsHour, December 2024)**
   - Summarizes ECOWAS approval of withdrawal timeline for Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso (all led by military juntas)
   - High-quality source with factual reporting on institutional decisions
   - Expert opinions from identified analysts (Babacar Ndiaye, Mucahid Durmaz) noting ECOWAS's "inconsistent responses to coups"

2. **10 Conflicts to Watch in 2025 (Crisis Group, January 2025)**
   - Overview of global conflict hotspots for 2025, including ongoing conflicts in Africa
   - High-quality source from respected conflict analysis organization with field expertise
   - Mix of factual reporting and expert analysis on developing security trends

3. **Mali's Political Unrest (Al Jazeera, August 2020)**
   - Details conditions leading to Mali's 2020 coup, including protests against electoral fraud
   - Reliable source but significantly outdated (nearly 5 years old)
   - Primarily historical context with limited relevance to current coup risks

4. **Mozambique Poll Violence (BBC, November 2024)**
   - Reports post-election violence following disputed Mozambique election
   - High-quality, recent reporting from respected news organization
   - Factual reporting on violence (18+ deaths), government threats, and opposition in hiding

## (b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Recent coup trend in West Africa**: Multiple successful coups in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso have established a pattern of military takeovers in the region, with those countries now withdrawing from ECOWAS. Historical data shows coup contagion effects.
- **Post-election crisis in Mozambique**: BBC reports significant violence (18+ deaths) following disputed elections with the ruling party claiming 71% victory. Opposition leader is in hiding, government threatening military deployment. Post-election crises are established precursors to coups.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Weakening of regional anti-coup norms**: ECOWAS's inability to reverse recent coups and the withdrawal of coup-led states reduces institutional constraints against future coups. Analyst Mucahid Durmaz notes "inconsistent responses to coups."
- **Ongoing conflicts in multiple African states**: Crisis Group identifies continuing instability in Sudan, DR Congo, and elsewhere, creating conditions that historically correlate with coup risk.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Historical coup conditions in Mali**: The 2020 information establishes Mali's coup vulnerability but offers little insight into current risks beyond countries already led by coup leaders.
- **Global power dynamics**: Crisis Group's analysis of shifting global power balances has speculative connections to regional coup likelihood.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis:

The prediction window is approximately 66 days (April 25 - July 1, 2025), which is relatively short for coup prediction. 

If the timeframe were halved (33 days), the probability would decrease substantially (perhaps by 40-50%) as coups typically require time for conditions to mature and triggering events to occur.

If doubled (132 days), the probability would increase but not linearly - perhaps by 70-80% rather than doubling - as longer periods allow more opportunity for coup preconditions to develop and for triggering events to materialize.

The short timeframe significantly constrains the probability despite concerning signals in several countries.

## (d) Justification:

Starting with our 33% outside view base rate, I make the following evidence-based adjustments:

**Upward Adjustments:**
1. **Mozambique's post-election crisis** (+5%): The specific conditions in Mozambique (disputed election results, violent protests, opposition leader in hiding) represent classic pre-coup conditions.
2. **Weakened regional deterrence in West Africa** (+6%): ECOWAS's failure to reverse recent coups and the withdrawal of coup-led countries significantly reduces coup constraints in a historically coup-prone region.
3. **Ongoing regional instability** (+3%): Continuing conflicts and governance challenges in multiple African countries maintain conditions conducive to military intervention.

**Downward Adjustments:**
1. **Short timeframe limitation** (-5%): With only 66 days remaining, there is limited time for coup conditions to develop where they don't already exist.
2. **No reported coup plots or unusual military movements** (-3%): None of the current sources mention specific indications of imminent coup attempts.
3. **Relative stability in Latin America** (-2%): The sources focus almost exclusively on African instability with no significant mention of coup risks in Latin America.

These adjustments produce a net +4% shift from our base rate.

## Probability calibration

The evidence presents a nuanced picture. The Mozambique crisis shows specific warning signs that historically precede coups, and the weakening of ECOWAS as a coup-prevention institution is significant. However, the short 66-day timeframe limits how much these factors can be expected to materialize into an actual successful coup.

While no coups have occurred yet in 2024 (per the available sources), suggesting some regression to a lower rate after the 2021-2023 wave in Africa, the institutional and regional factors that enabled that wave have not fundamentally changed.

Given these considerations, I calibrate my probability to 37%, representing a modest increase from the 33% outside view base rate, balanced by the constraining effect of the short timeframe.

## Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will a military/state actor successfully overthrow a government in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025? (66 days)
2. Base rate: 33% from historical coup frequencies since 2000, adjusted for recent patterns
3. Consistency: "In 37 of 100 identical scenarios, a successful coup occurs in Africa/Latin America before July 1, 2025." Aligns with evidence.
4. Key evidence: Mozambique's violent post-election crisis; weakening anti-coup norms in West Africa; short 66-day window; no specific coup plots currently reported
5. Blind spot: Underestimating coup risk in countries not featured in provided articles; sudden coup in previously stable country would make forecast look complacent
6. Status quo: No coups reported yet in 2024, suggesting some regression from 2021-2023 elevated rates

Probability: 37%
Predicted Probability: 37.0%

Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. PBS NewsHour (Dec 15, 2024): Reports on ECOWAS’s decision to grant Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso a “transitional period” ending July 29, 2025. Highly credible journalism; factual reporting on regional bloc politics; minimal opinion.  
2. Crisis Group “10 Conflicts to Watch in 2025” (Jan 1, 2025): Authoritative think-tank forecasting broader conflict trends; expert commentary on geopolitical drivers but only indirect relevance to African/Latin American coups.  
3. Al Jazeera explainer on Mali unrest (Aug 18, 2020): Detailed background on the 2020 coup’s causes (corruption, security failures). Slightly dated but establishes structural drivers; mixes grounded data with expert quotations.  
4. BBC (Nov 6, 2024) on Mozambique poll violence: Reliable news reporting on protest violence and government response. No coup attempt but illustrates regime willingness to deploy military; factual with some quoted opinions.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
• Sahel “coup belt” remains under junta rule with persistent security crises and weak institutions (Al Jazeera; Cline Center data).  
• Contagion effect: recent coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger create regional precedent (VOA; Georgetown).  
Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
• ECOWAS’s wavering sanctions may embolden further putschists in West Africa (PBS).  
• Crisis Group’s note on erosion of US hegemony emboldening leaders to use force.  
Weak evidence (small shifts):  
• Mozambique protest violence shows regime fragility but no coup dynamics.  
• Latin America has seen only sporadic recent coup attempts (Listverse’s note on Bolivia June 2024).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Window: 67 days (Apr 25–Jul 1, 2025).  
• If halved (≈33 days), probability would drop by ~40% of current estimate≈15%.  
• If doubled (≈134 days), probability would rise by ~40%≈35–40%.  
Short horizon suppresses probability relative to annual rates.

(d) Justification / Inside-view adjustments  
1. Short window limits number of opportunities for plotters to organize and seize power.  
2. Most high-risk states (Mali, Burkina, Niger) are already ruled by juntas; internal overthrow would be a self-coup but not “new” under resolution criteria.  
3. No imminent high-stakes elections or mass mutinies known in other African/Latin American states.  
4. Latin America remains relatively coup-free since 2009; recent Bolivia attempt did not succeed.  
5. ECOWAS’s struggle to re-integrate junta states slightly increases risk of copycat coups in neighboring weak states, but major opposition remains.  

Balancing a historical base rate of ~34% and the above dampening factors for such a short period, I move my probability down.

Probability calibration  
Given an outside-view base of ~34%, the short timeframe and lack of clear catalysts warrant a down-adjustment. My inside-view forecast: 25%.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will any African or Latin American country experience a successful coup by July 1, 2025?”  
2. Base rate: ~34% per recent historical data (2000–2024) vs. accelerated 2020–24 trend.  
3. Consistency: “In 25 out of 100 similar windows, a new successful coup occurs.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 67-day horizon (short window) – strong limiter  
   • Sahel belt under juntas but no new movers – strong  
   • ECOWAS indecisiveness – moderate risk enhancer  
   • Latin American coup record post-2000 – weak risk  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden insider mutiny in an existing junta that reshapes power (could raise probability).  
6. Status quo: No coups since mid-2024; inertia favors “No.”

Probability: 25%
Predicted Probability: 25.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. University of Illinois Cline Center Coup D’état Project (academic database, covers coups 1945–2024). High quality, factual counts; little opinion.  
2. Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, “Understanding Africa’s Recent Coups” (Apr 2024). Peer-reviewed, mixes data on nine African coups since 2020 and expert interpretation of drivers. Reliable.  
3. VOA “By the Numbers: Coups in Africa” (2024). Reputable broadcaster quoting peer-reviewed studies on 220 attempts, 109 successes. Factual; risk-factor analysis grounded in research.  
4. Listverse “The 10 Boldest Coup Attempts of the 21st Century” (June 2024). Popular site; factual anecdotes but no systematic data. Low weight.  
5. Perplexity aggregated report on coups in Africa & Latin America since 2000. Mixed sourcing; use counts cautiously.  
6. PBS NewsHour (Dec 2024) on ECOWAS exit timeline for Niger, Mali, Burkina. Credible journalism. Provides context on entrenchment of existing juntas.  
7. Crisis Group “10 Conflicts to Watch in 2025” (Jan 2025). Reputable think-tank; highlights high conflict in Sahel, DR Congo, Haiti. Background, not coup-specific.  
8. Al Jazeera explainer on Mali’s 2020 unrest. Solid reporting on grievances that spurred the 2020 coup. Historical context.  
9. BBC (Nov 2024) on Mozambique poll violence. Reliable; violent protests but no coup attempt.  

(b) Evidence analysis (weighting)  
Strong evidence  
- Recent diffusion of coups in Sahel (“coup belt”): nine successful coups in Africa since 2020 (Georgetown; VOA). Structural erosion of norms.  
- Historical base-rate: 1.33 coups/year combined Africa + Latin America (Cline Center; VOA).  

Moderate evidence  
- ECOWAS fragmentation: withdrawal timetable signals institutional weakness, may lower deterrence of future junta expansions (PBS).  
- Crisis Group’s identification of Sudan, DR Congo, Haiti as flashpoints: indicates regional instability zones where coup risk could materialize.  

Weak evidence  
- Mozambique post-election violence: illustrates protest potential but weak link to military takeover.  
- Listverse anecdotes: colourful but not predictive.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Deadline: July 1, 2025 ≈67 days (0.183 years) from April 25.  
- Halved timeframe (0.091 years): Poisson p≈1−e^(−1.33×0.091)≈11%.  
- Doubled timeframe (0.366 years): p≈1−e^(−1.33×0.366)≈38%.  

(d) Justification for adjusting base rate  
1. Base-rate: 1.33 successful coups/year → 22% over 67 days.  
2. Recent pattern: Africa’s coup rate rose to ≈2.25/year since 2020. Latin America remains low. Blended mid-term rate ≈1.9/year → 30% over 67 days. (Moderate uplift from 22% to 30%.)  
3. ECOWAS weakening and ongoing Sahel insecurity constitute structural factors that sustain coup risk in remaining timeframe.  
4. No strong indications of imminent coups in Latin America; primary driver is Africa.  

Probability calibration  
We anchor on the long-term base-rate but uplift to reflect persistent short-term drivers in Africa’s Sahel region and institutional weakening in ECOWAS. A ~30% estimate balances over-reaction to the recent coup wave against the short time left.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will any African or Latin American country experience a successful coup d’état by July 1, 2025?” (67 days left.)  
2. Base-rate: Combined historical rate ≈1.33 coups/year → 22% over timeframe.  
3. Consistency: “30 out of 100 times, a coup occurs in the region within the next 67 days.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Nine African coups since 2020 (structural erosion).  
   • Poisson base-rate → 22%.  
   • ECOWAS fragmentation weakens deterrence.  
   • Crisis Group flags Sahel, DR Congo instability.  
   • Latin America coup drought keeps overall risk moderate.  
5. Blind-spot: A surprise self-coup in a major Latin American democracy (e.g., Venezuela) could push risk higher; if that seems imminent, probabilities should rise.  
6. Status quo: No new coups have occurred since early 2024; institutions often adapt to survive, suggesting some pull toward “No.”

Output:
Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological):
• Cline Center coup dataset (2024 update) – peer-reviewed, quantitative; separates attempted and successful coups 1945-2024.  Very high factual reliability, zero opinion.  
• Powell & Thyne coup list (2024) – academic, overlaps with Cline; high reliability.  
• PBS/AP on 15 Dec 2024 ECOWAS summit – mainstream, on-the-ground quotes; factual narrative (dates, decisions) strong, commentary by two named analysts (Durmaz, Ndiaye) is opinion.  
• Crisis Group “10 Conflicts to Watch 2025” (1 Jan 2025) – expert NGO; mixes fact and analysis.  Country-specific conflict outlooks are informed but partly speculative.  
• BBC 6 Nov 2024 Mozambique border-violence story – high-quality factual reporting; little opinion, describes security forces’ posture.  

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong  
• Historical base rate: 32 successful coups in Africa+LatAm 2000-24 → 1.28/yr.  (Structural, multidecade dataset.)  
• Post-2020 African spike: 9 coups 2020-23 (2.25/yr) showing recent over-dispersion.  (Multiple independent datasets concur.)  

Moderate  
• Current 20-month lull (no successes since Gabon Aug 2023) suggests mean reversion in the short run.  
• Sahel juntas (Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso) still military-run; intra-junta splits historically raise “coup-within-a-coup” hazard (roughly 1 in 10 per year after seizure – Powell 2022).  
• No Latin-American country exhibits immediate trigger factors (elections, mass barracks unrest) inside next 9 weeks; Bolivia attempt failed Jun 2024.  

Weak  
• Mozambique post-election protests – government still civilian-elected, but violence may embolden army; no credible reporting of coup plotting yet.  
• Speculative link between ECOWAS exit timeline and coup contagion; analysts disagree, causal chain uncertain.

Weighting net effect: strong statistical base rate gives anchor; moderate evidence slightly pulls both up (Sahel risk) and down (recent lull, calm elsewhere), roughly cancelling; weak evidence little effect.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days remaining to 1 Jul 2025: 67 (~0.18 yr).  Halving to 34 days would cut Poisson λ by ~50 %, dropping probability roughly from low-20s to low-teens.  Doubling to 134 days (≈ 0.37 yr) would push probability toward upper-30s.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view anchor (28 %) came from Poisson on 25-year rate, nudged for 2020-23 spike and lull.  
Inside-view factors considered:  
+ Sahel tri-junta historical propensity for counter-coups (adds ~+3 pp)  
– 20-month coup-free stretch and absence of acute triggers in largest states (-5 pp)  
+ Seasonal upticks not apparent; Ramadan over; no major June elections in scope.  
Net adjustment: ‑2 pp from anchor.  Small shift because no single factor is both imminent and high-leverage during a very short horizon.

Probability calibration
Final estimate: I judge that about 23 out of 100 comparable 67-day windows would historically end with ≥1 successful coup given today’s regional climate.

Checklist:
1.  <30 words: “Will any successful coup occur in Africa or Latin-America before 1 Jul 2025?”  
2.  Base rate 28 %; final still rooted to it.  
3.  “23 of 100 times, a successful coup happens.” – consistent with arguments.  
4.  Key evidence: (i) 1.28 coups/yr long-run; (ii) Sahel juntas internally unstable; (iii) 20-month lull; (iv) no looming election flashpoints; (v) recent ECOWAS diplomacy lowers external pressure.  
5.  Blind spot: Sudden palace putsch in Sudan war zone classified as “successful coup” could spike probability.  
6.  Status-quo = no coup; short horizon favours slight nudge toward it, hence downward adjustment.

Probability: 23%
Predicted Probability: 23.0%...
