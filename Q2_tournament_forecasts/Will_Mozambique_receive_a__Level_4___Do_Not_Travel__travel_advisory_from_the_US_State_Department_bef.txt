Analysis:
This question hinges on understanding how and why the US State Department moves a country to its highest “Level 4 – Do Not Travel” advisory, and whether Mozambique’s ongoing protests or other risk factors mirror past triggers. To form an out-view, I need data on (a) how often the State Department has issued Level 4 advisories in the past five years, (b) the main drivers behind those advisories (e.g., violent unrest, terrorism, natural disasters, health crises), and (c) Mozambique’s own advisory history and any recent upticks in risk (especially protests or security incidents). Key historical context includes past advisory changes for Mozambique and comparable countries in southern/central Africa, criteria the State Department cites for Level 4, and patterns in timing (e.g., how quickly advisories rose after major events).

Current context LLM output:
Analysis:
Mozambique currently faces security challenges from an Islamist insurgency in the northern Cabo Delgado region, recurring protests over wages and services, and periodic natural disasters (cyclones and flooding). The US State Department’s travel advisory level hinges on risks such as terrorism, kidnapping, violent crime, civil unrest, and health emergencies. To assess whether a Level 4 travel advisory (“Do Not Travel”) is likely before July 1, 2025, I need up-to-date information on:
- Recent terrorist or insurgent attacks, especially targeting foreigners or occurring near tourist zones.
- Escalation in protest activity or violent clashes with security forces.
- Kidnappings or hostage incidents involving international nationals.
- Statements or press releases from the US State Department or the US Embassy in Mozambique indicating risk upgrades.
- Any new health threats or natural disaster aftermath affecting traveler safety.

<Summary source="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/travel/foreign-office-travel-warning-30717146">
Article: Fiona Callingham, Liverpool Echo, Jan 6 2025

Key facts and figures  
• On Dec 30, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) upgraded its advice to “against all but essential travel” for all of Mozambique and “against all travel” to parts of the country.  
• In December, some 1,500 inmates escaped from a Mozambican prison; security forces reported 33 fatalities and 15 injuries during clashes with guards. Police chief Bernardino Rafael said roughly 150 escapees have since been recaptured.  
• Mozambique’s Supreme Court upheld the ruling Frelimo party’s victory in the recent presidential election, sparking widespread demonstrations from Monday onward.

Named‐source warnings and guidance  
• FCDO (Dec 30): “There is significant unrest across Mozambique which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Protests can be violent and occur at short notice. Police have used live ammunition, leading to civilians being killed and injured. There are increased incidents of criminality including looting, break-ins, and robberies.”  
• FCDO advises travellers to seek local advice, avoid large gatherings, avoid travel after dark, and monitor local media. It warns that roads, airport access and border crossings can be “restricted, blocked or closed” at short notice.  
• The FCDO specifically warns against travel to districts in Cabo Delgado Province due to Islamist-linked insurgent attacks, and cautions about “unpredictable violence” near the Lebombo/Ressano Garcia border with South Africa.

Potential travel disruptions  
• Unexpected border closures, delays or route restrictions may affect movements between Mozambique and neighbouring South Africa.  
• Travel insurance may be invalidated if FCDO advice is ignored; travellers are urged to review the latest guidance before travelling.

  – The Lebombo port of entry (Mpumalanga) was temporarily closed. A vehicle was torched at the Mozambican side of the border.  
  – South Africa’s Border Management Authority head Michael Masiapato said police and border officials remain on high alert. He ordered Public Order Policing to “make sure there is no public disorder” among Mozambicans waiting to return home.  
• Mozambican authorities’ timeline:  
  – Protesters have indicated a seven-day duration, making Thursday the planned final day.  
  – Masiapato warned they intend to “fully amplify day seven,” including marching on the state house.

<Summary source="https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/advisory-issued-for-holiday-makers-intending-to-travel-to-mozambique/">
The SABC article (2 Dec 2024) reports that the Southern Africa Tourism Services Association (SATSA) has issued an advisory to South African holiday-makers bound for Mozambique, warning them to stay in close contact with their local tourism service providers amid a fresh round of anti-government protests. Key points:

• Issuer: SATSA, chaired by Oupa Pilane  
• Timing: ahead of the busy festive season, as travel to Mozambique ramps up  
• Main concern: protests have flared around certain border posts—particularly the Komati Poort–Lebombo gate—potentially disrupting entries  
• Other crossings (via eSwatini/Swaziland and Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal) remain quiet and unaffected  
• Affected areas: limited to protest zones; popular holiday spots such as Vilankulo and Ponta do Ouro are not experiencing unrest and are deemed safe to visit  
• Recommendation: tourists should monitor developments and rely on their on-the-ground service providers for the latest, location-specific advice

# Comprehensive Analysis of U.S. Department of State Level 4 Travel Advisories (2020–2025)

The U.S. Department of State’s Level 4 travel advisories represent the highest risk designation, warning travelers of life-threatening dangers. This report synthesizes all Level 4 advisories issued since 2020, analyzes their triggers, and evaluates their frequency and implications. Data is drawn from official State Department publications, academic evaluations, and media reports[1][2][3][4][5][6].

## Common Triggers for Level 4 Designations

### 1. **Armed Conflict**
Countries like Ukraine, Sudan, and Syria were designated due to active war zones[3][5][7]. For example, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 escalated regional risks, prompting a Level 4 advisory[3][5].

### 2. **Terrorism**
Nations such as Afghanistan, Somalia, and Iraq face persistent threats from groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab[1][5][7].

### 3. **Political Instability**
Myanmar’s military coup (2021) and Venezuela’s economic collapse led to systemic violence and governance failures[1][3][5].

### 4. **Kidnapping and Crime**
Haiti’s advisory highlights gang-controlled areas where kidnappings target foreigners[1][7].

### 5. **Health Crises**
The 2020 global advisory responded to COVID-19, while localized outbreaks (e.g., Ebola in Congo) have triggered temporary warnings[9][11][12].

### 6. **Natural Disasters**
While less common, events like Haiti’s 2021 earthquake exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, though these often result in Level 2–3 advisories[5][6].

---

## Frequency and Duration

### 1. **Pandemic-Related Advisories**
The global Level 4 advisory (March–August 2020) was the shortest-lived, while country-specific designations often persist for years. For example, Afghanistan has remained at Level 4 since 2021[1][3][7].

### 2. **Regional Trends**
- **Middle East/North Africa**: 40% of Level 4 countries (Syria, Iraq, Yemen)[1][3].
- **Sub-Saharan Africa**: 30% (Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic)[1][5].
- **Europe/Eurasia**: 15% (Ukraine, Belarus, Russia)[1][3].

### 3. **Review Cycles**
Per State Department policy, Level 4 advisories are reassessed every six months[10]. However, conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan have maintained their statuses through multiple review cycles[1][10].

---

## Conclusion

Level 4 advisories reflect grave risks tied to geopolitical instability, violence, and systemic failures. While the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a unique global response, most designations focus on protracted conflicts or authoritarian regimes. Travelers must heed these warnings, as the U.S. government’s ability to assist in such regions is severely limited[2][4][6]. Future advisories will likely continue to prioritize conflict zones and states with collapsing governance structures.</Perplexity_report>

<Summary source="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/world/africa/mozambique-protest-song-azagaia.html">
Here is a focused summary of the January 2, 2025 New York Times article by John Eligon (Johannesburg bureau chief).  

• Context & scale of unrest  
  – Tens of thousands of Mozambicans have taken to the streets since late 2024 to contest a presidential vote they view as rigged.  
  – Daniel Chapo, the long-ruling Frelimo party’s candidate, was declared winner with 65% of the vote; protesters have rallied behind opposition candidate Venâncio Mondlane.  
  – Demonstrations have sometimes turned chaotic, with looting, vandalism and burning tires; clashes between security forces and protesters have left more than 250 reported dead.  

• “Povo no Poder” as anthem  
  – “Povo no Poder” (“People in Power”), a 2008 rap ballad by the late Azagaia (Edson Amândio Maria Lopes da Luz), has become the unofficial anthem of the current uprising.  
  – Young men in Marracuene (about an hour from Maputo) wear T-shirts bearing the song’s refrain and gather around parked cars to bob to its beat.  
  – Activists say its chorus and themes have galvanized protesters, who chant it at marches, on placards and in social media.  

• Azagaia’s background and legacy  
  – Azagaia, who died in 2023 at age 38 following an epileptic seizure, was known for bluntly criticizing the government—lyrics that drew state censorship.  
  – Rights activist Cídia Chissungo, 28, who helped organize early marches, says youth anger over the crushing of a memorial procession for Azagaia partly fueled today’s protests.  
  – His songs laid out many of the movement’s grievances:  
     • “The March” decries political elites’ neglect of the poor.  
     • “Woe to Us” lambasts government inaction in Cabo Delgado, where an IS-linked insurgency has raged.  
     • “Sell the Country” attacks deals with oil and gas interests.  

• A prescient refrain  
  – In “Povo no Poder” Azagaia raps (in Portuguese):  
       “This government really won’t change, no  
        There will be a tragedy, yes  
        Even if they come with tear gas  
        The strike is full of oxygen  
        They won’t stop our performance  
        I will fight, I won’t abstain.”

<Summary source="https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/world-news/sadc-urged-to-deploy-envoy-to-mozambique-amid-fresh-protests/">
Here are the key points from the November 14, 2024 Zimbabwe Mail article “SADC urged to deploy envoy to Mozambique amid fresh protests”:

Facts and statistics  
• Protests in Mozambique have resulted in at least 30 deaths.  
• Demonstrations began peacefully but escalated into violent clashes with security forces.  
• Grievances driving the protests: economic hardship, perceived government corruption, and political exclusion.  
• Urban areas have seen widespread disruptions to daily life.  
• South Africa’s Border Management Authority issued an advisory against travel to Mozambique, specifically warning about the Lebombo Border Post.  
• Regional trade and cross-border investments are already being affected; potential for slower movement of goods and shortages.  
• A humanitarian crisis is unfolding: reports of injuries, mass arrests, displacement, and strained infrastructure complicate aid delivery.  
• SADC Heads of State Summit set for November 16–20, 2024, in Harare.

Opinions from named, (relatively) reliable sources  
• Adriano Nuvunga (Director, Centre for Democracy and Human Rights):  
  – Urges SADC to send a special envoy to Mozambique before the Harare summit to gather firsthand information and conduct inclusive consultations.  
  – Warns that relying solely on government-provided information is insufficient for crafting an effective regional response.  
• Professor Peter Baur (Economist):  
  – Warns that disruptions at key crossings like Lebombo could raise trade costs, slow goods movement, and create shortages in Mozambique and neighboring countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Eswatini).  
  – Suggests that prolonged instability could undermine confidence in Mozambique as a trade partner.

Potentially useful opinions from less-reliable or unnamed voices  
• Human rights and civil-society advocates (unnamed):  
  – Call for SADC to balance immediate peacekeeping with long-term support for democratic reforms to address root causes of the unrest.  
  – Propose creating a joint regional fund to aid Mozambique’s recovery once stability returns.

Context and implications  
• SADC has prior peacekeeping experience in Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado insurgency, but the current mass protests present a different, predominantly political-civil challenge.  
• A pre-summit envoy mission could inform the Harare discussions and underpin both immediate and structural responses aimed at restoring peace and addressing governance grievances.  
• The ongoing crisis poses risks beyond Mozambique’s borders—insecurity, economic spillovers, and humanitarian strain threaten regional stability.

Query: What recent events in Mozambique—like protests, insurgencies, or diplomatic stances—could influence a US Level 4 travel advisory?
Here are the relevant news articles:

**Canada Updates Travel Advisories for Popular Destinations**
The Canadian government has updated its travel advisories for several popular destinations. Travelers are advised to exercise extreme caution due to high terrorist threats in France, where the country is at level 3 on the Vigipirate plan. Crowds can be dangerous, with frequent pickpocketing and targeting of tourists. Additionally, travelers should be wary of taxi scams and violent crimes, which are relatively rare but can occur. Travelers to Spain are also advised to be cautious due to high terrorist threats. In Spain, tourists should be vigilant in large gatherings, where thieves are common. The Canadian government warns that 'people posing as police officers in civilian clothes may ask to see your passport, ID, or wallet.' Travelers to Mexico are advised to exercise caution due to high crime rates and kidnapping risks. Several regional warnings are in effect, advising against non-essential travel to Chiapas, Colima, and the Lagunas de Zempoala national park in Morelos. In the state of Baja California Sur, the security situation has deteriorated since April 22, 2025, due to gunfights, arson, aggression, and theft. Travelers to Costa Rica are advised to exercise extreme caution due to high crime rates. Minor crimes, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, are common, and tourists are often targeted. The advisory has been updated to include home burglaries and car thefts. Violent crimes also occur in Costa Rica, where drug trafficking is common. Women traveling alone should be particularly vigilant, as they may be targeted. The Canadian government advises travelers to exercise caution in Chile due to ongoing protests and civil unrest. Even peaceful protests can turn violent. The advisory has been updated to remove information about a tsunami alert. Minor crimes can occur, but travelers should be particularly vigilant in large cities like Santiago, Calama, and San Pedro d'Atacama. Armed robberies have increased in recent years. Argentina is generally safe, but the Buenos Aires metropolitan area and the Rosario region require extreme caution. A recent earthquake occurred on May 2 in the south of Ushuaia, and travelers should be cautious during visits. Crowds can be dangerous in Argentina, with frequent pickpocketing and targeting of tourists. Violent clashes between gangs are common in vulnerable neighborhoods, where police presence is low.

**U.S. Issues New Travel Warning for 2 Countries**
The United States has issued a new travel warning for two countries: Paraguay and Indonesia. For Paraguay, a Level 1 alert is in effect, advising travelers to 'exercise normal precautions' due to an increased crime risk in certain areas. A Level 2 warning is issued for these areas, where criminal groups are active and smuggling goods along the border with Brazil. In Indonesia, a Level 2 warning is also in effect due to threats of terrorism and natural disasters, while a Level 4 warning is issued for certain provinces due to civil unrest. According to the U.S. government, 'terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting police stations, places of worship, and other locations.' Additionally, natural disasters and demonstrations can also pose a risk to travelers.

**British Government Warns Against Travel to Mozambique's Niassa Province**
The British government's Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has advised against non-essential travel to the districts of Mecula and Marrupo in the province of Niassa, Mozambique, due to attacks by groups linked to Islamic extremism. According to the FCDO, 'all travel, except essential travel, is advised against for the districts of Mecula and Marrupo in the province of Niassa due to attacks by groups with links to Islamic extremism.' The Mozambican police are investigating a suspected new attack by insurgent groups on a hunting reserve in the Reserva Especial do Niassa, which borders Cabo Delgado province. The reserve has been the site of two alleged terrorist movements in recent weeks, with the first reported on April 24. Local reports indicate that the group, whose number is still unknown, entered a village in the reserve, causing panic among residents. The Mozambican Defense Minister, Cristóvão Chume, acknowledged the existence of terrorist groups in the reserve, saying 'we know they are terrorists and we are after them.' The US government has also warned of terrorist movements in the Reserva Especial do Niassa, advising its citizens to reconsider travel to the region. 'The US Government has received information that terrorists attacked villages on the borders of the Reserva Especial do Niassa, before entering the reserve and taking hostages in a private hunting lodge. Mozambican security forces are engaged. Be aware of the increase in violence in the southeastern and eastern borders of the Reserva Especial do Niassa,' reads a note to US citizens in Mozambique on the US Embassy's website.

**British Government Warns Against Travel to Niassa Districts in Mozambique**
The British Government advises against non-essential travel to the districts of Mecula and Marrupo in the province of Niassa, Mozambique, due to recent attacks by suspected insurgent groups in a protected area. The Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) warns that 'all travel, except essential travel, is advised against for the districts of Mecula and Marrupo, in the province of Niassa, due to attacks by groups linked to Islamic extremism.' The Mozambican Police have confirmed an investigation into a suspected new attack by insurgent groups in a hunting reserve near Cabo Delgado, which has been plagued by armed group attacks since 2017. The British Government joins the US Government in warning of terrorist movements in the Reserva Especial do Niassa, with the US Embassy advising American citizens to reconsider travel to the region. The province of Cabo Delgado has been experiencing a rebel insurgency since 2017, resulting in thousands of deaths and a humanitarian crisis, with over one million people displaced.

**Canada Updates Travel Advisories for Popular Destinations**
The Canadian government has updated its travel advisories for several popular destinations. Travelers are advised to exercise extreme caution due to high terrorist threats in France, where the country is at level 3 on the Vigipirate plan. Crowds can be dangerous, with frequent pickpocketing and targeting of tourists. Additionally, travelers should be wary of taxi scams and violent crimes, which are relatively rare but can occur. Travelers to Spain are also advised to be cautious due to high terrorist threats. In Spain, tourists should be vigilant in large gatherings, where thieves are common. The Canadian government warns that 'people posing as police officers in civilian clothes may ask to see your passport, ID, or wallet.' Travelers to Mexico are advised to exercise caution due to high crime rates and kidnapping risks. Several regional warnings are in effect, advising against non-essential travel to Chiapas, Colima, and the Lagunas de Zempoala national park in Morelos. In the state of Baja California Sur, the security situation has deteriorated since April 22, 2025, due to gunfights, arson, aggression, and theft. Travelers to Costa Rica are advised to exercise extreme caution due to high crime rates. Minor crimes, such as pickpocketing and bag snatching, are common, and tourists are often targeted. The advisory has been updated to include home burglaries and car thefts. Violent crimes also occur in Costa Rica, where drug trafficking is common. Women traveling alone should be particularly vigilant, as they may be targeted. The Canadian government advises travelers to exercise caution in Chile due to ongoing protests and civil unrest. Even peaceful protests can turn violent. The advisory has been updated to remove information about a tsunami alert. Minor crimes can occur, but travelers should be particularly vigilant in large cities like Santiago, Calama, and San Pedro d'Atacama. Armed robberies have increased in recent years. Argentina is generally safe, but the Buenos Aires metropolitan area and the Rosario region require extreme caution. A recent earthquake occurred on May 2 in the south of Ushuaia, and travelers should be cautious during visits. Crowds can be dangerous in Argentina, with frequent pickpocketing and targeting of tourists. Violent clashes between gangs are common in vulnerable neighborhoods, where police presence is low.

**U.S. Issues New Travel Warning for 2 Countries**
The United States has issued a new travel warning for two countries: Paraguay and Indonesia. For Paraguay, a Level 1 alert is in effect, advising travelers to 'exercise normal precautions' due to an increased crime risk in certain areas. A Level 2 warning is issued for these areas, where criminal groups are active and smuggling goods along the border with Brazil. In Indonesia, a Level 2 warning is also in effect due to threats of terrorism and natural disasters, while a Level 4 warning is issued for certain provinces due to civil unrest. According to the U.S. government, 'terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting police stations, places of worship, and other locations.' Additionally, natural disasters and demonstrations can also pose a risk to travelers.

**British Government Warns Against Travel to Mozambique's Niassa Province**
The British government's Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has advised against non-essential travel to the districts of Mecula and Marrupo in the province of Niassa, Mozambique, due to attacks by groups linked to Islamic extremism. According to the FCDO, 'all travel, except essential travel, is advised against for the districts of Mecula and Marrupo in the province of Niassa due to attacks by groups with links to Islamic extremism.' The Mozambican police are investigating a suspected new attack by insurgent groups on a hunting reserve in the Reserva Especial do Niassa, which borders Cabo Delgado province. The reserve has been the site of two alleged terrorist movements in recent weeks, with the first reported on April 24. Local reports indicate that the group, whose number is still unknown, entered a village in the reserve, causing panic among residents. The Mozambican Defense Minister, Cristóvão Chume, acknowledged the existence of terrorist groups in the reserve, saying 'we know they are terrorists and we are after them.' The US government has also warned of terrorist movements in the Reserva Especial do Niassa, advising its citizens to reconsider travel to the region. 'The US Government has received information that terrorists attacked villages on the borders of the Reserva Especial do Niassa, before entering the reserve and taking hostages in a private hunting lodge. Mozambican security forces are engaged. Be aware of the increase in violence in the southeastern and eastern borders of the Reserva Especial do Niassa,' reads a note to US citizens in Mozambique on the US Embassy's website.

**Mozambique Protests Result in 22 Police Deaths and 178 Injuries**
Violent protests in Mozambique, sparked by supporters of failed presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, resulted in the deaths of 22 police officers and injuries to 178 others, according to official sources. The protests, which occurred after the October 2024 elections, were marked by 'excesses' committed by some protesters and security forces, said Mozambique's Attorney General, Américio Letela. The elections, won by Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo with over 65% of the vote, were followed by a failed attempt by Mondlane to destabilize the country, which he had promised to do if he was not declared the winner. Despite a large public campaign, Mondlane's call for a national dialogue, which was attended by forces from all political parties, including the coalition Podemos, was insufficient to mobilize the crowds he had hoped for, and the situation returned to normal in the country.

**US reissues travel advisory for Bangladesh; Level 4 'Do not travel' alert for these areas**
The United States has reissued its travel advisory for Bangladesh, warning citizens to reconsider travel to the country due to risks of civil unrest, crime, and terrorism. The advisory maintains a 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' warning for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region, citing persistent threats of violence, crime, and kidnapping. The US government advises against travel to these areas, stating, 'Do not travel to these areas for any reason.' While political violence has subsided since the establishment of an interim government, protests and demonstrations can still escalate into violence. Petty crime is common in urban centres, and the US government's ability to provide emergency services may be limited outside of Dhaka due to poor infrastructure and local access restrictions.

**'Communal Violence, Terrorism': US Issues New Travel Advisory For Bangladesh Amid Political Unrest**
The United States has issued a 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' alert for Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh due to communal violence, crime, terrorism, kidnapping, and other security risks. The US has also maintained a 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel' alert for the country, warning travellers to reconsider going to Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism. The advisory warns of risks of terrorist violence, muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking in Bangladesh's major cities. US government employees have been prohibited from non-essential travel within Dhaka outside of the diplomatic enclave, and are required to obtain special authorisation to travel outside of Dhaka. The US government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Bangladesh, particularly outside of Dhaka, due to travel restrictions and limited host government emergency response resources. 'US citizens are reminded to avoid all gatherings, even peaceful ones, since they could turn violent with little or no warning,' the advisory read. 'Since summer 2024, civil unrest and violent clashes have largely subsided with the formation of the Interim Government. Occasional protests continue with potential for violent clashes,' it added.

**US issues new travel advisory for Bangladesh amid political violence: 'Do not travel to these areas'**
The US government has issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts region, citing high risks of violence, crime, and kidnapping. The advisory warns of incidents of communal unrest, terrorism, and political violence, including IED explosions and active shootings. The US State Department advises against traveling to the region and urges US citizens to reconsider travel to Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism. While foreigners are not specifically targeted, common crimes such as pickpocketing and muggings are prevalent in major cities. The US government's ability to provide emergency services to citizens may be limited due to infrastructure issues and restricted access. 'Do not travel to these areas for any reason,' the advisory stated. The advisory comes after a prominent Hindu community leader, Bhabesh Chandra Roy, was allegedly abducted and beaten to death in north Bangladesh.

**US Issues Travel Advisories for 23 Countries Due to Security, Crime, and Terrorism Concerns**
The US Department of State has issued significant travel advisories for 23 countries, primarily in Africa and South America, under the category of 'reconsider visits'. This classification, corresponding to the third level of a four-level system, implies that travelers should carefully evaluate the risks before visiting these destinations. The Department of State reported that this decision responds to concerns related to security, crime, and terrorism in the affected regions. The list includes popular tourist destinations such as Egypt, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Colombia, as well as less frequented countries like Chad, Bangladesh, and Mozambique. The update also covers Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and island territories like New Caledonia and Vanuatu. According to the Department of State, the reasons behind these advisories vary from terrorist activity to organized crime and drug trafficking. Egypt, for instance, is a destination that attracts millions of tourists annually due to its iconic historical sites and Red Sea resorts, but the Department of State warned about the persistence of terrorist threats in the country, stating that 'extremists continue to express interest in planning attacks in the country against religious places, government entities, and diplomatic installations.' Despite these warnings, Egypt remains considered one of the safest destinations within the African continent. However, the Department of State urged travelers to stay informed and take additional precautions when visiting the country. In the case of Jamaica, concerns focus on crime, including violent crimes and homicides. According to the Department of State, these problems have led to including the country in the category of 'reconsider visits.' Other Caribbean nations, such as Trinidad and Tobago, also feature on the list due to similar risks. On the other hand, the British territory of Turks and Caicos, known for its luxurious tourist complexes, received a specific warning related to compliance with local laws. Although this destination is at the level two of 'exercise increased caution,' the DOE warned about recent cases in which US tourists were arrested for carrying ammunition in their luggage. According to the warning, 'the police strictly enforce these laws, even at the airport when travelers are departing.' The incidents have resulted in prolonged detentions and significant fines for those involved. In Central America, countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua were also included in the list due to concerns related to organized crime and drug trafficking. According to the Department of State, these nations are key routes for traffickers heading towards Mexico and, subsequently, the United States. In South America, Colombia is among the countries mentioned, despite being a growing tourist destination. US authorities have warned about risks associated with crime and violence in certain areas of the country, advising visitors to avoid specific zones. The countries mentioned in the Department of State's alerts present a wide range of risks and levels of popularity among US tourists. While destinations like Egypt and Jamaica are widely visited, others, such as Chad and Bangladesh, receive a significantly lower number of visitors. According to the Department, the advisories cover everything from minor crimes to more serious threats, such as terrorism and narcotics trafficking. In the case of Bangladesh, for example, concerns expressed in September 2024 focus on civil unrest, crime, and terrorism.

**State department cites civilian casualties , terrorism in 'do not travel' order for African nation**
The US Department of State has ordered non-emergency US government employees to leave the Democratic Republic of Congo due to ongoing violence and civil unrest. The travel advisory has been raised to level 4, warning Americans not to travel to the country. The warning cites 'violent crime, such as armed robbery, kidnapping, murder, rape, and assault, is common' and that local police lack resources to respond effectively. Demonstrations are also common, often turning violent and targeting civilians, with police using 'heavy-handed tactics that resulted in civilian casualties and arrests.' Terrorists and other groups have also attacked military and civilian targets, posing a threat to humanitarian aid workers. If you choose to visit DRC, you are encouraged to have your passport with you at all times, avoid demonstrations, and use caution when walking or driving.

**British Government Lifts Travel Warning for Mozambique, Except for Certain Areas**
The British government has removed the travel warning for non-essential trips to Mozambique, citing a decrease in post-election protests. However, the warning remains in place for certain areas in the provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula due to terrorist threats. According to the British government's website, 'In recent months, significant disturbances have been reported in Mozambique following the national elections of 09 October 2024. The situation has improved since the end of December, but there is still a possibility of new sporadic disturbances. Road tolls are particularly vulnerable to sudden protests.' The protests have been ongoing since October 21, with clashes between police and protesters, looting, and destruction of public and private property. The opposition candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, has been contesting the election results and has called for a boycott of road tolls, leading to the destruction of some toll booths. The current President, Daniel Chapo, has been in talks with political parties to discuss reforms, including changes to the electoral law and the constitution. However, Mondlane has not participated in these talks. 'I am in dialogue with political parties to discuss state reforms, including changes to the electoral law and the Constitution, in the face of the post-election crisis in the country,' Chapo said.

**Foreign Office urgent 'only essential' travel warning issued after unrest**
The UK's Foreign Office has issued an urgent travel advisory for Brits considering visiting Mozambique due to significant political unrest. The Foreign Office advises against 'all but essential travel' to Mozambique, citing unpredictable violence, disruptions to travel, and increased incidents of criminality. The warning also extends to cautioning against travel near the South Africa-Mozambique border, where over 1,500 inmates escaped from a jail in December. The Foreign Office warns that protests can be violent, and police have used live ammunition, leading to civilian casualties. The 'all but essential' travel warning applies to all of Mozambique, with specific advice against all travel to certain districts in Cabo Delgado Province due to attacks by Islamist extremist groups. The Foreign Office advises Brits to seek local advice, monitor local media, and avoid large gatherings or demonstrations. 'There is significant unrest across Mozambique which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future,' the Foreign Office said. 'Protests can be violent and occur at short notice.'

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

1. **InsureMyTrip Article (Oct 2021)**
   - Provides factual overview of the US State Department's four-tier travel advisory system
   - Explains risk indicators (C, T, U, H, N, E, K, O) and review schedules
   - Good background information but not Mozambique-specific
   - High informational value but lacks recency

2. **Government of Canada Travel Advisories**
   - Official government source explaining Canada's three-tier advisory system
   - Provides comparative context to understand severity levels across different countries' systems
   - Purely informational, no Mozambique-specific content

3. **Liverpool Echo Article (Jan 6, 2025)**
   - Reports UK's upgraded travel advisory for Mozambique to "against all but essential travel" countrywide and "against all travel" for certain regions
   - Cites specific security incidents: prison breaks (1,500 escapees), election protests, and lethal force by police
   - Quotes official FCDO warnings about "significant unrest" expected to "continue for the foreseeable future"
   - Most recent and detailed source on Mozambique's security situation

4. **EWN Article (Nov 7, 2024)**
   - Reports South Africa's warning to citizens to postpone travel to Mozambique
   - Details post-election violence following the ruling Frelimo party's claimed 70% victory
   - Describes border closures and military deployment
   - Somewhat dated (6 months old) but establishes start of current unrest

5. **SABC News Article (Dec 2, 2024)**
   - Reports Southern Africa Tourism Services Association advisory for holiday travelers
   - Notes protests were concentrated around certain border areas while popular tourist destinations remained unaffected
   - Less severe assessment than other sources, but still 5 months old

6. **Perplexity Report on Level 4 Advisories**
   - Comprehensive analysis of US Level 4 advisories since 2020
   - Identifies common triggers: armed conflict, terrorism, political instability, kidnapping/crime
   - Lists all current Level 4 countries and their justifications
   - No mention of Mozambique among current Level 4 countries
   - Provides valuable benchmark for comparing Mozambique's situation to existing Level 4 designations

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

1. **Countries with political unrest and contested elections that received Level 4 advisories**
   - Examples: Venezuela, Belarus
   - Similarity: Post-election protests, government crackdowns, disruption to normal operations
   - Mozambique's situation shows parallels but may lack the same intensity of government persecution

2. **African countries with Level 4 advisories**
   - Examples: Central African Republic, Sudan, Somalia, South Sudan
   - These countries typically have more severe conditions: active civil war, complete governance collapse, or entrenched terrorist control
   - Mozambique has localized unrest but not country-wide armed conflict

3. **Countries where UK/other allies issued highest warnings before US Level 4 designation**
   - Several precedents exist where US follows allied nations in elevating travel warnings
   - UK's "against all travel" for parts of Mozambique is significant
   - However, US has had ~5 months since UK's designation to follow suit and hasn't yet

4. **Countries with partial Level 4 designations (specific regions)**
   - US sometimes issues Level 4 warnings for specific regions rather than entire countries
   - UK specifically warned against Cabo Delgado Province due to insurgent attacks
   - Most suitable reference class as it accounts for Mozambique's regionally varied security situation

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

- Today is May 2, 2025; resolution date is July 1, 2025 (~2 months window)
- Current unrest began around November 2024 (6 months ago)
- UK upgraded its advisory in December 2024 (5 months ago)
- Per the InsureMyTrip source, Level 3 & 4 advisories undergo semi-annual review
- Level 4 designations can happen quickly when situations deteriorate substantially
- No evidence of improvement in Mozambique's situation since January 2025 (most recent source)
- The fact that US hasn't issued Level 4 despite 5+ months of unrest suggests either: different assessment than UK, situation stabilization not reflected in sources, or policy considerations causing delay

## (d) Justification

Mozambique presents a mixed case when compared to typical Level 4 countries. The situation features several risk factors:

1. **Political violence**: Post-election protests with multiple civilian casualties from police using live ammunition
2. **Prison breaks**: 1,500 inmates escaped with only 150 recaptured as of January
3. **Border disruptions**: Closures affecting key crossing points with South Africa
4. **Regional insurgency**: UK specifically warns against travel to Cabo Delgado Province due to Islamist attacks

However, Mozambique lacks some characteristics common to Level 4 countries:
1. No full-scale civil war or territorial control by terrorist groups (unlike Afghanistan, Syria)
2. Government still functions, though contested (unlike Haiti, Somalia)
3. No pattern of hostage-taking or detention of foreigners (unlike Russia, Iran)
4. Tourist areas reportedly less affected (per SABC article)

The UK's "against all travel" advisory for parts of Mozambique represents a significant indicator, as does South Africa's warning against non-essential travel. However, the US State Department has had approximately 5 months to follow these allied nations and has not yet issued a Level 4 advisory.

# Outside view calibration:

I need to calibrate my forecast based on reference classes and historical patterns rather than specifics of Mozambique's situation.

From the Perplexity report, countries receiving Level 4 designations typically face more severe conditions than currently described in Mozambique. The current Level 4 list includes war zones (Ukraine, Syria), failed states (Haiti, Somalia), and countries with systematic targeting of foreigners (Iran, North Korea).

The UK's highest warning for parts of Mozambique suggests the situation meets their threshold for extreme danger, but the US often applies stricter criteria for Level 4 designations. The fact that the US hasn't followed the UK after 5 months suggests they view the situation differently.

Looking at the timeframe, with just 2 months until resolution, the US would need to act relatively soon. Level 4 advisories typically follow either dramatic deterioration or accumulated evidence of persistent danger. Neither pattern is clearly established by the sources.

Based on reference classes of countries with regional conflicts and political unrest, and considering the gap between allied nations' warnings and US action, I assess the probability at 20%. This reflects that while Mozambique has concerning security issues, they haven't reached the severity threshold that typically triggers US Level 4 advisories, and the US has had ample time to issue such an advisory but hasn't.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**InsureMyTrip article (Oct 2021):** This source explains the US State Department's four-tier travel advisory system implemented in 2018. It provides factual information about the different levels, risk indicators (C, T, U, H, etc.), and review schedules (Levels 3-4 are reviewed semi-annually). While somewhat dated, it offers essential background for understanding the advisory framework.

**Government of Canada's Travel Advisories page:** This source outlines Canada's three-tiered advisory system ("Exercise a high degree of caution," "Avoid non-essential travel," and "Do not travel"). While it mentions similar systems used by other countries including the US, it offers limited direct relevance to our specific question.

**Liverpool Echo article (Jan 6, 2025):** This recent news source reports that on December 30, 2024, the UK government upgraded its travel advisory for Mozambique to "against all but essential travel" countrywide and "against all travel" for certain regions. It cites specific security incidents (prison break with 1,500 escapees) and political unrest following contested elections. The article quotes official FCDO warnings about "significant unrest," violent protests, police using live ammunition, and increased criminality.

**EWN article (Nov 7, 2024):** This article details South Africa's response to protests in Mozambique following the late-2024 election where the ruling Frelimo party claimed over 70% of the vote amidst opposition claims of fraud. It factually reports on border closures, violence, and South Africa's official DIRCO recommendation to "postpone non-essential visits" to Mozambique.

**SABC News article (Dec 2, 2024):** This source reports on the Southern Africa Tourism Services Association's advisory to South African tourists regarding border disruptions in Mozambique. It notes that while protests affected certain border posts, popular tourist destinations remained unaffected, suggesting localized rather than nationwide security concerns.

**Perplexity report on Level 4 advisories:** This comprehensive analysis identifies countries with current Level 4 advisories and their common triggers. It shows that as of early 2025, 17 countries have Level 4 designations, with armed conflict, terrorism, political instability, kidnapping, and crime being the primary reasons. The report appears well-researched with multiple citations and provides valuable context on how the State Department applies its highest warning level.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

Several potential reference classes emerge:

1. **Current Level 4 countries (Afghanistan, Myanmar, etc.):** These nations typically experience severe armed conflict, terrorism, or state collapse. Mozambique's situation appears less extreme than most of these cases.

2. **Countries where other Western governments have issued their highest warnings:** The UK's "against all travel" advisory for parts of Mozambique suggests alignment with at least some Level 4 criteria. This reference class is particularly relevant as Western governments often make similar risk assessments.

3. **African countries with political instability:** Several African nations with political unrest have received Level 4 advisories (Sudan, Somalia, CAR, South Sudan), suggesting regional precedent.

4. **Countries with contested elections and violent protests:** Venezuela, Belarus, and Haiti have received Level 4 advisories following electoral disputes and subsequent unrest, similar to Mozambique's current situation.

The most suitable reference class appears to be #2 and #4 combined: countries experiencing post-election unrest where other Western governments have already issued severe travel warnings. This provides the most direct comparison to Mozambique's situation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Our prediction window spans from May 2, 2025, to July 1, 2025—approximately 2 months. Several timeline considerations:

- Political unrest has persisted in Mozambique since at least November 2024 (6+ months)
- The UK elevated its advisory on December 30, 2024 (4+ months ago)
- Level 4 advisories undergo semi-annual reviews according to State Department policy

Given that other countries issued warnings 4-6 months ago and the semi-annual review cycle, the US State Department may be due for a review of Mozambique's status within our prediction timeframe.

## (d) Justification

Based on the available information, several factors influence the likelihood of a Level 4 advisory:

**Supporting factors:**
- The UK has already issued its highest warning level for parts of Mozambique
- Political unrest has persisted for at least 6 months with reports of violence, deaths, and criminality
- Prison breaks and violent protests indicate deteriorating security conditions
- The US has previously issued Level 4 advisories for several African countries with political instability
- The timeline suggests the State Department may be due for a review of Mozambique's status

**Limiting factors:**
- Mozambique's situation appears less severe than many current Level 4 countries (no full-scale war or territorial control by terrorist groups)
- Some tourist areas reportedly remain unaffected, suggesting localized rather than nationwide threats
- Current reports don't indicate systematic targeting of foreigners or Americans specifically
- The prison break situation has reportedly been partially resolved (150 of 1,500 escapees recaptured)

# Outside view calibration:

To calibrate my prediction, I need to consider the base rate and specific circumstances. The Perplexity report indicates approximately 17 out of 195 countries (8.7%) currently have Level 4 advisories, making this designation relatively rare. However, Mozambique's situation contains several risk factors that align with Level 4 criteria.

The UK's decision to issue its highest warning for parts of Mozambique is particularly significant, as Western governments often reach similar security assessments. The persistent nature of the unrest (6+ months) suggests this isn't a transient problem likely to resolve quickly.

While Mozambique is experiencing serious political instability and violence, the intensity doesn't match that of countries like Afghanistan, Syria, or Yemen. The situation appears more comparable to countries like Haiti or Venezuela, which received Level 4 advisories for political instability and crime without full-scale war.

Given the semi-annual review cycle and the timeline of events, there's a reasonable chance the State Department could review and upgrade Mozambique's status within our prediction timeframe if conditions don't improve.

   a. InsureMyTrip (Oct. 26 2021)  
     – Summarizes the US State Department’s four-tier advisory system, review cadence, and risk indicators.  
     – Source quality: Good for procedural facts; no Mozambique-specific data.  
     – Factual vs. opinion: Primarily factual description of advisory mechanics.  
   b. Government of Canada travel advisories page  
     – Explains Canada’s analogous advisory levels (“do not travel,” etc.).  
     – Source quality: Official and reliable for framing comparative context.  
     – No direct Mozambique data; factual.  
   c. Liverpool Echo (Fiona Callingham, Jan 6 2025)  
     – Reports UK FCDO raised Mozambique advice to “against all but essential” nationally and “against all travel” to specific regions, citing protests, violence, prison break.  
     – Source quality: Regional newspaper quoting official FCDO statements; high credence for UK policy.  
     – Factual statements on violence and FCDO language; some interpretation but grounded in direct quotes.  
   d. Eyewitness News (Orrin Singh, Nov 7 2024)  
     – Details mass protests post-election, fatalities, border closures by South Africa, government military deployments.  
     – Source quality: South African news outlet reporting local developments; reliable on protest details.

   e. SABC News (Dec 2 2024)  
     – Reports SATSA advisory urging South Africans to monitor service-provider guidance amid protests.  
     – Source quality: Official tourism association; reliable for industry advisories.  
     – Factual.  
   f. Perplexity report (Level 4 advisories 2020–2025)  
     – Lists 17 countries designated Level 4, their dates and reasons; identifies common triggers (conflict, terrorism, instability).  
     – Source quality: Likely aggregated from official State Dept releases but unverified; treat details as plausible but check kernel of truth (global advisory in Mar 2020; major conflict zones).  
     – Factual summary mixed with inferred categorizations; moderate confidence in broad patterns, less in exact dates.

2. Reference class analysis  
   Possible classes:  
   • Countries upgraded from Level 2/3 to Level 4 due to civil unrest/protests (e.g., Myanmar post-coup, Belarus post-2020 crackdown?)  
   • Countries with insurgencies plus political violence (e.g., CAR, Libya).  
   • All non-Level 4 countries receiving a Level 4 upgrade within a six-month review window.  
   Suitability:  
   – The broad “all non-Level 4 countries” class yields a baseline of ∼3 upgrades per 180 days across ~200 countries ⇒ ~1.5% chance per country per semester. Too coarse.  
   – The “insurgency + political violence” class is narrower: recent CAR and Libya upgrades fit but both had active armed conflict, not just protests. Mozambique is not a civil war but has Islamist insurgency in Cabo Delgado plus election-related unrest. This suggests intermediate risk.  
   Chosen class: “Countries with both terrorist/insurgent violence and significant political unrest/riots.” Historically, CAR and Libya were upgraded; timeline from major escalation to advisory was on the order of months.  

3. Timeframe analysis  
   – Today is May 2, 2025; outcome window is ~60 days.  
   – The US State Department conducts semiannual reviews of Levels 3 and 4; the last one was likely January 2025, the next scheduled in June 2025. That gives one predictable update slot plus any ad hoc updates.  
   – Historical pattern: 2–4 new Level 4 designations per six-month period. Ad hoc changes (e.g., due to natural disasters or sudden conflicts) account for perhaps 1 per period.  

4. Additional context  
   – UK has already tightened its advice, signalling Western alignment on threat escalation.  
   – Regional actors (Canada, South Africa) have advised against non-essential travel.  
   – Mozambique faces a dual security threat: Islamist insurgency in the north and election unrest nationwide.  
   – The US typically reserves Level 4 for life-threatening environments (active war zones, terrorist havens). While Mozambique’s insurgency is serious, it has not reached the scale of a declared civil war.  

5. Justification for outside view  
   – Base-rate (reference class) for any non-Level 4 country being upgraded in 60 days: ~1.5%.  
   – Adjustment for relevant triggers: Mozambique’s combination of insurgent violence and nationwide unrest is similar to CAR/Libya cases—those elevated within months, but they involved sustained armed conflict. Mozambique’s insurgency is localized to Cabo Delgado and has been ongoing for years without US Level 4. The new variable is election unrest, but scale remains below war-zone threshold.  
   – Signalling from UK and regional bodies increases likelihood of US follow-through, but US risk tolerance is higher.  
   – Timing aligns with scheduled June review (one opportunity). Ad hoc update possible if violence spikes dramatically.  

Outside view calibration:  
Combine the base-rate (1.5%) with an uplift for medium-high relevance of triggers (+10–15 percentage points), tempered by US historical caution on violence outside war zones (–5–10 points).Net calibrated probability ≈1.5% + 12% – 6% = ~7.5%. Round modestly upward to reflect proximity to review window and cross-government signalling.  

Outside View Prediction:  
8% chance that Mozambique will receive a US State Department Level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. InsureMyTrip (Oct 26 2021) – Explains the U.S. four-tier advisory system, review schedule, and risk indicators. High reliability for procedural context (annual vs. semi-annual reviews, risk codes), minimal opinion.  
2. Canada Travel Advisories – Describes parallel Canadian system. Useful for comparison but not determinative of U.S. action. Factual and authoritative on Canada’s levels.  
3. Liverpool Echo (Jan 6 2025) – Reports that on Dec 30 2024 the UK FCDO moved Mozambique to “against all but essential travel” country-wide (akin to a high Level 3 or low Level 4). Source quotes senior FCDO officials; well sourced for U.K. stance and on-the-ground events (prison break, protests).  
4. EWN (Nov 7 2024) – Summarizes South African warnings amid week-long protests and border closures. Credible for regional spillover but less weight on U.S. policy.  
5. SABC News (Dec 2 2024) – Tourism-industry advisory from SATSA. Local industry view rather than government policy. Indicates limited unrest but confined to border posts.  
6. Perplexity_report – Aggregates all Level 4 advisories since 2020, their triggers (conflict, terrorism, crime, health), frequency, and review cycles. Good synthetic baseline for “how often does a Level 3 country get bumped to Level 4?” but relies on secondary sources—take frequency figures as approximate.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
• Countries at Level 3 that rose to Level 4 within ~6 months of increased unrest (e.g., Haiti moved from 3 to 4 in Mar 2025 after gang violence).  
• Countries with sporadic protests but limited conflict that did *not* move to Level 4 (e.g., Thailand, South Africa).  
• Historical frequency: U.S. has issued ~2–3 new country-specific Level 4 advisories per year since 2020 (excluding the blanket COVID alert). With ~180 potential Level 2/3 countries, a *random* one has ~1–2% annual chance.  

Mozambique sits in the mid-to-high risk bracket among Level 2/3 countries (civil unrest, Islamist insurgency in north, rising crime). Its UK “against all but essential” status signals above-average risk relative to the Level 3 cohort, but the U.S. typically lags the U.K. in upgrading. The most suitable reference class is “Level 3 countries experiencing significant unrest/insurgent violence and seeing a next-review upgrade to Level 4 within 6 months.” Historical hits in this class are rare (1–2 per year globally).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today is May 2, 2025. The question horizon is July 1, 2025 (≈60 days). U.S. policy calls for semi-annual reviews of Level 3/4 advisories; the next scheduled review likely June 2025, plus the possibility of an ad-hoc update if violence spikes dramatically. Thus there is one structured decision point before the cutoff, and a slim window for reactive upgrades.

(d) Justification  
• Base rate: ~1–2 new country-specific Level 4 advisories per year → ≈1.5% chance per country per year.  
• Time compression: 60 days is ~⅙ of a year → base = ~0.25%.  
• Risk uplift: Mozambique’s combination of post-election protests, insurgency in Cabo Delgado, significant prison escape and border tensions, and the U.K.’s move to very restrictive advice suggest it is above the generic country.  
• U.S. behavior lag: The U.S. has not yet signaled Level 4 for Mozambique as of May 2025; Canada and Australia have not moved beyond “high caution/avoid non-essential.” Historically the U.S. reserves Level 4 for either severe civil war or terror-driven kidnapping risk. Mozambique’s unrest, while serious, has not reached those thresholds in U.S. eyes—yet.  
• Net adjustment: From a 0.25% time-weighted base, apply a “severe unrest” uplift factor of ~20× for relative risk posture → ~5%. Then adjust further upward (×3–4) because the U.K. has already taken a near-Level 4 stance and U.S. often converges on allied moves within months → ~15–20%.

Outside-view calibration:  
Accounting for the compressed timeframe (60 days), a very limited decision window, and U.S. reluctance to escalate to Level 4 absent mass violence or terror episodes, the calibrated outside-view probability is toward the lower end of the 15–20% band. A 17% probability reflects modest but non-trivial risk of an upgrade by July 1, 2025.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 17% chance that Mozambique will receive a U.S. State Department “Level 4 – Do Not Travel” advisory before July 1, 2025.

Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
• InsureMyTrip explainer (Oct 2021) – Purely descriptive; cites State-Dept regulations.  High factual reliability, no opinions that affect the forecast.  
• Canada travel-advice explainer – Also descriptive of Canada’s own system; tangential.  High factual reliability, low direct relevance.  
• Liverpool Echo (UK) 6 Jan 2025 – News report on FCDO raising Mozambique to “against all but essential travel”.  Facts: prison break, violent protests, casualties, FCDO wording.  Opinions limited to FCDO risk assessment (credible, government source) and journalist framing (moderate weight).  
• EWN (South Africa) 7 Nov 2024 – Report on post-election protests.  Facts: protests, deaths, border closure.  Opinion: DIRCO warning; again a government source, credible.  
• SABC 2 Dec 2024 – Tourism‐industry warning to South Africans; factual.  Opinion: SATSA view that most resorts remain safe – industry bias noted.  
• Perplexity Level-4 catalogue – Compiled list (2020-25) referencing State-Dept updates.  Mostly factual but secondary synthesis; cross-checked with known State-Dept postings and broadly accurate.  Useful for base-rate calculation.

(b)  Reference class analysis  
RC-1: “Any country in the world receiving a brand-new Level 4 advisory in a two-month window.”  
 • From 2020-24 about 35 country-level Level 4 updates occurred; 7–8 were new (i.e., country not already at L-4).  Roughly 1.5 new L-4s per year ≈ 0.125 per month ⇒ 0.25 in two months.  Dividing by 195 countries → base probability ≈ 0.13% for a random country.  
RC-2: “Countries currently at Level 2 that were escalated straight to Level 4 within a two-month window.”  
 • Historical examples are extremely rare (COVID global advisory aside).  Estimate: 0–1 cases in seven years → ≤0.02 per year ⇒ base P ≈ 0.01% in two months.  
RC-3 (chosen): “Sub-Saharan African countries at Level 2 or 3 experiencing localised insurgency or unrest.”  
 • Members 2018-24: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Sudan, Mali, Niger, CAR, DRC, Nigeria, Mozambique, etc.  
 • Of ~15 such states, 5 were moved to Level 4 at some point (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Sudan, CAR).  Escalations cluster around major coups or interstate war.  Annual chance per country ≈ 5/15/7 yrs ≈ 4.8%.  Two-month slice ≈ 0.8%.  This class captures Mozambique’s underlying risk profile without overweighting extreme outliers.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
• Today → 1 July 2025 = 60 days (≈0.16 yr).  
• State-Dept review cycle: Level 2 countries reviewed annually; Mozambique’s last full-country update was Oct 2024.  Next scheduled review likely Oct 2025, outside the window.  Only an ad-hoc emergency would trigger an interim jump.  Historically, emergency upgrades average 2–3 per year worldwide.  Chance any one of those targets Mozambique in the next 60 days is low.

(d)  Justification for outside-view probability  
1.  Base-rate (RC-3) for a comparable African “medium-risk” state turning Level 4 in any given 60-day window ~0.8%.  
2.  Need for an unscheduled update further lowers the odds; about half of Level-4 upgrades are scheduled semi-annual reviews.  Therefore unscheduled probability ≈ 0.4%.  
3.  Mozambique has never held a nationwide Level 4 despite years of Cabo Delgado insurgency—evidence that the U.S. tends to localise, not nationalise, its warnings here.  This historical stickiness cuts the figure again, roughly in half → 0.2%.  
4.  Rounding conservatively upward to reflect model uncertainty and the fact that multiple sources (UK, SA) now caution strongly, we arrive at an outside-view estimate near 1 in 200.

Outside view calibration:
No numerical anchor in sources explicitly states the chance.  I adopt 0.5 % as the midpoint of the 0.2–0.8 % plausible band, rounded to the nearest 0.1 %.

Outside View Prediction:
0.5 % (≈ 1-in-200 odds) that Mozambique will receive a Level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory from the U.S. State Department before 1 July 2025.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Travel.gc.ca (Canadian advisory, current)**
- Official Canadian government assessment showing high-level concerns
- Advises against all travel to 14 districts of Cabo Delgado Province and 2 districts in Nampula due to insurgent activity
- Credible source with detailed security breakdown

**NYT article (Jan 2, 2025, 4 months old)**
- Reputable international source reporting widespread protests following contested election
- Reports 250+ deaths in clashes between security forces and protesters
- Details nationwide political instability triggered by electoral dispute

**Zimbabwe Mail (Nov 14, 2024, 6 months old)**
- Reports 30+ deaths from protests with expert opinions from named sources
- Adriano Nuvunga (Centre for Democracy and Human Rights) and Prof. Peter Baur provide informed analysis
- Details cross-border impacts and South Africa's travel advisories

**Recent news articles (May 1-2, 2025)**
- Multiple sources reporting UK FCDO's new advisory against travel to Niassa districts
- Very current (days old) information showing geographic expansion of insurgency
- Reports of terrorist attacks and hostage-taking at a hunting lodge in Niassa
- US Embassy warning mentioned (advising to "reconsider travel" to Niassa)
- Lists of 21 countries under US Level 4 advisories - Mozambique NOT included

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Geographic spread of insurgency:** Multiple reliable sources confirm expansion of terrorist activity from Cabo Delgado to Niassa Province with Mozambican Defense Minister Cristóvão Chume confirming "they are terrorists and we are after them." (May 2025)
- **Allied nations' warnings:** UK and Canadian governments advise against all travel to specific districts, with UK adding two Niassa districts very recently (May 2025)
- **Current absence from Level 4 list:** Multiple recent sources explicitly list 21 countries with Level 4 US travel advisories, and Mozambique is not among them (May 2025)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Ongoing political instability:** Multiple sources confirm protests continuing since October 2024 election, with varying estimates of casualties (30-250+ deaths)
- **Hostage-taking incident:** Recent reports of terrorists taking hostages at a hunting lodge in Niassa (May 2025)
- **US Embassy's current response:** Embassy issued "reconsider travel" advisory (Level 3) for Niassa region rather than Level 4 despite recent hostage situation (May 2025)

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Prison break:** Report of 1,500 inmates escaping (from older sources)
- **Border disruptions:** Affects regional travel but less relevant to US advisory decisions

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question asks about a Level 4 advisory before July 1, 2025, leaving approximately 2 months from today (May 2, 2025).

- If the timeframe were halved (1 month), probability would decrease to ~15% as there would be less time for security situation to deteriorate further and for US State Department to complete assessment process
- If doubled (4 months), probability would increase to ~30% due to additional time for insurgency patterns to be established and documented

## (d) Justification

Several factors suggest Mozambique could receive a Level 4 advisory:
1. The insurgency has recently expanded beyond Cabo Delgado to Niassa Province
2. Recent hostage-taking incidents represent escalation of threat to foreigners
3. UK has just issued its highest warning level for Niassa districts
4. Ongoing political instability creates nationwide unpredictability

However, stronger factors argue against a Level 4 advisory being issued within 2 months:
1. The insurgency remains regional rather than countrywide (unlike most Level 4 countries)
2. The US Embassy already assessed the Niassa situation and issued a Level 3 ("reconsider travel") rather than Level 4 advisory
3. Cabo Delgado insurgency has persisted since 2017 without triggering a US Level 4 advisory
4. Political violence has been ongoing for 7 months without escalation to Level 4
5. Mozambique not currently among the 21 countries with Level 4 advisories

# Probability calibration

Based on the evidence, I need to calibrate my assessment with comparable reference classes:

- Countries with insurgencies contained to specific regions typically receive regional Level 4 advisories only if foreign nationals are specifically targeted
- The US has historically had a higher threshold than allies for issuing Level 4 advisories
- The immediate US Embassy response to Niassa (Level 3 not Level 4) despite hostage situation provides the strongest current signal of US assessment
- Level 4 is reserved for the most dangerous places globally with widespread conflict, terrorism, or state hostility toward Americans

The most compelling evidence suggests that while the situation in Mozambique is concerning, it hasn't yet crossed the threshold for a Level 4 advisory despite clear opportunities for the US to make that determination. The specific targeting of foreigners in Niassa presents the most likely pathway to a Level 4 advisory, but the initial US response suggests they don't yet view it at that level of severity.

Given these factors, I assess there is approximately a 20% chance that Mozambique will receive a Level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory before July 1, 2025.

# Checklist:
1. Will Mozambique receive a Level 4 US travel advisory before July 1, 2025?
2. Base: Countries with regional insurgencies but not countrywide collapse typically ~20% chance
3. 20/100 times, the US would issue a Level 4 advisory for Mozambique in this situation
4. Key evidence: 
   - US already assessed Niassa situation at Level 3 not Level 4
   - Cabo Delgado insurgency ongoing since 2017 without Level 4
   - UK's new "avoid all travel" warning for Niassa
   - Recent terrorist hostage-taking incident
5. Blind spot: Dramatic deterioration involving US citizens as hostages
6. Status quo has been maintained despite 7+ months of unrest and years of regional insurgency

Probability: 20%
Predicted Probability: 20.0%

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
1. **Geographic expansion of terrorist threat**
   - Multiple independent sources confirm new attacks in Niassa Province
   - US Embassy has already issued specific warnings about terrorist movements in Niassa (May 2, 2025)
   - Direct causal mechanism: expansion of security threats is a primary driver for Level 4 designations

2. **Diplomatic alignment on escalating threats**
   - UK has just issued new warnings for Niassa districts (May 2, 2025)
   - Canada maintains high-level warnings for multiple regions
   - Historical pattern shows diplomatic coordination on security assessments

3. **Dual security threats**
   - Terrorism: Expanding from Cabo Delgado to Nampula and now Niassa
   - Civil unrest: Ongoing protests since October 2024 election
   - Combined threats typically warrant higher advisory levels

### Moderate Evidence
1. **Violence statistics**
   - Recent reports of 22 police deaths and 178 injuries (April 30, 2025)
   - Previous reporting of 250+ civilian deaths since late 2024
   - Scale suggests significant security deterioration

2. **Timing relative to review cycle**
   - Current date (May 2) suggests June 2025 would be next regular review period
   - New security developments provide justification for reassessment

3. **Ongoing political instability**
   - Disputed election remains unresolved
   - Opposition figure not participating in reconciliation talks

### Weak Evidence
1. **Previous non-inclusion in Level 4 list**
   - Mozambique not among 21 countries receiving Level 4 on May 1, 2025
   - But doesn't account for very recent Niassa developments

2. **Earlier improvement claims**
   - Some January 2025 sources suggested improved situation
   - Contradicted by more recent violence reports

## (c) Timeframe Analysis
The prediction timeframe is approximately 60 days (May 2 to July 1, 2025).

This timeframe likely includes the next scheduled US State Department review (typically June for semiannual reviews). The timing is significant because:

- If the timeframe were halved (30 days), probability would decrease slightly (perhaps to 25-30%) as it might miss the June review cycle, though emergency updates remain possible.
- If doubled (120 days), probability would increase significantly (perhaps to 50-60%) as it would include both the June review and allow more time for situation deterioration or emergency updates.

## (d) Justification

Starting from the outside view base rate of 8%, several factors justify a substantial upward shift:

1. **Geographic expansion of terrorism (Strong)**: The May 2, 2025 reporting confirms terrorist activity has expanded to Niassa Province. This represents a significant deterioration not captured in the outside view. The US Embassy has already acknowledged these threats.

2. **Immediate US response in progress (Strong)**: According to multiple May 2 sources, the US Embassy has already issued specific warnings about terrorist movements in Niassa. This interim step often precedes formal advisory upgrades.

3. **Alignment with June review cycle (Moderate)**: The timing of these developments directly precedes what is likely the next scheduled review, increasing likelihood of formal reassessment.

4. **Combined threat profile (Strong)**: Mozambique now faces both expanding insurgency (now in three provinces) and continued political unrest. This combination exceeds the threat profile of the reference class used for the outside view.

These factors collectively represent a substantial deviation from the reference class that produced the 8% base rate. The geographic expansion of terrorism to a third province, combined with the US Embassy's immediate response and ongoing civil unrest, presents a qualitatively different security environment that warrants a significant adjustment.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 8%, I need to adjust based on the evidence analysis:

The most significant factor is the May 2, 2025 confirmation of terrorist activity expanding to Niassa Province, with the US Embassy already issuing specific warnings. This represents a material change in circumstances that wasn't captured in the outside view.

When calibrating:
- The existing US Embassy warnings about Niassa suggest the process of reassessment is already underway
- Multiple Western allies have already upgraded their warnings for Mozambique
- The June review provides a natural mechanism for formalization
- The dual threats of terrorism and civil unrest create a compelling case for elevation

Given the strength of the evidence showing geographic expansion of threats and diplomatic signaling, a substantial adjustment is warranted. However, I must avoid overconfidence given the US government's sometimes unpredictable decision-making process.

Taking all factors into account, I assess there is a 35% chance that Mozambique will receive a US State Department Level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory before July 1, 2025.

# Checklist:
1. Will Mozambique receive a Level 4 "Do Not Travel" US advisory before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view: 8% chance based on similar countries with insurgencies and political unrest.
3. 35 times out of 100, Mozambique would receive a Level 4 advisory given current circumstances.
4. Key evidence: Terrorist expansion to Niassa; US Embassy already warning about Niassa; UK just issued new advisories; coming June review cycle.
5. Blind spot: Reports of Niassa terrorist activity could be exaggerated or quickly contained.
6. Status quo is changing with very recent (May 2) deterioration in security situation.

Probability: 35%
Predicted Probability: 35.0%

Analysis:

1. Paraphrase & Resolution  
   Will the US State Department elevate Mozambique’s travel advisory to Level 4 (“Do Not Travel”) by July 1, 2025? Outcome is Yes if a Level 4 advisory is published before that date.

2. Outside-View Base Rate  
   As of early May 2025, ~8–9% of all countries have Level 4 advisories. Among African nations with post‐election unrest, a handful (Haiti, Venezuela) have been upgraded to Level 4 within months of crises. The UK has already issued its highest warning for parts of Mozambique; the US has not.

3. Source Analysis  
   • InsureMyTrip (Oct 2021): Detailed, factual background on US advisory levels and review cycles (semi‐annual for Level 3/4). Reliable baseline.  
   • Perplexity report (Mar 2025): Lists 17 countries currently at Level 4; notes triggers (armed conflict, terrorism, political instability). Well‐researched.  
   • Liverpool Echo (Jan 6 2025): Reports UK’s upgrade to “all but essential travel” nationally, “avoid travel” to Cabo Delgado districts; cites prison break (1,500 escapees) and violent protests. Reliable quotation of FCDO.  
   • EWN (Nov 7 2024) & SABC News (Dec 2 2024): Report South Africa’s “postpone non-essential visits” advisory and border closures during protests. Good regional context.  
   • AskNews collection (May 2 2025): Multiple outlets confirm ongoing insurgent attacks in Cabo Delgado/Niassa, kidnappings, civil unrest, and that the US Embassy has warned citizens to “reconsider” travel to Niassa.  

   Weigh factual reports (violent protests; insurgent attacks; kidnapping risks) higher than speculative or outdated commentary.

4. Evidence Analysis (weightings)  
   Strong evidence:  
   – UK “all but essential travel” downgrade nationwide (Liverpool Echo). Aligns Western‐government risk assessment.  
   – Persistent, violent, insurgency‐driven kidnappings and attacks in Cabo Delgado and Niassa, confirmed by US Embassy notes.  
   Moderate evidence:  
   – Semi-annual review cycle suggests next routine Level 4 review isn’t until ~Nov 2025.  
   – Canadian advisory “avoid all travel” in key districts.  
   Weak evidence:  
   – No reported systematic targeting of Americans specifically.  
   – Tourist areas in central Mozambique reportedly less affected.

5. Timeframe Analysis  
   Prediction window ≈2 months.  
   – Level 4 reviews occur semi-annually (next scheduled May/Nov). The US issued its current batch May 1 2025, so routine upgrades unlikely before July.  
   – Exceptional crises could prompt off-cycle updates; however, no shock event (e.g., mass hostage taking of Americans) is imminent.  
   If timeframe were halved (~1 month), chance would drop further (few days for crisis). If doubled (~4 months), chance would rise (more time for deterioration or review).

6. Justification & Inside-View Adjustment  
   Base rate (~9%) raised by:  
   – UK’s highest warning nationwide (strong alignment).  
   – Ongoing violent insurgency and protests persisting >6 months (structural risk).  
   But tempered by:  
   – US review cycle timing (strong institutional inertia).  
   – No wholesale collapse or foreign‐targeted mass kidnappings (severity below many current Level 4 cases).  
   – Partial containment: major cities outside Cabo Delgado remain relatively stable.

   Net shift: modest upward adjustment from base rate but significant downward drag from review‐cycle timing.

Probability calibration  
Given the strong signals from peer governments and persistent unrest, but the low likelihood of an off-cycle upgrade and middling severity, I assign a 30% probability.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast whether the US will issue a Level 4 travel advisory for Mozambique by July 1, 2025.  
2. Base‐rate: ~9% of countries hold Level 4; few get newly upgraded mid-year.  
3. Consistency: “30 out of 100 times, Mozambique’s advisory will be raised to Level 4.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – UK Level 4 for parts (strong peer signal).  
   – Semi-annual review schedule (structural inertia).  
   – Persistent insurgent violence and kidnappings (strong risk factor).  
   – No major American‐targeted crisis (limits upgrade).  
5. Blind‐spot: A sudden, high-profile kidnapping of US citizens could force an off-cycle upgrade, raising probability.  
6. Status quo: Advisory levels change slowly; absent a shock, US likely retains “Reconsider Travel” (Level 3).

Probability: 30%
Predicted Probability: 30.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Perplexity_report (Mar 2025): Aggregates US Level 4 upgrades since 2020, their triggers (conflict, terrorism, health), and review cycles. Reliable synthesis of past patterns but secondary.  
2. InsureMyTrip (Oct 2021): Explains US four-tier advisory system and review cadence. Authoritative on process, minimal opinion.  
3. UK FCDO “only essential” warning (Jan 6 2025 – Liverpool Echo, Bristol Post): UK raised Mozambique to “against all but essential travel” post-election unrest. Credible, directly sourced from FCO statements.  
4. Travel.gc.ca (current): Canada “avoid non-essential/all travel” in Cabo Delgado and Erati/Memba. Authoritative for Canadian view; signals heightened risk but not a US decision.  
5. AskNews aggregated articles (May 2 2025): Detail Islamist insurgency in Cabo Delgado and Niassa, hostage-taking in Reserva Especial do Niassa, and mass protests/violent clashes (250+ dead). Multiple outlets (DW, RTP, Noticias ao Minuto) confirm active militant threat.  
6. News on protests (NYT Jan 2 2025; Zimbabwe Mail Nov 14 2024): Chronicled tens of thousands protesting post-election, at least 30–250 deaths, calls for regional envoy. High-quality sources, direct eyewitness accounts.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
- UK’s near-Level 4 stance (strong allied signal).  
- Ongoing IS-linked insurgency in Cabo Delgado and now Niassa (direct terror risk).  
- Post-election protests with high fatalities, violent clashes.  
Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
- Canada’s “avoid non-essential” for much of Cabo Delgado.  
- Historical pattern: ~2 country upgrades to Level 4/year; US lag to UK/Canada.  
Weak evidence (small shifts):  
- Border delays, crime in Maputo; anecdotal kidnappings.  
- South African miner setbacks at Lebombo border.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today is May 2 2025; cutoff July 1 2025 → ~60 days. The State Department has a semiannual review (likely June), plus potential ad hoc updates. If the window were halved (30 days), our probability would roughly halve (less time for a reaction). If doubled (120 days), probability would rise but still capped by US caution threshold.

(d) Justification & inside view  
1. Outside-view base rate: US averages ~2 new country-specific Level 4 advisories per year → ~1–2% annual for any given Level 2/3 country.  
2. Time compression to 60 days (⅙ year) → ~0.25% base.  
3. Risk uplift: Mozambique’s combined civil unrest, IS-linked insurgency, high civilian/police casualties, and allied UK “only essential” advisories strengthen the case. Apply ~20× uplift → ~5%.  
4. Convergence factor: US typically follows allied upgrades within months; apply ~3× → ~15%.  
5. Final tweak for near-term volatility and upcoming scheduled review → +2 points → ~17%.  

Thus, while the chance remains well below even odds (the US reserves Level 4 for the most severe scenarios), Mozambique’s escalating unrest and allied signals push it meaningfully above its raw time-adjusted base rate.

Probability calibration  
Given the 60-day window, a base compressed probability of ~0.25% is uplifted by structural risk and allied signals to ~17%. A ±10% shift here (i.e., 15–20%) corresponds to modest changes in US risk calculus (e.g., a sudden mass kidnapping or spike in terror attacks could push toward 25–30%, while de-escalation or effective government response could push toward 5–10%).

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will Mozambique be issued a US Level 4 ‘Do Not Travel’ advisory before July 1 2025?” (60 days).  
2. Base rate: ~1.5% annual; time-compressed to ~0.25% for 60 days.  
3. Consistency: “17 out of 100 times, the US upgrades Mozambique to Level 4 before July 1 2025.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • UK “only essential” upgrade (strong).  
   • Active IS-linked insurgency in Cabo Delgado/Niassa (strong).  
   • Post-election protests with high casualties (strong).  
   • Historical US upgrade frequency and lag (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: A massive terror attack on foreign targets or a mass kidnapping of Westerners—if this occurs, probability could jump >>50%.  
6. Status quo: US has not upgraded yet; large policy shifts are rare absent major triggers.

Probability: 17%
Predicted Probability: 17.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Travel.gc.ca page (undated, pulled May 2025).  Government site, factual, describes persistent Cabo Delgado insurgency and post-election unrest.  High reliability; mostly facts, no speculative opinions.  
• NY Times, 2 Jan 2025.  International-desk reporting on late-2024 election protests, >250 dead.  Reputable newspaper; quotes eyewitnesses and activists—moderate reliability for numbers, high for fact protests occurred.  
• Zimbabwe Mail, 14 Nov 2024.  Regional paper quoting named academics and civil-society leaders urging SADC intervention.  Moderate reliability; facts about 30 deaths credible, commentary is opinion.  
• UK FCDO / Liverpool Echo, 6 Jan 2025.  Cites official UK travel warning (against all but essential travel) and prison-break story.  High reliability for the FCDO policy change; background colour is journalistic.  
• Notícias ao Minuto, DW, RTP (all 2 May 2025).  Quote Portuguese-language statements by UK FCDO and Mozambican police on two insurgent attacks in Niassa.  Multiple independent outlets; good factual convergence, high reliability that attacks happened.  
• Prensa Latina, 30 Apr 2025.  Official Mozambican numbers on protest-related police casualties.  Government-sourced; probable under-count of overall violence but still factual that protests have tailed off.  
• Generic “US issues Level-4 for 21 countries” stories, 1-2 May 2025.  Show the State Department still issuing whole-country L-4s elsewhere (Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, etc.), confirming the mechanism is active.  Not directly about Mozambique; low direct relevance.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
– Seven-year history: Mozambique never received a country-wide Level 4 despite chronic Cabo Delgado insurgency. (Structural, hard to change.)  
– US travel policy pattern: prefers Level 3 country-wide + Level 4 for specific provinces when risk is localised. (Historical pattern, strong predictive power.)  
Moderate evidence  
– Fresh Niassa attacks acknowledged by U.S. Embassy 2 May 2025; Embassy language “reconsider travel” (Level 3) for the area, not national. (Single reliable source; scope limited.)  
– UK downgraded nationwide warning in Jan 2025, retaining exclusions only for north. Indicates perceived reduction in broad unrest. (Government source, some predictive value.)  
– Election-related protests (Oct-Dec 2024) caused >250 deaths but have largely subsided according to multiple outlets and Attorney-General statement, suggesting downward trend.  
Weak evidence  
– Regional calls (SADC envoy, South-African industry) warning of economic impact.  Mostly opinion; limited direct link to U.S. advisory decision.  
– Speculative press pieces lumping Mozambique into generic “23 countries” lists at Level 3.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until 1 Jul 2025: ~60.  Historically, ~2-3 unscheduled country-level L-4 upgrades per year worldwide ⇒ base chance for any given country ≈ 0.3–0.5 % in a 60-day window.  
If timeframe halved to 30 days, probability ≈ 0.6× current estimate (risk accumulates roughly linearly).  If doubled to 120 days, probability would roughly double, but still well below 5 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Base rate (sub-Saharan “medium-risk” states jumping to L-4 in 60 days) ≈ 0.5 %.  
+0.2  pp  Fresh Niassa attacks show militants expanding beyond Cabo Delgado; U.S. Embassy already warning.  
+0.1  pp  Possibility of knock-on protests if promised political reforms stall.  
−0.1  pp  Visible de-escalation: UK and Canada easing or maintaining—but not escalating—nationwide guidance; protests waning.  
−0.1  pp  Persistent U.S. pattern of partial (province-level) Level 4 rather than nationwide blanket.  
Inside-view point estimate ≈ 0.6–0.7 %.  Rounded to the nearest whole percent for clarity: 1 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that 1 out of 100 similar 60-day periods would see Mozambique (or a comparable country) elevated to a full Level 4.  A ±10 % relative shift (0.9 %–1.1 %) would not change my qualitative judgment; a five-fold spike in nationwide violence or a major cholera/Ebola outbreak would be required to move the forecast into the 5 – 10 % range.

Checklist:
1  Title paraphrase: “Mozambique gets a U.S. Level 4 ‘Do Not Travel’ advisory before 1 Jul 2025.”  
2  Outside base: 0.5 % in 60 days; used as anchor.  
3  Consistency: “About 1 in 100 times, Mozambique is bumped to Level 4 in the next two months.”  
4  Key evidence: (i) persistent U.S. preference for partial Level 4s; (ii) Niassa insurgent spill-over; (iii) UK downgrade; (iv) protests subsiding; (v) no precedent of full L-4 despite years of turmoil.  
5  Blind-spot: sudden nationwide Ebola or coup triggering mass evacuation could raise probability >20 %.  
6  Status-quo bias checked; escalation path requires sharp shock unlikely in 60 days.

# Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Travel.gc.ca (Canadian advisory, current)**
- Official Canadian government assessment showing high-level concerns
- Advises against all travel to 14 districts of Cabo Delgado Province and 2 districts in Nampula due to insurgent activity
- Credible source with detailed security breakdown

**NYT article (Jan 2, 2025, 4 months old)**
- Reputable international source reporting widespread protests following contested election
- Reports 250+ deaths in clashes between security forces and protesters
- Details nationwide political instability triggered by electoral dispute

**Zimbabwe Mail (Nov 14, 2024, 6 months old)**
- Reports 30+ deaths from protests with expert opinions from named sources
- Adriano Nuvunga (Centre for Democracy and Human Rights) and Prof. Peter Baur provide informed analysis
- Details cross-border impacts and South Africa's travel advisories

**Recent news articles (May 1-2, 2025)**
- Multiple sources reporting UK FCDO's new advisory against travel to Niassa districts
- Very current (days old) information showing geographic expansion of insurgency
- Reports of terrorist attacks and hostage-taking at a hunting lodge in Niassa
- US Embassy warning mentioned (advising to "reconsider travel" to Niassa)
- Lists of 21 countries under US Level 4 advisories - Mozambique NOT included

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Geographic spread of insurgency:** Multiple reliable sources confirm expansion of terrorist activity from Cabo Delgado to Niassa Province with Mozambican Defense Minister Cristóvão Chume confirming "they are terrorists and we are after them." (May 2025)
- **Allied nations' warnings:** UK and Canadian governments advise against all travel to specific districts, with UK adding two Niassa districts very recently (May 2025)
- **Current absence from Level 4 list:** Multiple recent sources explicitly list 21 countries with Level 4 US travel advisories, and Mozambique is not among them (May 2025)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Ongoing political instability:** Multiple sources confirm protests continuing since October 2024 election, with varying estimates of casualties (30-250+ deaths)
- **Hostage-taking incident:** Recent reports of terrorists taking hostages at a hunting lodge in Niassa (May 2025)
- **US Embassy's current response:** Embassy issued "reconsider travel" advisory (Level 3) for Niassa region rather than Level 4 despite recent hostage situation (May 2025)

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Prison break:** Report of 1,500 inmates escaping (from older sources)
- **Border disruptions:** Affects regional travel but less relevant to US advisory decisions

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question asks about a Level 4 advisory before July 1, 2025, leaving approximately 2 months from today (May 2, 2025).

- If the timeframe were halved (1 month), probability would decrease to ~15% as there would be less time for security situation to deteriorate further and for US State Department to complete assessment process
- If doubled (4 months), probability would increase to ~30% due to additional time for insurgency patterns to be established and documented

## (d) Justification

Several factors suggest Mozambique could receive a Level 4 advisory:
1. The insurgency has recently expanded beyond Cabo Delgado to Niassa Province
2. Recent hostage-taking incidents represent escalation of threat to foreigners
3. UK has just issued its highest warning level for Niassa districts
4. Ongoing political instability creates nationwide unpredictability

However, stronger factors argue against a Level 4 advisory being issued within 2 months:
1. The insurgency remains regional rather than countrywide (unlike most Level 4 countries)
2. The US Embassy already assessed the Niassa situation and issued a Level 3 ("reconsider travel") rather than Level 4 advisory
3. Cabo Delgado insurgency has persisted since 2017 without triggering a US Level 4 advisory
4. Political violence has been ongoing for 7 months without escalation to Level 4
5. Mozambique not currently among the 21 countries with Level 4 advisories

# Probability calibration

Based on the evidence, I need to calibrate my assessment with comparable reference classes:

- Countries with insurgencies contained to specific regions typically receive regional Level 4 advisories only if foreign nationals are specifically targeted
- The US has historically had a higher threshold than allies for issuing Level 4 advisories
- The immediate US Embassy response to Niassa (Level 3 not Level 4) despite hostage situation provides the strongest current signal of US assessment
- Level 4 is reserved for the most dangerous places globally with widespread conflict, terrorism, or state hostility toward Americans

The most compelling evidence suggests that while the situation in Mozambique is concerning, it hasn't yet crossed the threshold for a Level 4 advisory despite clear opportunities for the US to make that determination. The specific targeting of foreigners in Niassa presents the most likely pathway to a Level 4 advisory, but the initial US response suggests they don't yet view it at that level of severity.

Given these factors, I assess there is approximately a 20% chance that Mozambique will receive a Level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory before July 1, 2025.

# Checklist:
1. Will Mozambique receive a Level 4 US travel advisory before July 1, 2025?
2. Base: Countries with regional insurgencies but not countrywide collapse typically ~20% chance
3. 20/100 times, the US would issue a Level 4 advisory for Mozambique in this situation
4. Key evidence: 
   - US already assessed Niassa situation at Level 3 not Level 4
   - Cabo Delgado insurgency ongoing since 2017 without Level 4
   - UK's new "avoid all travel" warning for Niassa
   - Recent terrorist hostage-taking incident
5. Blind spot: Dramatic deterioration involving US citizens as hostages
6. Status quo has been maintained despite 7+ months of unrest and years of regional insurgency

Probability: 20%
Predicted Probability: 20.0%

   - Older sources showing evolution of UK travel advisories
   - Document fluctuations in security assessment

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence
1. **Geographic expansion of terrorist threat**
   - Multiple independent sources confirm new attacks in Niassa Province
   - US Embassy has already issued specific warnings about terrorist movements in Niassa (May 2, 2025)
   - Direct causal mechanism: expansion of security threats is a primary driver for Level 4 designations

2. **Diplomatic alignment on escalating threats**
   - UK has just issued new warnings for Niassa districts (May 2, 2025)
   - Canada maintains high-level warnings for multiple regions
   - Historical pattern shows diplomatic coordination on security assessments

3. **Dual security threats**
   - Terrorism: Expanding from Cabo Delgado to Nampula and now Niassa
   - Civil unrest: Ongoing protests since October 2024 election
   - Combined threats typically warrant higher advisory levels

### Moderate Evidence
1. **Violence statistics**
   - Recent reports of 22 police deaths and 178 injuries (April 30, 2025)
   - Previous reporting of 250+ civilian deaths since late 2024
   - Scale suggests significant security deterioration

2. **Timing relative to review cycle**
   - Current date (May 2) suggests June 2025 would be next regular review period
   - New security developments provide justification for reassessment

3. **Ongoing political instability**
   - Disputed election remains unresolved
   - Opposition figure not participating in reconciliation talks

### Weak Evidence
1. **Previous non-inclusion in Level 4 list**
   - Mozambique not among 21 countries receiving Level 4 on May 1, 2025
   - But doesn't account for very recent Niassa developments

2. **Earlier improvement claims**
   - Some January 2025 sources suggested improved situation
   - Contradicted by more recent violence reports

## (c) Timeframe Analysis
The prediction timeframe is approximately 60 days (May 2 to July 1, 2025).

This timeframe likely includes the next scheduled US State Department review (typically June for semiannual reviews). The timing is significant because:

- If the timeframe were halved (30 days), probability would decrease slightly (perhaps to 25-30%) as it might miss the June review cycle, though emergency updates remain possible.
- If doubled (120 days), probability would increase significantly (perhaps to 50-60%) as it would include both the June review and allow more time for situation deterioration or emergency updates.

## (d) Justification

Starting from the outside view base rate of 8%, several factors justify a substantial upward shift:

1. **Geographic expansion of terrorism (Strong)**: The May 2, 2025 reporting confirms terrorist activity has expanded to Niassa Province. This represents a significant deterioration not captured in the outside view. The US Embassy has already acknowledged these threats.

2. **Immediate US response in progress (Strong)**: According to multiple May 2 sources, the US Embassy has already issued specific warnings about terrorist movements in Niassa. This interim step often precedes formal advisory upgrades.

3. **Alignment with June review cycle (Moderate)**: The timing of these developments directly precedes what is likely the next scheduled review, increasing likelihood of formal reassessment.

4. **Combined threat profile (Strong)**: Mozambique now faces both expanding insurgency (now in three provinces) and continued political unrest. This combination exceeds the threat profile of the reference class used for the outside view.

These factors collectively represent a substantial deviation from the reference class that produced the 8% base rate. The geographic expansion of terrorism to a third province, combined with the US Embassy's immediate response and ongoing civil unrest, presents a qualitatively different security environment that warrants a significant adjustment.

# Probability calibration

Starting with the outside view base rate of 8%, I need to adjust based on the evidence analysis:

The most significant factor is the May 2, 2025 confirmation of terrorist activity expanding to Niassa Province, with the US Embassy already issuing specific warnings. This represents a material change in circumstances that wasn't captured in the outside view.

When calibrating:
- The existing US Embassy warnings about Niassa suggest the process of reassessment is already underway
- Multiple Western allies have already upgraded their warnings for Mozambique
- The June review provides a natural mechanism for formalization
- The dual threats of terrorism and civil unrest create a compelling case for elevation

Given the strength of the evidence showing geographic expansion of threats and diplomatic signaling, a substantial adjustment is warranted. However, I must avoid overconfidence given the US government's sometimes unpredictable decision-making process.

Taking all factors into account, I assess there is a 35% chance that Mozambique will receive a US State Department Level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory before July 1, 2025.

# Checklist:
1. Will Mozambique receive a Level 4 "Do Not Travel" US advisory before July 1, 2025?
2. Outside view: 8% chance based on similar countries with insurgencies and political unrest.
3. 35 times out of 100, Mozambique would receive a Level 4 advisory given current circumstances.
4. Key evidence: Terrorist expansion to Niassa; US Embassy already warning about Niassa; UK just issued new advisories; coming June review cycle.
5. Blind spot: Reports of Niassa terrorist activity could be exaggerated or quickly contained.
6. Status quo is changing with very recent (May 2) deterioration in security situation.

Probability: 35%
Predicted Probability: 35.0%

1. Paraphrase & Resolution  
   Will the US State Department elevate Mozambique’s travel advisory to Level 4 (“Do Not Travel”) by July 1, 2025? Outcome is Yes if a Level 4 advisory is published before that date.

2. Outside-View Base Rate  
   As of early May 2025, ~8–9% of all countries have Level 4 advisories. Among African nations with post‐election unrest, a handful (Haiti, Venezuela) have been upgraded to Level 4 within months of crises. The UK has already issued its highest warning for parts of Mozambique; the US has not.

3. Source Analysis  
   • InsureMyTrip (Oct 2021): Detailed, factual background on US advisory levels and review cycles (semi‐annual for Level 3/4). Reliable baseline.  
   • Perplexity report (Mar 2025): Lists 17 countries currently at Level 4; notes triggers (armed conflict, terrorism, political instability). Well‐researched.  
   • Liverpool Echo (Jan 6 2025): Reports UK’s upgrade to “all but essential travel” nationally, “avoid travel” to Cabo Delgado districts; cites prison break (1,500 escapees) and violent protests. Reliable quotation of FCDO.  
   • EWN (Nov 7 2024) & SABC News (Dec 2 2024): Report South Africa’s “postpone non-essential visits” advisory and border closures during protests. Good regional context.  
   • AskNews collection (May 2 2025): Multiple outlets confirm ongoing insurgent attacks in Cabo Delgado/Niassa, kidnappings, civil unrest, and that the US Embassy has warned citizens to “reconsider” travel to Niassa.  

   Weigh factual reports (violent protests; insurgent attacks; kidnapping risks) higher than speculative or outdated commentary.

4. Evidence Analysis (weightings)  
   Strong evidence:  
   – UK “all but essential travel” downgrade nationwide (Liverpool Echo). Aligns Western‐government risk assessment.  
   – Persistent, violent, insurgency‐driven kidnappings and attacks in Cabo Delgado and Niassa, confirmed by US Embassy notes.  
   Moderate evidence:  
   – Semi-annual review cycle suggests next routine Level 4 review isn’t until ~Nov 2025.  
   – Canadian advisory “avoid all travel” in key districts.  
   Weak evidence:  
   – No reported systematic targeting of Americans specifically.  
   – Tourist areas in central Mozambique reportedly less affected.

5. Timeframe Analysis  
   Prediction window ≈2 months.  
   – Level 4 reviews occur semi-annually (next scheduled May/Nov). The US issued its current batch May 1 2025, so routine upgrades unlikely before July.  
   – Exceptional crises could prompt off-cycle updates; however, no shock event (e.g., mass hostage taking of Americans) is imminent.  
   If timeframe were halved (~1 month), chance would drop further (few days for crisis). If doubled (~4 months), chance would rise (more time for deterioration or review).

6. Justification & Inside-View Adjustment  
   Base rate (~9%) raised by:  
   – UK’s highest warning nationwide (strong alignment).  
   – Ongoing violent insurgency and protests persisting >6 months (structural risk).  
   But tempered by:  
   – US review cycle timing (strong institutional inertia).  
   – No wholesale collapse or foreign‐targeted mass kidnappings (severity below many current Level 4 cases).  
   – Partial containment: major cities outside Cabo Delgado remain relatively stable.

   Net shift: modest upward adjustment from base rate but significant downward drag from review‐cycle timing.

Probability calibration  
Given the strong signals from peer governments and persistent unrest, but the low likelihood of an off-cycle upgrade and middling severity, I assign a 30% probability.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Forecast whether the US will issue a Level 4 travel advisory for Mozambique by July 1, 2025.  
2. Base‐rate: ~9% of countries hold Level 4; few get newly upgraded mid-year.  
3. Consistency: “30 out of 100 times, Mozambique’s advisory will be raised to Level 4.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – UK Level 4 for parts (strong peer signal).  
   – Semi-annual review schedule (structural inertia).  
   – Persistent insurgent violence and kidnappings (strong risk factor).  
   – No major American‐targeted crisis (limits upgrade).  
5. Blind‐spot: A sudden, high-profile kidnapping of US citizens could force an off-cycle upgrade, raising probability.  
6. Status quo: Advisory levels change slowly; absent a shock, US likely retains “Reconsider Travel” (Level 3).

Probability: 30%
Predicted Probability: 30.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Perplexity_report (Mar 2025): Aggregates US Level 4 upgrades since 2020, their triggers (conflict, terrorism, health), and review cycles. Reliable synthesis of past patterns but secondary.  
2. InsureMyTrip (Oct 2021): Explains US four-tier advisory system and review cadence. Authoritative on process, minimal opinion.  
3. UK FCDO “only essential” warning (Jan 6 2025 – Liverpool Echo, Bristol Post): UK raised Mozambique to “against all but essential travel” post-election unrest. Credible, directly sourced from FCO statements.  
4. Travel.gc.ca (current): Canada “avoid non-essential/all travel” in Cabo Delgado and Erati/Memba. Authoritative for Canadian view; signals heightened risk but not a US decision.  
5. AskNews aggregated articles (May 2 2025): Detail Islamist insurgency in Cabo Delgado and Niassa, hostage-taking in Reserva Especial do Niassa, and mass protests/violent clashes (250+ dead). Multiple outlets (DW, RTP, Noticias ao Minuto) confirm active militant threat.  
6. News on protests (NYT Jan 2 2025; Zimbabwe Mail Nov 14 2024): Chronicled tens of thousands protesting post-election, at least 30–250 deaths, calls for regional envoy. High-quality sources, direct eyewitness accounts.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (large shifts):  
- UK’s near-Level 4 stance (strong allied signal).  
- Ongoing IS-linked insurgency in Cabo Delgado and now Niassa (direct terror risk).  
- Post-election protests with high fatalities, violent clashes.  
Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):  
- Canada’s “avoid non-essential” for much of Cabo Delgado.  
- Historical pattern: ~2 country upgrades to Level 4/year; US lag to UK/Canada.  
Weak evidence (small shifts):  
- Border delays, crime in Maputo; anecdotal kidnappings.  
- South African miner setbacks at Lebombo border.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today is May 2 2025; cutoff July 1 2025 → ~60 days. The State Department has a semiannual review (likely June), plus potential ad hoc updates. If the window were halved (30 days), our probability would roughly halve (less time for a reaction). If doubled (120 days), probability would rise but still capped by US caution threshold.

(d) Justification & inside view  
1. Outside-view base rate: US averages ~2 new country-specific Level 4 advisories per year → ~1–2% annual for any given Level 2/3 country.  
2. Time compression to 60 days (⅙ year) → ~0.25% base.  
3. Risk uplift: Mozambique’s combined civil unrest, IS-linked insurgency, high civilian/police casualties, and allied UK “only essential” advisories strengthen the case. Apply ~20× uplift → ~5%.  
4. Convergence factor: US typically follows allied upgrades within months; apply ~3× → ~15%.  
5. Final tweak for near-term volatility and upcoming scheduled review → +2 points → ~17%.  

Thus, while the chance remains well below even odds (the US reserves Level 4 for the most severe scenarios), Mozambique’s escalating unrest and allied signals push it meaningfully above its raw time-adjusted base rate.

Probability calibration  
Given the 60-day window, a base compressed probability of ~0.25% is uplifted by structural risk and allied signals to ~17%. A ±10% shift here (i.e., 15–20%) corresponds to modest changes in US risk calculus (e.g., a sudden mass kidnapping or spike in terror attacks could push toward 25–30%, while de-escalation or effective government response could push toward 5–10%).

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Will Mozambique be issued a US Level 4 ‘Do Not Travel’ advisory before July 1 2025?” (60 days).  
2. Base rate: ~1.5% annual; time-compressed to ~0.25% for 60 days.  
3. Consistency: “17 out of 100 times, the US upgrades Mozambique to Level 4 before July 1 2025.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • UK “only essential” upgrade (strong).  
   • Active IS-linked insurgency in Cabo Delgado/Niassa (strong).  
   • Post-election protests with high casualties (strong).  
   • Historical US upgrade frequency and lag (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: A massive terror attack on foreign targets or a mass kidnapping of Westerners—if this occurs, probability could jump >>50%.  
6. Status quo: US has not upgraded yet; large policy shifts are rare absent major triggers.

Probability: 17%
Predicted Probability: 17.0%

Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Travel.gc.ca page (undated, pulled May 2025).  Government site, factual, describes persistent Cabo Delgado insurgency and post-election unrest.  High reliability; mostly facts, no speculative opinions.  
• NY Times, 2 Jan 2025.  International-desk reporting on late-2024 election protests, >250 dead.  Reputable newspaper; quotes eyewitnesses and activists—moderate reliability for numbers, high for fact protests occurred.  
• Zimbabwe Mail, 14 Nov 2024.  Regional paper quoting named academics and civil-society leaders urging SADC intervention.  Moderate reliability; facts about 30 deaths credible, commentary is opinion.  
• UK FCDO / Liverpool Echo, 6 Jan 2025.  Cites official UK travel warning (against all but essential travel) and prison-break story.  High reliability for the FCDO policy change; background colour is journalistic.  
• Notícias ao Minuto, DW, RTP (all 2 May 2025).  Quote Portuguese-language statements by UK FCDO and Mozambican police on two insurgent attacks in Niassa.  Multiple independent outlets; good factual convergence, high reliability that attacks happened.  
• Prensa Latina, 30 Apr 2025.  Official Mozambican numbers on protest-related police casualties.  Government-sourced; probable under-count of overall violence but still factual that protests have tailed off.  
• Generic “US issues Level-4 for 21 countries” stories, 1-2 May 2025.  Show the State Department still issuing whole-country L-4s elsewhere (Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, etc.), confirming the mechanism is active.  Not directly about Mozambique; low direct relevance.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
– Seven-year history: Mozambique never received a country-wide Level 4 despite chronic Cabo Delgado insurgency. (Structural, hard to change.)  
– US travel policy pattern: prefers Level 3 country-wide + Level 4 for specific provinces when risk is localised. (Historical pattern, strong predictive power.)  
Moderate evidence  
– Fresh Niassa attacks acknowledged by U.S. Embassy 2 May 2025; Embassy language “reconsider travel” (Level 3) for the area, not national. (Single reliable source; scope limited.)  
– UK downgraded nationwide warning in Jan 2025, retaining exclusions only for north. Indicates perceived reduction in broad unrest. (Government source, some predictive value.)  
– Election-related protests (Oct-Dec 2024) caused >250 deaths but have largely subsided according to multiple outlets and Attorney-General statement, suggesting downward trend.  
Weak evidence  
– Regional calls (SADC envoy, South-African industry) warning of economic impact.  Mostly opinion; limited direct link to U.S. advisory decision.  
– Speculative press pieces lumping Mozambique into generic “23 countries” lists at Level 3.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until 1 Jul 2025: ~60.  Historically, ~2-3 unscheduled country-level L-4 upgrades per year worldwide ⇒ base chance for any given country ≈ 0.3–0.5 % in a 60-day window.  
If timeframe halved to 30 days, probability ≈ 0.6× current estimate (risk accumulates roughly linearly).  If doubled to 120 days, probability would roughly double, but still well below 5 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Base rate (sub-Saharan “medium-risk” states jumping to L-4 in 60 days) ≈ 0.5 %.  
+0.2  pp  Fresh Niassa attacks show militants expanding beyond Cabo Delgado; U.S. Embassy already warning.  
+0.1  pp  Possibility of knock-on protests if promised political reforms stall.  
−0.1  pp  Visible de-escalation: UK and Canada easing or maintaining—but not escalating—nationwide guidance; protests waning.  
−0.1  pp  Persistent U.S. pattern of partial (province-level) Level 4 rather than nationwide blanket.  
Inside-view point estimate ≈ 0.6–0.7 %.  Rounded to the nearest whole percent for clarity: 1 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that 1 out of 100 similar 60-day periods would see Mozambique (or a comparable country) elevated to a full Level 4.  A ±10 % relative shift (0.9 %–1.1 %) would not change my qualitative judgment; a five-fold spike in nationwide violence or a major cholera/Ebola outbreak would be required to move the forecast into the 5 – 10 % range.

Checklist:
1  Title paraphrase: “Mozambique gets a U.S. Level 4 ‘Do Not Travel’ advisory before 1 Jul 2025.”  
2  Outside base: 0.5 % in 60 days; used as anchor.  
3  Consistency: “About 1 in 100 times, Mozambique is bumped to Level 4 in the next two months.”  
4  Key evidence: (i) persistent U.S. preference for partial Level 4s; (ii) Niassa insurgent spill-over; (iii) UK downgrade; (iv) protests subsiding; (v) no precedent of full L-4 despite years of turmoil.  
5  Blind-spot: sudden nationwide Ebola or coup triggering mass evacuation could raise probability >20 %.  
6  Status-quo bias checked; escalation path requires sharp shock unlikely in 60 days.

Probability: 1%
Predicted Probability: 1%...
