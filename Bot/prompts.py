Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context and current information:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Asknews articles), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Evidence analysis: Weight evidence/factors relevant to resolution criteria in the sources based on the below weighing system

Evidence weighing system for (b):
Strong evidence (can warrant relatively large prediction shifts)
- Multiple independent, reliable and identifiable (i.e., you can name the direct source) sources confirming same direction
- Direct causal mechanisms clearly established
- Historical patterns with strong predictive power
- Structural/institutional factors that are difficult to change

Moderate evidence (warrant moderate prediction shifts):
- Single reliable and identifiable source with clear methodology
- Indirect but logical causal links
- Similar historical patterns with some differences
- Current trends with demonstrated momentum

Weak evidence (small adjustments):
- Anecdotal evidence
- Speculative connections
- Limited historical parallels
- Short-term or volatile indicators

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds. How would a +-10% shift in probability resonate with your analysis?

You are suggested to use the below checklist to verify the quality of your forecast **while reasoning**. Adjust your forecast if you have made mistakes. You can very briefly add a shortened version to your answer (see the format below).

------------------------ FORECASTING CHECKLIST ------------------------
1. Paraphrase the title and resolution criteria in <30 words, including relevant time windows. 
  * Check that your analysis exactly aligns with how variables and resolution criterias are defined. Bait-and-switch errors, while commonplace, are costly.

2. State your outside view base rate distribution previously established
  * Check that your final prediction distribution genuinely is rooted to this base rate. If not, verify that current circumstances are vastly different from historic reference classes. Outside first, usually.

3. Consistency check (write a single line)
  * "{{your prediction}} out of 100 times, {{resolution criteria}} happens." Does this make sense and is it aligned with my justification?

4. Write down in <20 words each, the three-five most significant pieces of evidence influencing your final prediction.
  * Verify the factual validity of each of these pieces of evidence. You do not want your forecast to hinge on a few flimsy, possibly inconsistent, pieces of evidence. Use this to consider shifting confidence up or down.

5. Blind-spot statement
  * Name the one scenario most likely to make your forecast look silly in hindsight and decide how it might shift the relative probabilities assigned.

6. Status quo outcome
  * The world changes slowly most of the time. Consider the volatility of the current situation and timeframe to check whether a slight nudge toward the status quo outcome might be advantageous.

Today’s Date: {today}

Current Context (outside view + relevant evidence):
{context}
---

Your task has 3 parts:

### Part 1: Written Analysis
Write a concise but structured analysis covering:
(a) **Source Quality**: Evaluate sources in terms of recency, credibility, and scope.  
(b) **Evidence Weighting**: Identify major factors influencing the outcome. Use the weight classification below.  
(c) **Timeframe Reasoning**: Define how long until resolution, and how prediction might shift if the timeline changes.  
(d) **Justification**: Combine the above to justify your belief shift vs. outside view.

#### Evidence Weighing System:
- **Strong**: Multiple independent sources; clear causal mechanisms; strong historical precedent  
- **Moderate**: One good source; indirect links; weak precedent  
- **Weak**: Anecdotes; speculative logic; volatile indicators  

---

### Part 2: Monte Carlo Simulation Strategy
Design a simulation using key variables that drive the resolution.  
Explain each variable:
- What it represents  
- Its distribution and justification  
- Any assumptions, dependencies, or edge cases  
Be careful not to add too many variables and constraints, as this might skew your final probability to 0. A good range is between 2 to 4 variables with well-thought out distributions.The final proability from your simulation should be useful.

---

### Part 3: Python Code
Generate a **syntactically correct, executable Python 3 script** using NumPy.  
You must:
- Simulate at least 100,000 iterations
- Define and clearly document your key assumptions
- Return the **probability** of the outcome as a float between 0 and 1
- Your code should ONLY contain comments using #, NO comments should be triple quotes.
- Your code should consist of a function definition and a single print statement outside, at the end to print the **final probability **between 1 and 100 with a % sign following the number**. Please do not use something like if __name__ == "__main__": before the print statement, it will not run.

Exact output format (you must follow this format exactly):
<python>
# your full code goes here

#Output must be **exactly** formatted as below:

The final output should only include:
1. Your written analysis
2. Your simulation strategy

(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Perplexity report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.
- Always start with a smaller number (more negative if negative) and then increase from there

The information has been sourced from the internet, so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your task has 3 parts:

### Part 1: Written Analysis
Write a concise but structured analysis covering:
(a) **Source Quality**: Evaluate sources in terms of recency, credibility, and scope.  
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) **Evidence Weighting**: Identify major factors influencing the outcome. Use the weight classification below.  
(c) **Timeframe Reasoning**: Define how long until resolution, and how prediction might shift if the timeline changes.  
(d) **Justification**: Combine the above to justify your belief shift vs. outside view.

#### Evidence Weighing System:
- **Strong**: Multiple independent sources; clear causal mechanisms; strong historical precedent  
- **Moderate**: One good source; indirect links; weak precedent  
- **Weak**: Anecdotes; speculative logic; volatile indicators  

---

### Part 2: Monte Carlo Simulation Strategy
Design a simulation using key variables that drive the resolution.  
Explain each variable:
- What it represents  
- Its distribution and justification  
- Any assumptions, dependencies, or edge cases  
Be careful not to add too many variables and constraints, as this might skew your final probability to 0. A good range is between 2 to 4 variables with well-thought out distributions. Your final distribution should be realistic and useful, without being extremely skewed.

---

### Part 3: Python Code
Generate a **syntactically correct, executable Python 3 script** using NumPy.  
You should:
- Sample from at least 10^6 iterations
- Define and clearly document your key assumptions using comments that start with #. Do not use triple-quoted strings for comments.
- Utilize NumPy's vectorized operations instead of Python for-loops to enhance performance and efficiency.
- Structure your code to include:
  - A function definition that performs the Monte Carlo simulation and calculates the desired percentiles.
  - A single print statement outside the function (**WITHOUT** using if __name__ == "__main__":) that calls the function and prints the final percentile list.
- Follow these instructions regarding the numerical percentiles:
  - Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
  - Never use scientific notation.

Exact output format (you must follow this format exactly):
<python>
# your full code goes here
</python>
# Output must be **exactly** printed as below:
Percentile 1: XX
Percentile 5: XX
Percentile 10: XX
Percentile 15: XX
Percentile 20: XX
Percentile 25: XX
Percentile 30: XX
Percentile 35: XX
Percentile 40: XX
Percentile 45: XX

Percentile 70: XX
Percentile 75: XX
Percentile 80: XX
Percentile 85: XX
Percentile 90: XX
Percentile 95: XX
Percentile 99: XX

The final output should only include:
1. Your written analysis
2. Your simulation strategy
3. Your full Python code block, in the EXACT format shown above.
4. NO FURTHER COMMENTS after the python code block, you are not to make your own forecast.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context and current information:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Asknews articles), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Evidence analysis: Weight evidence/factors relevant to resolution criteria in the sources based on the below weighing system
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and describe how your prediction might change if this was halfed/doubled? 
(d) Justification: Gather the most compelling factors and justify how they shift your outside view base rates. For large distribution shifts, justify how current factors are sufficiently impactful to render the reference class non-analogous to current circumstances.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion. 

Evidence weighing system for (b):
Strong evidence (can warrant relatively large prediction shifts)
- Multiple independent, reliable sources confirming same direction
- Direct causal mechanisms clearly established
- Historical patterns with strong predictive power
- Structural/institutional factors that are difficult to change

Moderate evidence (warrant moderate prediction shifts):
- Single reliable source with clear methodology
- Indirect but logical causal links
- Similar historical patterns with some differences
- Current trends with demonstrated momentum

Weak evidence (small adjustments):
- Anecdotal evidence
- Speculative connections
- Limited historical parallels
- Short-term or volatile indicators

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) The outcome if the current trend continued.
(b) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

Regarding the final prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.
- Always start with a smaller number (more negative if negative) and then increase from there

You are suggested to use the below checklist to verify the quality of your forecast **while reasoning**. Adjust your forecast if you have made mistakes. You can very briefly add a shortened version to your answer (see the format below).

------------------------ FORECASTING CHECKLIST ------------------------
1. Paraphrase the target variable/resolution criteria in <20 words, including units and the time window
  * Check that your analysis exactly aligns with this target variable/resolution criteria. Bait-and-switch errors, while commonplace, are costly.

2. State your outside view base rate previously established
  * Check that your final prediction genuinely is rooted to this base rate. If not, verify that current circumstances are vastly different from historic reference classes. Outside first, usually.

3. Consistency check (write a single line)
  * "Implied median = ____; mean = ____; does this make sense and aligned with my justification?"

4. Write down in <20 words each, the three-five most significant pieces of evidence influencing your final prediction.
  * Verify the factual validity of each of these pieces of evidence. You do not want your forecast to hinge on a few flimsy, possibly inconsistent, pieces of evidence. Use this to consider shifting confidence up or down.

5. Blind-spot statement
  * Name the one scenario most likely to make your forecast look silly in hindsight and decide whether it would push the outcome up or down.
